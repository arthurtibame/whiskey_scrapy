5.0,Love it! Smoothest rye I've ever tasted.
5.0,Excellent balance of caramel sweetness from the low rye with the cinnamon/holiday spice of the high rye.  Perfect neat as a daily drinker or in a rye cocktail.

2.0,"This is an extra, rye whiskey sample sent by the newest member of our tasting team: Telex.  Sagamore Spirits is a craft distillery based out of Baltimore, MD and this is sourced whiskey from Indiana that is blended on site, bottled and sold while they wait for the actual distillery to get up and running.  It’s not actual Sagamore product, but this is a common practice that new, small distilleries do to start returning investment to their business and the banks.  It is somewhat of a testament to their master distiller’s blending skill, though, so there is a bit of authenticity to it- but not a whole lot.

The nose on this one is typical rye spiciness with a bit of a strange sweetness that doesn’t exactly remind me of corn whiskey.  There’s also a bit of a strange furniture polish smell in play here, as well.

The palate is rye pepper, corn and plenty of raw oak.  The overall feel is very thin and watery- I guess they are stretching the sourced stuff as far as they can.  The finish is short, uneventful and heavy on the oak.

Overall, there’s nothing here to go nuts over, but it would be interesting to see what these guys get up to once they start making, aging and blending their own spirits.  Here’s to drinking local.  Thanks again, Jason.  Cheers."

3.0,"Another bonus sample from the distillery tour team, this one coming by way of Telex. Sagamore Spirit Rye is a Maryland style rye composed of two different rye recipes, both of which are MGP distillates. It’s a NAS American whiskey but available info puts it at 2 years old. Bottled at 41.5% ABV. No word as to whether it is chill filtered or has colorant added, but I would suspect both are at play. The color is a medium amber. 

The nose is fairly restrained with vanilla and dill as the predominant notes. Rye spice, sweet corn, bubblegum and cotton candy. Wood stain/varnish, which I actually liked. Some dark cherries, caramel and butterscotch. A light but pleasant oak with a little barrel char. A little maple comes through after some time. Not too powerful due to the lower ABV and it comes off as youthful, but not overly so. 

The palate has a real lack of complexity. Rye spice and lots of dill, perhaps too much dill (at least for my tastes). Corn, vanilla, a little oak, and some herbal and earthy notes. Not much else really. It’s all quite subdued, again owing to the relatively low strength. 

A light bodied mouthfeel, somewhat thin and fairly dry. 
A short finish with corn, vanilla and oak. 

It’s an easy drinking whiskey, but probably best left for mixing in cocktails as it doesn’t have much power to it and the flavors are somewhat muted. At $50 I suppose the cost is par for the craft distillery course. Not bad for only being two years old though. I would be interested in revising this after a few more years in the barrel. A solid 3. Thanks again Telex for the sample
Cheers"
4.0,"On the nose this has that inviting sweetness of many of the MGP whiskey's.  On the palate the lack of an alcohol burn really lets you enjoy the flavors. You get that rye spice with the dill pickle note that is followed by a good sweetness. The Finish is not too long but it is enjoyable.  I tasted this neat, but I could certainly see how it would be enjoyed in a Manhattan."

2.0,"Some must and then bourbon notes, based on the nose I wouldn't guess this to be a young rye. That comes on the palate though, definitely a youngeye, but actually pretty good. Slightly thin. Mild, nothing too harsh, some pleasant floral notes, vanilla, baking spice, a hint of cola and herbs at the end. Mild bitterness lingers a bit. Surprising, but I think the price point will hold it back a bit. It does make me interested in the cask strength version. 6/9/18"

2.0,"Thanks to Jason as part of our little trading team, I got to sample this craft distillery.   Craft distilleries are really a hit or miss.  How do they stay in business while waiting for their own product to mature?  Make gin?  Source from others?  Most do both, but it's rare to see one source from others and make something better ( like High West).  These guys at Sagamore seemed to have taken the route of blending two different ryes, hoping to create a sum greater than the individual parts.   It'll be interesting to see where these guys take their future products.  For now, seems like this one has some ways to go.  Nose is a bit artificial, almost like polish.  Taste is young rye, thin and minty.   It was interesting to try, but they have some ways to go before becoming the next High West, Wyoming Whiskey, or Westland."

2.25,"Deep in the bowels of the SDT samples that I am slowly working through, I pull this rye provided by @Telex.  Rye, if done poorly, can be a mess. If done well, can be a wonderful experience (ala Midwinters Night  Dram). This is a Baltimore Maryland, sourced spirit, and I am always interested in the local crafts; spirits, wine or beer. 

Nosing reveals rye spice with some sweetness. Dill, mint, pine resin with corn, vanilla and butterscotch.  More time draws out some woodiness and straw/hay notes and black licorice.  These notes arrive gently but with presence. 

The draw on the palate is spicy hot. A young spirit. Dill spice, black pepper spice are dominant. Some woodiness and sweetness of caramel and vanilla mix in with ryeness.  The body is thin and light. 

The palate fades out with dill, oak with some bitterness that all lasts for a blink of an eye. 

This is a rye that is best served as a mixer but is tolerable as a sipper.  It has potential to become something better.   Thanks Jason for the taste. [82/100][Tasted: 12/2/18]"

For being majority high rye blend their standard rye is very soft and mild and pallet is thin and not very bold. If you are expecting a spicy rye this offering and rye brand is not going to live up to that. However, if you are looking to did your feet into the rye category then this may be a good one to try."

3.0,Not bad in the lane of a rye and relatively affordable. Not really exciting either but solid daily drinker with a cube or two. On the nose I get alcohol a little candied Apple and smoother than expected looks like the guys at under armor aren’t just good at making clothing.  Cheers I would keep this around since it is comparable to its other cousin whistle pig 10 minus the oak undertones.

2.75,"Sagamore Spirit. While it may be sourced from MGP, it seems that they do their own blending and finishing (the former of which applies to this one). While they may not be putting out their own stock just yet, it seems that the Maryland-based distillery is aging their own distillate and well inevitably have its own product, from start to finish, out on the market. For now, let's take a look at the current, MGP-sourced base product.

Nose: Standard ""bready"" notes that I often find in ryes. Obviously rye bread, but also a bit of sourdough. Some apple cider, gala apple notes. Black pepper, nutmeg, and allspice. Dill pickle and spearmint. Hints of pistachio and vanilla. Some roasted nut.Greenish, cedar notes. It's mild but enjoyable. Balanced as opposed to sweet or spicy.

Palate: Caramel and vanilla. Black licorice. More of those apple notes, now accompanied by apricot. Still bready and green. Dill pickle. A bit sour, but nothing that I would consider off putting just a touch in that direction. Maybe even a bit of orange citrus. Cherry, ginger, and honey. There's a good amount going on here.

Finish: Short kick of spice. There's more of the rye breadiness and then a quick burst of cinnamon, black pepper, nutmeg, and clove. Suffers from a lack of ABV, as it's gone as quickly as it hits. Calling it short-medium would be generous.

Tough one to score. I think this was designed to be a background sipper. If that's the case, they certainly hit their mark. It's just unique enough to be noteworthy, but isn't exactly an attention-grabber. At 41.5% ABV, I think it's safe to say they were going for a more subtle approach.

Subtle it is. And while I very much enjoy this whiskey for what it is, I don't score these types of drams all too high. This is the Michelob Ultra of rye whiskey. And I'm not on a diet. While the nose and palate are surprisingly enjoyable, there is virtually no finish here.

The Maryland whiskey scene is the Wild West as far as I'm concerned. Pikesville is now distilled at Heaven Hill, and Sagamore's portfolio is technically Indiana whiskey. I remember trying the Sagamore Port Finish at a tasting; and I remember being impressed. Will have to try again. And while I give this 2.75 stars for now, I must say that I'd be willing to give them another go with the Port Finish. As for this, it's decent whiskey but nothing to go out of your way to try."
