3.75,"I quite liked this effort. Could be that I was offered a dram by the father of my daughter and sons friends when I was picking them up from a playdate. Tea, coffee and then whiskey was offered and I jumped at the latter. Good bowmore characteristics come through albeit at a low abv. Beats a tea or water!"
4.25,"Heavy peat on the nose, with a ton of leather and earthiness coming through. On the palate, I get a bit of tobacco smoke, with leather and a bit of the earthiness found typically in laphroaig. It is shockingly soft, and smooth to drink, but very heavy on the peat. Fairly rich, and a medium finish."

5.0,Fell in love with this expression from Bowmore right away. The sherry come wonderfully through and goes hand in hand with the usual peaty taste of a bowmore 12.
