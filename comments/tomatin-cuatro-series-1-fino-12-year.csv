3.25,I'm with DSH. Definite improvement from the terrible terrible Goldlys but yeah well used casking and not a lot going on. Tomatin can do great stuff but it's always flashes of greatness..most of their stuff is middling.

1.5,"OK so I didn't buy the PX finished bottle (wasn't at the store I bought these at) and I'll get into as I go through this.  Otherwise I'll focus on the FINO but this will be a side by side review.  

Nose - butter scotch, vanilla, a bit of dark fruits, perhaps some grape/wine elements.  Swirling I start to get some oak, almost buttered toast.  The Oloroso is drier more sherry dark fruits and less of the grape/wine element.  There's a lot less butter scotch and vanilla here.  Manzanilla has the vanilla notes but not the butter scotch.  It's sweeter and there's a lot more just overall to smell here, much more intense.  The Fino is somewhat muted.  

Taste - Spicy, it has a good vanilla note, some nice fino notes (I know).  Some fruity elements, light fruits, but spicy.  Oloroso - more spice, perhaps spicier.  chocolate, dark fruits (waxy).  There's more influence from the finishing I believe.  Manzanilla - sweet and oily, fruity, but no distinct finishing.  I could believe this was just a speyside though it's a bit too fruit forward and sweet imo to not have some finishing.  

My first comment is that these have incredibly improved from when i first opened them and I got nearly no finishing.  That said these are still fairly bourbon forward, likely some fairly well used casks for the secondary fill. 

Fino - overall this is an interesting drinker.  It's however not really for me.  12 years is a bit young for this one.  I think heavier finishing would really help if they were going for 12 years old.  That said I'm still really happy with this.  At 60+ I'd not recommend this unless you want to do a side by side comp like this. This is a bottle that isn't getting killed this year and maybe not next."
