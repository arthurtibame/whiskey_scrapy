5.0,"Excellent, excellent bourbon, as to be expected for the price. Bought this for a special occasion. 
Nose: Mild smoke smell, caramel, honey. Entry: Brown sugar, spice lots of honey, under tones almond, notes of vanilla. Mid-palate brings more of the same, with a hint of smoke arising. Finish: Long and lingering honey flavor, with mild hints of barrel smoke.
Overall, this is an incredibly sophisticated whiskey that's amazingly smooth yet very complex."

5.0,Smooth flavor with an almost mouth wash clean finish in the mouth. A little water and the other flavor a really open up to a complex tastes worthy of the price.
3.0,I tried this and felt that it was a little too smooth and mild for a Wild Turkey product. Nice flavor but lacking the spicy kick that one expects from this brand. Not worth the price.

5.0,A very nice taste with fruit undertones and some smokiness to it. A nice amount of spiciness makes this a complex bourbon and gives it a classic wild turkey profile.

5.0,"Color is more mahogany, expected a richer color for the age. The nose is mild, I get sweet vanilla and caramel with a nice wood/corn under tone. The palette is just as mild and sweet as the nose with hints of wood and chocolate. The finish is long warm and peppery. Very smooth sipper and a great pour.

4.0,"Batch No. B14-0035. Great nose. Caramel, butterscotch, a floral note. Smooth, but also thin, on the tongue. Decent sweetness, vanilla and wood notes. Some bitterness on the end. Perhaps not the familiar Wild Turkey punch, but pleasant sipper. 7/7/17
This has opened up. It's still thinner than other WT bottles but it's fuller than last time. Much more caramel and vanilla this time around. The spice is balancing. Bumping this up a star. 7/30/17 peanut notes have really developed as I get to the end of the bottle. Very flavorful for this proof. Will definitely pick up another bottle if I can find it for under $100. 10/20/17"

5.0,"This is a great bourbon. There's an amazing complexity and richness that solidifies with each sip. The nose is ripe with caramel and toasted nuts. The beautiful color is inviting and holds a pleasant sweetness accompanied by warmth rather than raw heat. This is smooth, enjoyable and easy (almost to a fault) to drink. The aging is evident and found myself intrigued by the flavor profile without opening it up with a drop of water. This is a true savorer's bourbon. The only downside is this one? A bit overpriced and out of reach for some. That's a pity because if you're a bourbon fan, you should try this. I myself would love another dram, but it's too rare and expensive to make an appearance in my collection. (FWF $10 Dram [1st] share #17)"

I’d say the value is parallel to the lovely Rare Breed and Kentucky spirit ~$60-$70 value.... not $130, but oh well. I like wild turkey.

5.0,Impress your friends with this bourbon. There’s something magical here where the bourbon rolls through a multitude of flavors that feel deep and everlasting. Good spice and smoke with just the right touch of heat that reminds you it’s a brand of Wild Turkey. The Diamond part comes in with just the slightest touch of vanilla and sweetness. Any bourbon lover needs to have a bottle of this in his or her arsenal.

Steep price will deter many buyers, which it should. Let’s face it, just about all bourbon is tasty, whether it’s $125 or just $25. Definitely glad  I got to try this, and so much of it too! 3.5/5"

4.0,"Taste:  Chilled neatly in a glen cairn glass

Nose:  (3.5)  Musty oak and barrel.  Characteristic Wild Turkey nose which pleases me.  Some vanilla but lacks some in complexity.

Palate: (4.25) The oak is upfront but gives way to an almost peanut brittle sweetness.  As it catches air it releases more flavor like cherry syrup, and rye bread.  What this lacks in complexity on the nose it makes up for on the palate.  It makes me want to study it more.

Finish: (4.5)  I love the finish.  It balances sweetness and spice and then fades gradually without heating you up.  It is a well conducted symphony on the finish.  It is like rocking out to your favorite song after you have dialed up the perfect EQ.

I am a big Wild Turkey admirer and not turned off by some of the ""reputation"" prejudice that the brand gets.  I will say  though that the price point is high by comparison to other Wild Turkey premiums.  I got just as much enjoyment from Russell 10 yr SiB and Rare Breed for half the bottle price.  That saying......go get you some Diamond Anniversary because now I feel a need to buy Master's Keep for a side by side comparison!"

Nose- Cinnamon and pie crust. Some Krispy Kreme donuts maybe?
Body- Russian tea notes of orange,  cinnamon, and cloves. 
Finish. Sweet tea tannins here. This is a very complex bourbon where ever sip seems to give you a little something more. The current lead bourbon in our 1068 Pubcast blind taste test! It even beat out the Four Roses limited small batch 2014... barely."

4.0,"Revisited this one tonight after bottle being open for awhile.  As much as it hurts I have to drop the rating a bit.  Not enough ""wow"" factor on the nose.  Although the palette and finish is fun and changing, it is a bit dead and misses a higher proof I think.  Finish is still pretty kick ass though.  $129 good?  Nah.  Tasty Wild Turkey with history to it-- for sure."
5.0,"Nose: Vanilla and wood.
Pallet: fruit like apricot, raspberry that turns into cherry syrup.

4.0,"Give it time in the glass.  Too be sipped over time.  DON'T put any drops of water like I did at first.  Take your time and it will mellow out.  Not overly sweet. More nuanced.  Dare I say more ""sophisticated"" bourbon?  Menthol, butterscotch, candy apples.  Getting marzipan which I assume from the higher content of barley. Hints of vanilla, leather, and nutmeg.  I assume vanilla from good casks, leather from the age, and nutmeg from the rye.  A hint of brewed tea.  All that said I really like Russells 10 year reserve because it is richer is taste and mouthfeel.  Both are good.  Both are different."

Edit: This has been open for awhile. Coming back to it this evening the fruit is more present on the nose. On the taste the barrel is very present with some bitter and woody notes. A little hint of spice follows that becomes warmth as it finishes.

Would purchase again."

4.0,"My favorite watering hole has been knocking it out of the park recently with rare Bourbon at a reasonable price! This is the latest example! 
My main takeaway is just how velvety it feels in your mouth. Very coating and viscous at 91 proof. Impressive! On the pallette it leads with vanilla and sweet tea and then quickly transitions to spice notes. Mid palatte features dried fruit notes (apricots) and leads into a long oak and tobacco driven finish. Some old leather too. Wonderful! 
Why not 5 stars you ask? Simple, while it's very good, it's not the best rare Bourbon I have had. 4-4.5/5. Definitely worth a pour or bottle if you can find it."

4.25,"Nose - black tea, cherry, apple, chalky caramel, spiced vanilla, bubble gum, dry peanut must (similar to the Beam funk, but not quite as funky), horehound, mild licorice, sweet subtle oak, light cinnamon, mild ethanol burn. 

Taste - black tea, cherry, grape, strong (but not bitter) oak notes, peanuts, licorice, black pepper, slight rye spice, caramel, sweet tobacco, dry spiced vanilla, almost nonexistent alcohol bite, finishing long and mellow with lingering, sweet and mildly tannic earthy tea flavors. 

I rarely get tea flavors with bourbon, and never this strongly before. While I generally like higher proofs bourbons better, I disagree with some of the other reviewers who indicated this would be better at a higher proof. It is wonderfully mellow; all the harsh edges have been rounded off by time. Reminds me of lounging on a big front porch on a hot summer day drinking sweet iced tea. There are bourbons whose flavor profiles I like better, but this feels perfectly balanced and masterfully engineered. However, for my money I’d rather have two bottles of ECBP."
3.75,"I won’t lie, I liked it of course but it was not in my top 5 WT elites. For my taste this only competes with some of their midrange expressions but with a heftier fee. The nose was dry with aromas of floral, aged oak and char. The palette was similar with oak leading the show. This was best as a neat pour as water/ice muddied the waters too much. I don’t regret the purchase, it was enjoyed, but I would not repeat unless 20-30 less in price."
