3.5,"Was lucky enough to pick this up at the distillery around New Year’s Eve 2018. If you’ve never been, the tour is nice and is definitely recommended  if you are a fan of Jack.

Nose: Like all Jack products there is a lot of vanilla and banana on the nose. Also there is a noticeable amount of barrel char and perhaps a bit of smoke.

Palate: At the tip of the tounge is vanilla, then banana pudding. Next comes an explosion of those barrel influences found on the nose. Think char and a heavy dose of oak.

Finish: Those char and oak notes just keep going and going and going.

With the added proof (mine was at 107) it reminded me a lot of the single barrel-barrel proof with more influence from the wood. If you’re a fan of leather/char/wood notes in your whiskey you’re sure to love this. A quality product and certainly interesting, glad I picked up a bottle.

Cheers!"

4.25,"This is very good. Far superior to regular JD old No.7.  Given its fairly young age, I was not expecting this to be as good as it is, but the high angels share definitely had an impact."
