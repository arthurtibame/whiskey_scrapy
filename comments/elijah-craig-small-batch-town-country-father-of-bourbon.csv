4.25,"Very good store pick. 
Nose: A little alcohol burn but in a good way, hints of caramel and vanilla.

Palate: full flavor. More caramel, vanilla, hint of oak on the back end. It drinks like a higher proof bourbon.

Finish: Medium finish. More oak, some baking spices.

Very well balance full of flavor, great store pick. Thanks Winos."
4.25,"Nice. This is a good barrel pick. Has a good burn due to its proof, but it isn't over powering or anything. This is is a nice find. Thank @Winos_Seattle for picking a nice barrel and pointing it out to us."
