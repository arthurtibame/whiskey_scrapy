5.0,"I picked up a bottle of this as I was looking for a “filler” bottle for an online order back before the Christmas holiday.  Seeing that it was the Christmas Edition, I figured what the heck?  This blend has been around for quite some time and they always release a special, cask strength edition each holiday season.  This batch came in at a whopping 54.1% and contained malts from Ardbeg, Bowmore, Caol Ila and (surprise, surprise) Port Ellen.  Yup, “ghosted” Port Ellen.  I know this is going to be good.

The moment I poured this into the Glencairn the room was filled with delicious BBQ’d meat and burnt hickory.  There’s no need to wait out anything when it comes to this one.  The nose is just a blazing campfire of peat, smoke and brisket.  That has to be a huge percentage of Ardbeg providing this blast furnace of smoky goodness.

The palate is incredibly luscious, while still providing some charred oak and hints of vanilla sweetness.  This is all about the peat and seaside air, though.  Make no mistake about it.  The high ABV doesn’t hinder or harm the mouthfeel at all- it just works so well and you don’t need to cool the spirit a bit.

The finish is long, meaty and just astonishing.  Smoke lingers on until you take another sip and reignite the fires.  This is an amazing blend.  I think I prefer it over CBW’s Peat Monster.  It lacks a lot of depth, but when you want that BBQ goodness- this is its wheelhouse.  4.5 stars, easily.  The $62 price tag makes it a fantastic deal.  I’m definitely going to add another bottle to any order that I need a spot filled.  Buy with confidence.  Cheers."

2.0,"my review is of the Drinks by The Dram 2017 Christmas advent calendar version, which may not be the same as this.

Not bad just tastes unfinished to me. Could use some more barrel aging, not much of wood note or color. the peat tastes almost medicinal."

5.0,big bang for your bucks. this one is good. far better than the overated lagavulin 16 in my opinion.
2.5,"Shoulder Pour
N - sugar sweet, peat, little nail polish
T - smoke, citrus, vanilla
F - ash, but very short for the high ABV

Thoughts: Bought this on sale in early Jan of '20. Sold by the price the peat and the Port...Ellen. This is the palest whiskey in my cabinet, not the end of the world, but this has to be a young whiskey. This was only worth the money and value was not jumping out of the bottle. There is a reason the bottle didn't sell for 3 subsequent Christmas seasons at original price."

4.0,"Christmas is in the air and arrives in hours. Prepped Eve meals and the house and will finalize tomorrow morning. Completed watching the South Park Christmas episodes with my son. This sample has been waiting in the wings since last year.  Now is the perfect time to take this in.  Ahh, Big Peat, what are thou liketh?

It mirrors the color of a Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio. 

During the summer, smoking ribs, turkey, chicken and pork is a simple pleasure of mine.  This nose is all Kansas City Rub on brined turkey slowly smoked with hickory.  A molasses glazing sauce drizzled about.  Garnishing the nose are caramelized apples and pears.  This only sweetens over time. A full meal realized through aromas. 

The smoke realized on the nose is captured on the palate though as blackend-charred meat.  Salted caramel and vanilla sweetness balances the charcoal that is ever present.  Salami, olive brine, canned pears, bbq pineapples and peaches accompany the flavors. 

A never ending tarry finish with hints of oak and vanilla sweetness.  Some faint  sulfur comes through at the deep backend of the finish.  The body is warmed deep within.

This one surprised me as you would expect an overdone, overblown peated scotch. But it is quite balanced with just the correct amount sweetness to keep things in check. The high abv is unnoticed and sips more of a 43% or 46% bottled whisky.  The Ardbeg and Caol Ila is clearly evident work well together.  A big thanks to @LeeEvolved for sharing this delightful whisky.  [90/100][Tasted: 12/23/18]"
