null,"** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This was the second Kavalan I tried at the festival and it had some serious, yet weird, flavors going on.  Heavy raisins and grape sweetness and it bounced around from dry to oily all during the same sample.  It left a lingering oak note on the tongue and that was the only negative aspect I recall.  I’d be interested in trying it again to give it another go.  I have a feeling the Soloist series is the highlights from Kavalan.  Maybe I’ll divert some scotch funds over to these bottles, as I think they’d make a great addition to my collection of Asian whisky.  Cheers."
null,"Review #9 of 12 from DC Whiskyfest 2018. I was only able to do 12 because I came down with something that afternoon that really messed with my head and stomach. I should have just stayed in the hotel room but I didn’t pay $350 for VIP tickets to sample my pillow!
No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

Sweet with port notes, nice but quite subtle on the nose. 

Insta-dry palate!  Sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. Oak, port, then magically became mouthwatering. 

Good but not great especially for the price."

3.0,"57.8% ABV

Cask #0090714056A | Bottle #030/184 Nose - (w/o water) Sharp syrupy sweet dried prunes/figs, dark chocolate, strawberry preserves, oaked cider (w/ water) Tiny bit less cloyingly sweet but otherwise similar.

Taste - (w/o water) Drying, yet syrupy sweet, dark dried prunes, white pepper heat, cloves & cinnamon (w/ water) Less syrupy, more balanced dark berry/stone fruit preserves, heat is greatly reduced.

Finish - (w/o water) Long lingering dark dried stone fruit syrupy sweet, light spice bitterness, mouth drying (w/ water) Still sweet but less viscous, less burn, less bitter, tiny hint of sour berry at the end.

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This one was just overall cloyingly sweet. It felt like it was dominated by a thick dried dark stone fruit syrupy sweetness like they used a wet port cask or something. It was quite one dimensional and was just purely sweet until the addition of a tiny bit of water which in this case greatly helps it out. Sadly the tropical/floral notes I get in their other offerings is completely hidden by the port and therefore makes this quite one dimensional in a bad way. I think based on what barrel/bottle you get, you'll need to add a tiny bit of water to get it to taste not like a super strong port. On another note, at the very very end of the finish, a tiny bit of dark chocolate notes do appear making it feel like a dark chocolate dipped dried dark stone fruits. This definitely feels like a dessert dram."

4.75,One of the best whisky profile I have ever tested. If Glen Moray's port is 2/10 in terms of full body. This will be 10/10. So complex just by smelling it. Port is in your face type but I love it.
3.5,"Tried the green label version. Cask o090629022a. Super super rich. Lots of meaty flavor up front with a meaty salty nose. Clove, cinnamon"

4.25,"It’s Friday night which means one thing.  Actually means a lot of things.  Like checking my oldest’s homework that I assign her for the week (yes.  That’s right...I assign her my own math, science and reading because our public schools teach at the lowest common denominator.  Which doesn’t help when your kid will need to compete with those bright kids from India, Singapore, China, Norway, Finland, and pretty much 50 other countries with better public schools than ours).  Friday night also means sitting back and watching Netflix.  Today...season 3 of that ball busting, ass kicking, whiskey drinking hottie Jessica Jones.  

But most importantly, Friday night means I get to sit back and enjoy a pour.    Now, watching Jessica Jones, one must strategically choose the right drink.   Some pansy ass rose’ just won’t do.  You need something stronger.  So...was deciding between a pour of Booker’s Kentucky Chew, Elijah Craig Barrel Strength, or a Kavalan Solist Port cask.  We’ll go with a pour of this Taiwanese beauty.  It’s matured fully in port casks in the hot (but not as hot as Amrut’s Bangalore ) climate of Southeast Asia.  It’s gotta be first fill.  The color is dark, like that Crayola burnt sienna.  Nose is amazing; sweet clotted cream and strawberries.  The nose alone is 5 stars.  The taste is down a notch, but still carries a sweet berry and burnt sugar taste.  Really oily and viscous...I guess that 55+% ABV does that.  I paid about $10 for a pour, but I think the full bottles are close to $300.  Not sure I’d pay that much, but if you can find a pour, it’s really well worth it.  You won’t be disappointed.  

Oh...and Jessica Jones has upgraded from Tincup whiskey to Michter’s...a respectable notch up."

4.5,"Cask O 090626016A Bottle 160/174 
57.8%
Full Nose with dark flavors, raisins and apricots. Vanilla and cinnamon spices. Strong Alcohol in the mouth but dark flavors dominate, those dried fruity and spice characters. these are well balanced with woody earthy flavors. The finish is strong and lingers. There is some sweetness after the alcohol fades, hints of vanilla and cinnamon. I need to get another bottle of this."
3.5,Very long aftertaste
5.0,"Cask O090911037A. Aged 8 years 6 months, this is the oldest Kavalan I’ve ever tried. Full of flavors such as chocolate, caramel, plums, raisins, dates, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, citrus, mangoes, Passion Fruit, Kiwis, Watermelons, and hints of spices."

5.0,"Got a sample of this from whiskysite.nl. Cask O100505024A. 7 years old. This is great stuff with notes of strawberries, raspberries, chocolate, spice, a little passion fruit and toffee. Medium finish than can be longer with a nice raspberry chocolatey feel."
3.75,"Tried this one straight up and was impressed how easily it went down. The taste included notes of prunes, burnt caramel, brown sugar and over the top of it all was a quite strong flavour of molasses. As Lee mentioned it's definitely a weird taste. It's constructed very well this drop but the flavour profile isn't for me as it's a bit odd..similar to east asian desserts which often have weird sweet flavours e.g. sweet bean curd. It's a hard one to rate, quality and balance high, flavour profile fair bit lower. 3.75 - 4 I think.  It's not one I'd drink a lot of. This is the third Kavalan I've had and over all they are a quality drop but not really a distillery that grabs me flavour wise."
