4.0,"Edradour has blown my mind in the past months, and i am starting to develop fond feelings for this ""scottish little gem"". Caledonia 12yo is one of their  expressions, a heavily sherried one (as all the others) but this can prove to be a challenge to some beginners. 

Bottled at 46.5%abv, super reddish deep copper color. 

On the nose: Orange caramel, maraschino cherry syrup; Red fruits, strawberry syrup .
Super sweet but a little dim. Alcohol note is powerful. Glazed pork notes also appear. Actually the nose was not that great.

On the palate it was delicious. Coffee, Sweet syrup, Sherried. 
This is a nice Spicy little fellow. 

Aftertaste is an atomic spice bomb. The most absolute spiciness there is. Ashes, clove, pepper and cinnamon. 

Overall i really enjoyed this and the score might not reflect what it really is. 86/100. Sláinte!"
4.25,"Nose: medium intensity, moderate age, light smoke with leather, wood, and brine

Flavor: salty, umami, full body"

4.0,"Much better than their standard 10 year old.  They usually are all over the place making wood experimentation as the norm, without a real house flavor like you'd find in most distillers, but this one really stood out.  UPDATE 2/26:  Had a fresh sample from a newly opened bottle.  Nice distinctly sherry profile, but not as deep or complex as a Glendronach or Macallan.  Lighter, fresher.  Still getting the typical profile though of yellow raisins, dry fruit...just not as deep.  Worthwhile purchase for a gentler, milder sherry cask whisky."

3.5,"Nose: Dark sweet honey combined with dry sherry - very dry and nutty. There's also a savoury, almost meaty or leathery edge that's quite interesting. A hint of engine oil and something sharp - menthol? Mint? I get the figs and soy sauce that Stephanie Moreno notes, but not the orange marmalade - it's more like grapefruit or sour lemon to me. Deep down there's some oak.

Palate: A moderate delivery that you think is going to be sweet, but suddenly turns most confusingly savoury and then salty in the development. Quite odd. I didn't get much in the way of berry or fruity notes - maybe some sultanas in a savory sauce. Toasted almonds, roasted chestnuts. Hmm, a touch of licorice and citrus zest.

Finish: Long, dry and spicy, finishing on over-brewed tea, a savory-sweet licorice note and a spice I can't quite identify.

I'm partial to a challenging whiskies but initially but this one seemed just too odd, however once you acquire the taste the meaty-earthy sherried character that is quirky at first glance becomes quite enjoyable. It's certainly not your average sherry-bomb.

For a young whisky this also emphatically needs time to wake up and flex its muscles - 15 minutes at least. It's not an immediately forceful nose but once it gets going it commands attention with its unusual but gentle complexity.

It's a most surprising malt, maybe not one I'd turn to every day, but interesting, which is never a bad thing. The nose is still developing in the glencairn after 30 minutes, with oak coming more and more to the front. Adding a dash of water sweetens everything to match and ramps up the spices as well.

I enjoyed the bottle I had and was glad to be able to spend some time with it and get to know the whisky as it changed over a few months. It was an interesting dram but I don't think I'd bother buying it again.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

4.0,"Got to try this at a whisky expo. This is a three and a half for me. I think it's because I feel that it suffers from a bit of an identity crisis at first. I really had to work to get those floral notes, which I respect but didn't enjoy too much. The woody and spicy notes are nice, but I think I'd rather have an Aberlour 18 or A'bunadh. I do have to say I dug the light citrus, but the finish was a little dry for me. Overall, I've had worse, but I have had better. I wouldn't mind trying an older expression, that's for sure."

4.0,"It's a little subdued on first nosing, and that's never a great thing, but with enough patience floral notes rise out of the whisky coupled with honey. The palate, on the other hand, is almost ecstasy: orange rind, barley and mint coming together harmoniously. It's actually quite spectacular. The finish is great, with a touch of oak and a dry mouthfeel. I don't know that I would buy this, but I would definitely gift it."

4.0,"So, I'm finally trying to get myself back into our Scottish Distillery Tour.  I'm down to the final 3 samples provided by other members in the group as the shipping date for our second round rapidly approaches.  This is the second of 3 from my friend Pranay.  Edradour Caledonia 12 year old.  It's 46% ABV and from the Highland region.  It's non-chill filtered and has no color added.

On the nose there's tons of fruit from the Oloroso sherry cask and a nice blast of cinnamon and oak from the bourbon cask.  They're all there and mingle quite nicely.  A refreshing burst of heat greets your tongue along with cinnamon and oak.  The finish is longer than I expected and was just hot enough to put a smile on my face.  This was a great way to bring me back to the SDT.  3.75 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,"An initially shy nose awakens to delicious aromas of stewed fruit after some vigorous  agitation (2/3). On the palette, there are rich, melting caramel flavors with a satisfying undertone of tannic Assam tea (2/3). The peppery finish lingers long enough to make you want to close your eyes and savor it. (2/3). Bonus point: 1/1 for the lovely color and viscosity. Total: 7/10. Many thanks to Pranay for the generous sample that introduced me to a distillery I would happily revisit."
3.0,"Another end to a weekend finds me watching some March Madness basketball.  Perfect time for a dram and watch the drama and action unfold. 

Eradour Calendonia pours out in the glass as a rust colored liquid.  By a purely visual observation, you would be in err to think that this was unnaturally colored and chilled filtered (this is the natural color and is NCF).  The initial nose is floral and citrus with heather, orange rind, peaches.  Over time, a malty and sucrose sweetness are detected along with some tea and honey notes.  A bit of saddle leather lurks in the depths.  I have said before, when nosing, I envision where a dram takes me.  I find myself on that first warm spring day where you know the winter is well behind (unfortunately, this spring, not yet!).  Arrives in a light and thin body with brown sugar and mixed nuts. Mostly sweet but tempered somewhat.  Oddly, cola flavors come forward after some time in the glass.  The cola could be considered or on par with the maple syrup flavor that others have experienced.  A zing of black pepper and ginger root spice as this fades to a finish.  The sweetness and cola flavors strenthen over time.  A long and simple finish of orange bitters, caramel and a touch of ginger and oak.  Thanks Pranay for the sample.

This is a sweet whisky that evolves to an even sweeter one.  The oddity of cola, for me, made this slightly unique.  Not a flashy whisky or one that pushes boundries.  Stays sweet and enjoyable.  Somewhat akin, for me, to Balvenie.  [Dry Glass: Salted Caramels][86/100][Tasted: 3/19/17]"
4.0,"Stop number 7 on the SDT is Edradour. They use the smallest stills allowed by law in Scotland (according to an article I read recently) which helps produce a whisky with strong character. This Highland single malt is matured in Olorsoso sherry casks. It weighs in at 46% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of burnt sienna. 

On the nose I was greeted with a blast of sweet floral honey. The sherry kicks in pretty quickly with berries and plums. Light oaky notes. Savory toffee and caramel. There is a faint bourbony mint, and speaking of bourbon I could easily be fooled into believing this was a scotch/ bourbon blend. There are definite bourbon like flavors hidden away here if you hunt for them. After sitting in the glass there is a nice light maple syrup to round things out. 

There is a burst of pepper on the tongue on the first sip that was surprising given how sweet the nose is. More berries and plums and sherried fruits. Honey and oak and more pepper. 

Medium bodied and very mouthwatering. A fairly long finish for a sherried scotch. The mouthwatering feel continues on with considerable length. Sweet with dry oak and spice. 

This being my first Edradour I didn't know what to expect. I have to say I'm quite impressed. Perfect level of sweetness for me and enough spice to balance it out. The natural presentation is always appreciated. I believe this bottle goes for around $50 and I feel that's a great price for this quality. I just read an article that Edradour is expanding which is good news for all. Thank you Pranay for the sample. Cheers"

4.25,"Nez: riche et profond. cuir, oranges et panier de petit fruits frais. gomme baloune, canelle et bois humide. belle amalgame d'arômes de fruits
palais : Entré en bouche remplie d'épices, de cannelle, gingembre et muscade. le développement ce passe dans les fruits cuits, amertume de cacao, bananes mûres, avoines et quelques pointes de cerises au masquarin et d'agrumes. Il est complexe, bien balancé et l'alcool mord à peine. texture moelleuse et agréable.
finale longue, astringente et savoureuse presque humami. 

un sherry finish complexe et savoureux"

Attaque très douce menant à une superbe rondeur. On sent encore le fruit confit et le caramel, c'est beau.
La finale est agréable et longue dans la bouche, chaleureuse, avec un pruneau toujours présent.
un superbe whisky de dessert, tout en rondeur."

5.0,"I love this whiskey. Edradour is one of my favorite distilleries, and this this malt doesn't let me down. The nose is thick with dried fruits. Plum, apricot, raisin. A sweet nuttiness, like pecan praline. Oranges, and caramel. I also get hints of a spicy tobacco in the background. Light earthy peat rounds the nose out nicely. The palate follows the nose, but heavier on the spices. Cinnamon, clove, and licorice. The peat presents as a light leathery note, followed by earthiness. This is a dense malt, and there is much to explore. It's extraordinarily tasty, so I don't mind taking the time to do so."
