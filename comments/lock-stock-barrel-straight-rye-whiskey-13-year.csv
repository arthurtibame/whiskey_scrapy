4.0,"It has that great bready nose that I love from complex ryes, but it's surprisingly ""thin"" on first sip. That's not to say it not enjoyable by any means, but the higher-aged Willetts are more what I'm looking for. Without taking price into consideration, this is a great rye."

2.0,Unfortunately didn't love it. Great spicy nose but all I tasted was pepper without balance or anything else to round it out.

3.0,"Nose: spicy, apple pie, vanilla.  
Palate: somewhat full body, spicy, vanilla, but finish is tannic.  Not terribly balanced on the flavors.  After being in a glencairn for awhile the finish mellows to almost nothing.    
Overall- it is not a bad rye, I like the age, nose and initial mouthfeel.  It is not one of my favorites and I would not spend $120 retail on this.  3 - 3.5 / 5"

4.0,"Found this at a local watering hole (Overtime in Lombard, IL.) that has a fantastic bourbon selection.  Nose has a medicinal value due to the intense rye, grains, cheerios, floral, slight sweet.  Palate of nutmeg and other cooking spices, cherry cough drops, rye dough, young un-ripened berries.  Mouth feel coats the entire mouth with a slight oil and a lovely oil numbing.  If you're a rye lover do not pass this up.  Keep drinking my friends... Skol"

5.0,"This is impeccable. This rye doesn't kick too much or weigh you down. It seemed pretty clean and balanced. It seemed dryer or maybe slightly smoky? It was such a different taste then I normally expect from a rye I has trouble making out some of the complexities! Bravo, Lock, Stock, and Barrel-- you are a lovely rye."

5.0,This tastes a lot like Whistle Pig but has the strong rye finish the standard WP lacks. A lot of people really don't like this though. I would strongly recommend trying at a bar before you buy.

4.5,"Arguably one of, if not the, best rye I’ve had to date. 

Mellow heat throughout but tons of flavor with a finish that just keeps on giving. 

The price is the only set back like others stated. If you can try it do yourself a favor and go for it"

3.5: Very good. I might buy again
