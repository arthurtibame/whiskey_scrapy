Realized I had rated this some time back, but had never properly reviewed it. Time to rectify the oversight.

*NOSE: Sweet Buttercream Icing. Dry Wheat/Whole Grain Toast. Fruity Pebbles Cereal. Powdred Sugar Coated Lemon Bars. Slightly Vegetal.
*NEAT: The nose transfers surprisingly well to the palate. Fruity Pebbles. Malt Grain. Dry Wheat/Whole Grain Toast. Agave. Black Pepper. Drying Finish with a Sweet and Peppery Coating.

*VERDICT: Unique Mashbill with Malted Barley and Wheat, served up at 100proof. Surprisingly sweet. Great from the freezer or over ice. Subs well as a riff on recipes calling for Silver Tequila, Rum or Vodka. Pairs well with Tonic or just a splash of Club Soda. I actually have this rated higher than it's aged version, Quinn's (though I think if the Quinn's were aged a little longer it would be equally enjoyable to this one)."
4.5,"What a unique find! I find this very pleasant and fruity, with a lot of the barley notes coming forward. My brother hates it, but I find it quite delicious."
3.0,Raw.  The type of moonshine I’d buy.
