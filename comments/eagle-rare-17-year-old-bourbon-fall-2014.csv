4.0,Starts off a little hot but finishes with a ton of flavor.  Very good classic bourbon.

5.0,"Found a great bourbon bar at Chimes in Covington, LA. Best selection I've seen yet. Had a pour of this hard to find bourbon and enjoyed every sip. Great vanilla nose with a hint of char and oak. The mouth feel was thin, although the pallet was what you would expect from a premium bourbon. Sweet on the tip of the tung with vanilla and oak and finishing with a long satisfying spicy burn. Paid $26."
4.0,I wish I was less of a novice when I tried this a few years ago. I want to try it again and hopefully appreciate it more. What I recall is that it was an exceptional bourbon that screamed of cinnamon and spice. I think a splash of water was necessary to take the heat away though.

3.0,Lovely vanilla and lemon peel aromas and typically robust Bourbon flavors of honey and caramel. Not particularly complex for the price but a lovely nose.

4.0,"Sweet. Brown sugar. Toasted marshmallow. 

A fine bourbon. 


To be honest, I just tried a sip of a friends after I had finished too many Scotches. Probably not fair to judge a fine whiskey like this when I’m drunk. So take this for what it is."

4.5,"We tasted the 2013 Eagle Rare ""Uncut"". At above 117 proof it had notes of sweet molasses. Almost like chewing on Raw brown sugar, except that it was a liquid. Long ever-changing finish."

5.0,Incredibly smooth almost 0 burn. Upfront it seems almost like a normal bourbon. Middle palate is where the flavor develops. A great deal of aromatic flavors. After I swallow the taste lingers for a very long time complex caramels toffee’s and a hint of plum
4.0,"Was fortunate enough to get 3 oz for 49.65 Euros, a relative steal compared to what it would cost PER OUNCE in the US by the bottle. 
With that said I personally would not pay the 900.00 secondary pricing for a ER 17
The nose is refined caramel & vanilla , nothing really jumps out 
The palate is oak 
The finish i am not loving nor hatin
Not really complex enough for me
I still give it a 4 out of appreciation for it being 17 year age stated BTAC and the privilege to drink it. 
I however prefer the other 4 BTAC bottles generically irrespective of year & luckily the WLW, GTS & THH are not so hard to come by one way or another, and i would rate each of the other BTAC's all higher
Cheers!!!"
