3.75,"Ripe fruits & raisins on the nose, warming fiery mouth with citrus, light peat and hints of salt."
3.0,"Very peaty, opens up a little with water but retains a strong smoky profile. The peat covers most other flavors but if you like smoke it's a pleasant finish"

3.75,"Wolfburn tasting at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, May 30th 2019: Whisky #3

Nose: A very mild, almost shy and retiring peat-reek that dances around a delicious fruity-floral distillate. Pineapple, tangerine, peach and apricot nectar, but in a subtle and dilute form. The initial nosing is dominated by fruit and a touch of vanilla, but over time as the whisky rests and opens in the glass smoke becomes more and more apparent. It's a simple nose but the balance between the two key components is masterful, and compelling.

Palate: A much sweeter and richer arrival than either the Northland or Aurora expressions. The peat smoke is stronger on the palate than it is on the nose and the tasting notes are reversed - the smoke arrives first and then in the development the fruity and sweet notes emerge. There is a little hint of brine and the spicy kick in the development that is characteristic of young Wolfburn is here much less spiky and bright - more sweet chili sauce and ginger in syrup than black and white pepper. Raisin and sweet malt make an appearance and the texture is well balanced - just slightly on the creamy side of neutral.

Finish: Medium/long. The spicy and smoke characteristics die away slowly leaving a pleasant aftertaste.

An impressive whisky produced using very lightly peated malt (<10ppm) and matured in a combination of 1st-fill and refill bourbon barrels and refill American oak quarter casks.  The most remarkable thing I noticed about this malt was its sweetness - I could easily have believed that there was a sherry cask making a small contribution, but no - it's 100% bourbon. However this sweetness is perfectly matched by a dry briny note that prevents it from becoming cloying.

It is absolutely not a peat monster, and the peat-reek is unlike any Islay. It's gentle, seductive and fragrant - much more like Speyside smoke - and it acts as an ingredient rather than the primary facet on the nose, before becoming assertive on the palate, at just the right time.

This was one of the two most popular whiskies of the tasting. I enjoyed it enough to buy a bottle.

""Good, just a whisker short of Very Good"" : 3.75 stars"

3.25,"smooth, a little smoky, peaty, with a sweetness."
3.5,"Summerton Virtual Whisky Festival sample.

First off, this is an extremely easy whisky to drink.  There’s a little peat in there (10ppm) and some coastal saltiness.

It doesn’t have the wilder tastes of some of the Islay heavy hitters, but they have used some ex-Laphroaig Quarter Casks and you can certainly taste it throughout.

The finish on this one brings out more smoke, some spiciness and an aftertaste of ginger and chilli that stays for ages.  Another delicious dram from Wolfburn."
2.5,"Лёгкий торф и дым. Ещё какая-то не очень приятная маслянистость. Нормально, но ещё раз бы я не взял"

1.75,"This one is not much better then its sibling “Northland”. The peat gives it some character but sadly enough I don’t get much more except the peat and the light fruitiness of the base “Northland”. Sadly the peat also is not very pleasant and feels misplaced. It really needs some age, that might help it."

3.5,"Nose: A fairly faint hint of smoke. Apple? Grapes?

Flavour: Gentle smoke/peat flavour. Slight spice. 

Finish: Stays with you for a fair amount of time, with a hint of both spice and smoke."
