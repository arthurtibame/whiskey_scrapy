3.75,"So I must preface this review by saying that when I opened the bottle and took the first taste, all I could think of was how I was going to slam this in my review. It smelled like tea, and tasted like tea, tobacco, and leather. But a funny thing happened as I tasted it during pours and even more so as the bottle reached the halfway point; it morphed into something else and a host of new flavors came out. I have never had a whiskey change this dramatically after first tasting. That said, on to the review:

Nose: Tea, tobacco, and leather (lol) Ok but seriously, in addition to that there's unsweetened chocolate, vinegar, root beer, musty rickhouse, and a savory soy sauce note. 

Palate is a pretty punchy blast of candied orange, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and hazelnut.  Oh also tea, tobacco, and leather. :)  Definitely on the tannic side, but with a surprising amount of complexity which increases with each sip. 

Finish is pretty short with cinnamon, clove, and menthol. More candied orange when that fades. Mouthfeel is light bodied but fits the profile and proof well.

So after thinking I was going to slam the shit out of this, here I am giving it a decent review. I found myself repeatedly coming back to this over and over again to analyze it, and will be sad to see the almost empty bottle go. A weird bird, but at $35 a weird bird worth having around and I will almost certainly buy another bottle."

Palate: Chocolate chip banana bread to a tee

Easy sipper and nice change of pace"

Hard to explain, but if you’re in the mood for bourbon, then just go get a bourbon..... this really is different and not something I will buy again."

4.0,"On the nose you get distinct notes of honey, toffee, and barley. Rather bright nose with a hint of maple. On the front of the tongue you get some spice and heat with touches of woodiness that follow on to the finish. Buttery transition into mid mouth with a mouthfeel that’s reminiscent of several highland malts made on shorter alembic stills. Starting light and finishing rather dense on the mouthfeel side of things. As you get to the finish, there begins to be a bit of slipperiness on the front of the tongue and you start to perceive the rye in the grain build. Tobacco, malt, rye, and vanilla are all notes you can pick up on a nice finish. Rather impressive for an American malt and certainly worth a pour."

5.0,This bourbon has become a nightly pour for me. Undeniably smooth with notes of caramel and vanilla on the nose. Oak notes on the palate as well as semi sweet chocolate that shines through to the finish with those familiar highland whisky flavors peeking through at the end. Easily my favorite Woodford product to date

4.0,"On the nose there is sweet corn, lots of pleasant malty and cereal notes and a solid showing of oak and vanilla. The palate morphs along the way, crazy! Chocolates, mild vanilla, some baking spices and hint of classic bourbon notes and ends with a hit of cinnamon. The rye feels heavier than 2%. Mouth feel isn't too heavy. Finish is short and leaves something to be desired. Overall, my favorite Woodford offering! Their bourbon hasn't been great the past few years in my opinion, but this is awesome! It'd be a perfect bridge for people interested in traveling/dabbling between bourbon and scotch! Instantly a new favorite!"

4.0,"When I uncorked this bottle, I was quickly hit with malt and tea leaves. (Not really something I want to smell in a whiskey.) It took some time to find those classic bourbon notes. (Vanilla, honey, caramel).

I gave it a week to open up before I tasted it again. On the nose, I got buttery caramel, a little vanilla, honey, and some oak spice. Those sweet flavors fell onto the palate, along with some dark chocolate bitterness, cinnamon candies, barrel char, and dark fruits. Amazing flavors, smooth entry, and a warm, spicy finish! I’d say this is for bourbon drinkers who want something a tad lighter. This malt is like a fine wine, MUCH better in time! Definitely one to be enjoyed, neat; NO WATER NECESSARY! Good job, Woodford!!!!!!!"

All in all very impressed and very good for the money.. $35.00 local. Worth a Try for sure. I might always have a bottle of this on my shelf."
2.75,"Look: Burnt dark orange, with plenty of lacing on the glass. 

Nose: The nose is really strong on this one, almost exclusively vanilla. 

Taste: The vanilla is there, but there’s much more oak and barrel coming through than the nose would make you think. Some cinnamon pops up as well. 

Finish: There is a good amount of heat on this bourbon, with a hot finish and lingering wood notes. Butter tannins really come through

Overall: By no means a bad whiskey, but not my favorite offering. If you love vanilla and oak, this is for you."

null,"In comparison to EH Taylor 4 Grain - (yes internet, I know this doesn’t contain wheat) - i think this takes the cake. A. It’s cheaper. 
B. It’s attainable. C. It tastes far more interesting. 

IMO the barley element is nicely integrated - it hugs the other grains rather than sits beside them in your mouth like a 3rd or 4th wheel like EH. The smell is fantastic and I’d take this over regular woodford neat any day. My only complaint is the sweetness- it’s a tad candy esq - but if you’re in the bourbon mood as a scotch drinker, or just want to share a nice pour with less whisky snobbish friends - this is a great buy. 👍🏼"

Taste - Everything promised on the nose comes through on the palate. Definitely on the sweeter side, but there's enough going on to keep it from being one-note. Vanilla and oak continue on the somewhat short finish."
3.0,"This is the best thing Woodford put out, period. It tastes like a wheated bourbon without the cereal notes. If you like Weller, Rebel or Larceny you will like this. I get no single malt notes. It is on the sweeter side, so if you like spice pass on this one. 3.5/5"

4.5,"On the nose, the first thing that this whiskey tells me is to not forget that just because it’s mostly malt, it’s still American. The classic American sweetness and wood notes hit you in the nose. But, one thing you do remember is that this isn’t bourbon. It has a lighter and fruitier nose. Banana is the prominent fruit in this whiskey that jumps out at me. This whiskey is very smooth. The wood notes attack at first, but they give way to beautiful floral notes. It’s like eating a banana in a flower garden. I’m a big fan of Scotch and you can sense some of the note similarities because of the malted barley. For people who want something different and can’t decide between scotch and bourbon, go for this and you won’t be disappointed."

3.5,"Nose: cherry and vanilla with sweet red candies and caramel.  Nuts come through but I was eating peanuts so I’m not sure. Red licorice. 

Body: light. I wonder if my bottle being over 5yrs old might adversely effect taste but body wise was thin and smooth. 

Palate: oak, vanilla, toffee

Finish: not long more nuts and light caramel and toffee. 

Note: it’s light, very mildly spicy, thin and perhaps watery. Flavors I fear are a little washed out perhaps from the bottle being old. Still it’s good but I want a new bottle to try again."

4.0,"WOODFORD RESERVE STRAIGHT MALT
APPEARANCE: Put to the light, it's a nice shade of dried tobacco. A quick swirl makes slow forming and slow moving fat droplets.
NOSE: Whoa! That Brown Foreman fresh Latex Paint note jumps right out of the glass, but it fades quickly. I get Smoky/Toasty Malt Notes of Dark Chocolate, Raw Almonds,  and Coffee. There is also Black Pepper, Clove, and the smell of Fresh Cut Lumber. (Side note: I only got the Latex Paint note on the first pour)
NEAT: Slightly Oily/Coating Mouthfeel. Lots of Oak here, but the toasted Malt Notes dominate yielding hints of an Extra-Hoppy Beer, with bolder notes of Cashews, Dark Chocolate, Unsweetened Toasted Coconut, Dried Cherries, and Burnt Sugar. A drying finish with Slightly Bitter Oak and Malt coating the palate. 
SPLASH: Gives the nose and palate a a dominant note of Tea Leaves. Reduces the Bitter Oak and adds a mint note. Am I also picking up some Honey Butter?
VERDICT: I am not a huge fan of Woodford in general, but I do applaud their willingness to go out on a limb and try new/different things. Some, like this one, work for me. Others? Well more on that in a future review. I think this is priced just right at $35 ($5 less than their bourbon sells for here). I have liked each successive pour more than the last. It definitely will be a repeat buy."
3.5,"Definitely an interesting whiskey.
The nose is a bit musty with, vanilla, oak, and spice.  The palate has cocoa, oak, nuts, and lots of malt.  The finish is not overly long with more nuts and dry wood.

All in all, this whiskey is on the drier side, probably due to being malt instead corn based."
