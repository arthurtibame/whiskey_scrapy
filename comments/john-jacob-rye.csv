4.0,"By Day Four of a 6-day cruise, I was getting ""scotched out"". The cruise ship bars stocked a number of scotch whiskies and I was trying them all. In need of a change up, I asked for a rye with two ice cubes. This is what they poured for me. And a fine rye whiskey it was! It had a slight sweetness followed by wonderful barrel notes of vanilla, caramel and oak. I was very happy to leave the scotch behind and finish the cruise with my new found rye. Now if I can only find it here in Maryland."
