3.75,"Haven't noticed the ice wine.
Tropical fruits, short finish."
4.5,"As far as experiments go, this is one that fits that profile. A wonderful expression from Glenfiddich, this is the #3 experiment (i have reviewed the IPA cask one, the #1, and soon i will be reviewing the #2).

Bottled at 43%abv, amber color.

On the nose is so beautiful. Red y purple fruits, impalpable sugar, fresh aroma that resembles a cold weather (really), very sweet sherry like those very sweet red wines, strawberry juice.

On the palate, spicyness dance with sweet grape notes, blackberry juice, a dim smoke on the back, very pleasant and fancy, hints of clove can be found on the palate.  The aftertaste is a little short, with ginger notes and plain water; it is the only sad part of it. 

Overall this is a lovely dram that could be better, but still a solid 92 over 100. Slainte!

Almost forgot! This one has a 21yo age statement."
4.0,Dramfest day 2 dram 2. Now i've had batch 1 and enjoyed it..what about batch 2? Well either they made it sweeter or my palate has changed..probably the later but very very sweet. Not my cup of tea these days but still a quality dram unlike batch 2 of the XX project
4.25,"Had a harsher initial burn than I expected, but it generally had a smooth finish."

4.0,"The nose is VERY complex, with pear, honey, vanilla notes coming forward. you notice the sweetness from the ice wine barrels immediately, but then malt and spicy elements arrive to produce a warm, lingering finish with a buttery quality. A different, interesting and delicious addition."
1.0,"Nose...fresh green apple, sweet and tart.  The wine influence shows here. There is something else on the nose it’s hard to describe, until you taste it.  Burnt rubber.  Awful, hardly palatable burnt rubber.  In my opinion this is not a good Scotch.  On the palate it’s just not pleasant at all and the finish is, thankfully, extremely short.  The only positive is that the experience is over quickly.   1/5. I would recommend Glenmorangie 18, Old Pulteney 21 or even the Hibiki Harmony over this if you want a fruity experience."

5.0,"This is absolutely delicious! Luscious is the the best adjective to describe this for sure. The sweet icewine up front, tropical notes in the middle, all fading into a smokey burn on the back end. A stellar pour! If you see this, buy it!!!"

4.25,"Nose - Sweet, lightly fruity oak, barrel aged sweet white wine is very evident, hints of elderflower/lychee, fruity caramel.

Taste - Sweet fruit/floral, light bittersweet apple cores/stems, dark lychee syrup, white pepper tingle, light musty sweet grapes.

Finish - Lingering sweet, light musty oak, white pepper tingle, light sweet fruity sour

Score - 89/100

Final Thoughts - This is quite the interesting dram. On the nose & throughout the palate, there's this light dark fruity funk that you only get with older Scotch that's always present. The sweet musty white wine funk you get is very evident and I think that they had to water it down to 43% otherwise I think it might have been a bit overpowering. That being said, for 43% it is very full flavored and not overly sweet. Not super complex but very tasty.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not another"

4.25,"Nose has the sweet notes of an ice wine.

Taste has spices with the same Ice Wine sweetness from the nose. Finishes with moderate burn."

5.0,"Our last night in Costa Rica, and I treated myself to this during a nice last night vacation dinner.  After three locations in CR ( mountains and valleys of  Monteverde, volcano and rainforests of Arenal, and sheer luxury of the Guanacaste coast), I thought this was an apt way to part.  Honestly, I was surprised to see this on the hotel shelf...not readily available in the US, never mind here in Costa Rica.  At about $30/pour...expensive.  But unique.  I’m generally not a Fiddich fan, but this was interesting.  It’s like walking into an Asian tropical fruit section.  Aromas of lychees, jackfruit, kiwi.  Palette is more of the same.  Definitely worth trying...especially if you enjoy higher quality Irish whiskey (think Bushmill 21, Redbreast 21).  You’ll get a similar tropical fruit basket, but with an Asian bent."
4.0,"I can understand some of the negative comments about this whisky. It’s expensive, hard to find, and very different from just about everything else out there. I rounded up to give it a 4⭐️. The tasting not about lychee is right on. For me, in fact, I felt like I was taking a walk through the fruit section of an Asian market. Jackfruit, star fruit, and others all made an appearance to accompany the lychee. Worth trying."

T - 86: Slight smoke, not as sweet as first thought due to icewine cask. 

F - 85: Mildly long. Lingering alcohol taste.

4.25,"The more I drink whiskey the more I firmly believe for a newly opened bottle or sample you really need to let it sit for a while and see the difference a few drops of water makes. Doesn't always make a difference but often you find it really opens a dram and brings it up a few notches. This is one such experience, the slightly off wooden notes faded and the lovely fruity flavours, lychee etc came to the fore. Lovely drop but wouldn't pay the asking price for a full bottle that's for sure! Batch 1 I had... judging on past GF results subsequent batches will be a step down in quality."
4.5,Tastes like the 18 with a hint of extra sweetness and fruit from the ice wine cask. It’s nice to have but the 18 is definitely a better value. 94

Trop cher!
On a eu la surprise d'avoir le fond d'un verre de ce whisky. Le seul point fort de cette dégustation. On a juste trempé nos lèvres, littéralement, dans ce scotch. C'est d'une douceur velouté, mais pour 350$, je vais passer mon tour. Bonne soirée, moi je quitte pour Minneapolis!"

3.75,"tasted twice from sample from friend. first nose was sweet, but kind of soapy sweet. not very pleasant. palate equaled the nose. tried it again a few days later (i rinsed out my glass to make sure it was clean).  the nose has brightened & cleaned up.  palate has plenty of ice wine sweetness. it’s the sweetest scotch i’ve ever had. overall it fits my sweet tooth profile, but i'm glad i didn't spend $300 on it."
