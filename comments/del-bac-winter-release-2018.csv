3.75,"Available only once a year, Winter Release is unique and fleeting, with this year’s limited run producing less than 1,000 bottles. 2018 Winter Release is a blend of barrels that includes Whiskey Del Bac finished in ex-bourbon casks, as well as barrels from Tucson’s Iron John’s Brewing Company that held sherry barleywine. 

Nose: Honey BBQ, smoked meat, mint, pipe tobacco, 

Taste: Sweet, savory, and hot. Pipe tobacco.
 Once again like biting into a dry rubbed meat. 

Experience: a litteral Barbecue. What else can I say? sweet, meaty, and spiced."
