3.5,"Distilled December 12, 2000.  Bottled August 2013 at 55.8% ABV.  Cask no. 149.  288 bottles released.

Craigellachie is one of my favorite distilleries.  It is full, fearless, and funky like Springbank.  This indie reminds me of Springbank 12 CS.  Rich honey, bright fruits, and funky sherry.  Craigellachie and Springbank are two distilleries that produce spirit with a little sulfur, so it can mask a little sulfur from suboptimal sherry casks that would ruin other whiskies.

Despite the back of this bottle reading “This cask is full of American Oak influence with creamy-vanilla and sweet oak,” I am surprised how much sherriness I pick up.  It is sweetly floral and full of berries and raisin.  And for the protein, there is honey and redcurrant jelly braised beef stew.  Savory, and a little stinky without water.  This is a fulfilling meal that is holding in a fart.

My complaint is if you add water.  This dram will fart.  Sulfur will divide by zero.  Matchsticks, if you want to be polite about it.  Putrid flesh, if you want to be overdramatic and mean about it.  There’s citrus on the finish, which is timely.

I prefer the Craigellachie 13 original bottling, which is widely available and cheaper.  However, this was definitely a characterful and unforgettable bottle.  This was my first Creative Whisky Company purchase, and I will be looking for more expressions if the distillery and the price are right.

Score: * (unforgettably good)
How much does a bottle cost: $80-120
