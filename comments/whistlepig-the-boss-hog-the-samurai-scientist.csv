4.5,Spice hits hard in the beginning. The proof is legit and heat is certain.

4.75,"Deep Amber in color 
Aroma dark caramel, Rye spice in the second row, but very present. Very floral and lots of dark fruit. 
Flavor, great blend of deep caramel infused with black pepper, cinnamon & a touch of clove. Finish is awesome and warming. This does NOT drink like 120 proof. Wow. Dark bready notes with complexity due to the spice notes.  Really enjoying this. Somewhat oily and vanilla continues to emerge as glass opens.  Found this at an airport restaurant and could not believe it.  Let's just say that I was pleased."
4.75,"Nose- Traditional rye spice; crystalized ginger; plums; wet oak; orange citrus; creamy vanilla

Palate- Wave of oranges initially; black licorice; rye spices; vanilla sweetness; aged oak; caramel; hint of butterscotch

Finish- Long, spicy finish; Dark plums; aged oak; baking spices; anise 


Balanced, drinks below it’s proof, and most importantly, unique. The nose is that of an aged rye, and very enjoyable, but is just above average. The palate is full of citrus, rye spice, aged oak, and sweet butterscotch and vanilla. Extremely good on the palate. The finish is where this shines, and where the plum cask really comes though. Such a unique note of dark, juicy plums that’s unlike anything else and is SO tasty. As far as the price goes, $500 is $500, but this is damn tasty, and in a very cool bottle to boot."

4.5,Incredible mouth feel and flavor. It runs for all corners of your mouth. Maybe not worth the absurd price but definitely worth trying. Delicious.

4.25,"Unfortunately drank this one after the Boss Hog V: Spirit of Mauve. As a staunch rye drinker, the Samurai Scientist underwhelms, but makes up for its short comings with a slightly more complex palate.

Nose: Apples and cinnamon with subtle herbal notes.

Palate: Apples, oak, and more apples. Slight spice that opens up on the tongue and burns off at the back of the throat. Doesn’t travel down to the chest like the V. Lighter hints of vanilla and molasses. Feels like a much lower ABV. Could go through a bottle of this by accident.

Finish: The vanilla comes late and stays late. Apples continue and with the cinnamon subsiding. 

Need to try again, but wouldn’t pay $50+ per pour."

3.75,"Love the name
Samurai: Would indicate Japanese  influence 
Scientist: Expert knowledge... in this case of whiskey 
Do not really pick much up on the nose
Not picking up traditional rye ""spice""
Long finish
Might have to come back to this
...But did not blow me away
#1 like was the apparently high proof which stood out in a pleasant way
Based on cost it did not meet my expectations"
4.5,"Delicious, but does it taste like a $500 bourbon? 🤔"
4.5,"The herbaceous notes really add to the rich, sweet, and spicy notes you expect from a rye. It has this great rounded palate that seems to make it taste more rich and the high proof is really great it's not unbearably hot, infact it just makes the vanilla notes pop."

5.0,"Amazing! (As it should be for $499/bottle!)
I had a $10 sample...Amazing flavors."
4.0,very warm in your throat. i like it. warm and spicy. but not TOO spicy. don’t have many more notes
4.0,So much to unpack.  Letting it rest went a long way.  After a few minutes out came the Vanilla and dark fruit.  A couple of drops of water later the experience deepened and flavors spread out
4.75,"Hands down my favorite from this line.  Amazing fruit and sweet in the nose!  Taste hits those notes, possibly plum fruit, and adds some spice.  A little more heat than the previous two, but finish is smooth and complex."

5.0,"Simply amazing. Quite a complex and sophisticated taste leaving you wanting more to see if you can find more of the hidden flavors. Don’t let the proof scare you, it’s smoother than it has any right to be."
5.0,"Nose: Sourdough bread.  Brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon.  Orange blossom water.  Strawberry, banana.  Butter.  Raisins.  I'm reminded of the cinnamon, sugar, and butter mixture when you make cinnamon rolls.  Apples.  Mint.  Stone fruits - peaches especially.  Very rounded, warm, and sweet, but not cloying.

Palate: Brown sugar, vanilla, prune, raisin, fig.  Oak and tannin - drying and bitter, but in a very tasteful way.  Mint, apple.  Figs, peaches, mandarins, banana.  Molasses.  Finish is vanilla, stone fruits, oak, tannin, char - apple and peach pie both come to mind.

Other notes: This is a special sip.  Boss Hog V was polarizing to some, VI is much more approachable and friendly.  The proof isn't off-putting, while the richness and depth of flavor are worthy of exploration."

4.75,"Wow, just wow. How do they pull this off year after year? The Boss Hogs have a special place in my heart and the Samurai is no exception. Make sure to read the story before you sip, the sweet scent of plum comes through on the nose before the complex flavor evolves and finishes in a deep Canadian pine forest. Just remarkable. Pappy eat your heart out."
4.75,"Really nice light nose, bright fruits with honey and licorice. Really beautiful, bit of heat on the tongue but shockingly smooth for a barrel proof. It is fruity and big and herbal. Finish goes on forever."
