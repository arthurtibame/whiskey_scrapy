4.0,"Don't be dismayed by the David Beckham commercials, as grain whiskys go, it is not bad, light, friendly on ice, but still very flavorful and distinctive. Enjoyed it more then I thought I would. (Have tried Teeling Irish Single Grain, Nikka Coffey Grain, Loch Lomond single grain)"

1.0,The Clubman is a whiskey purposely made for mixing with cola. Unfortunately I didn’t know that until after I purchased. It is very difficult to drink straight.
