3.5,"Floral nose upon first smell not really picking up any rum funk as of now. 
Upon sipped the flavor profile is full of spice,clover, hints of leather and gentle oak. However the finish is where the rum presence makes itself known it’s got a gentle sweetness at first and has a long Spicy finish that has that old rum funk to it at the end.
OverAll it’s not a bad pour and a solid $26 spent"
