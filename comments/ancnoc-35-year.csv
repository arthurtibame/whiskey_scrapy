4.5,"Nose - Rich but light caramel, lemon curd/custard, hint of barrel-aged sweet white wine, honey, dark apple juice

Taste - Bright green apples, floral honey, toffee, light hay?, caramel, oily & rich mouthfeel, light dried peach/apricot sweet

Finish - Long lasting, gentle wood & spice, rich warm sweet, sweet leather richness

Score - 93/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite amazing. From the nose even with the low proof, you could tell this was a nicely aged Scotch. Super well balanced from start to finish and full of flavor despite the lower proof. A bit on the lighter side of things, but with nice hints of rich toffee and caramel to nudge it into the rich category versus the super light & floral. Great balance of flavors and an amazing dram.
