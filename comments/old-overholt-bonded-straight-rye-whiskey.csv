3.0,"Look: the color comes in at a burnt orange, fairy dark, but not exactly brown. Slight alcohol legs show with a swirl of the glass.

Nose: plenty of rye aspects pop out, but seem a little light. All spice, clove, caramel.

Taste: plenty of the rye shows initially, with spice hitting the front of my tongue. After a few sips, the middle of the mouth gets some pear/apple/fruity notes, followed by more caramel, vanilla and rye.

Feel: the heat isn’t terribly high on this, with little burn. The finish is shorter as well. 

Overall: a nice bourbon, but it’s not going to knock Rittenhouse rye off my preferred bottled in bond rye. Probably about a 3.5"

4.0,"Even with a step up in proof from the standard Old Overholt offering, the bonded version maintains the nice combination of spicy and sweet that makes its 80-proof counterpart excellent in a variety of whiskey or bourbon cocktails. Drank this neat, then with a few drops of water. (Price note: $33 for a 1-liter bottle.)"

1.5,"It's rye. It's bonded. It's cheap. But it's not very good. Not bad, but almost. Hot and rough straight and ruins a Manhattan, even with Carpano Antica! Not bad in a Sazerac, but at this point I'm really just trying to get rid of it to open up the space on my shelf."
3.25,"The expert review is mostly accurate, but this is not a very exciting rye. While the 50% abv heat is pleasant, it ultimately comes up short on flavor. Makes a decent manhattan, but nothing special. At the same price point, Rittenhouse wins hands down. Not bad, especially at the $24, but Rittenhouse is only $25!"

4.0,"Great low-end Rye that's a bit off the beaten path (at least among my ilk). It's not doing anything you haven't experienced in a Rye before, but it is doing everything well. I prefer it in an old-fashioned as opposed to straight, but that's typically the case for Rye's and me."

3.0,"I've been on a rye kick lately. Old Overholt was one of my first ryes and when I saw the Bottled in Bond version in stock I had to give it a try. Tasted neat in a Glencairn...

Appearance: Pale gold with skinny fast moving legs

Nose: Lots of alcohol on the first try. Let it settle for a few minutes and notes of wood, straw, fresh cut wildflowers, and rye spice emerge. However, the alcohol is still fairly aggressive. A little more time in the glass yields a hint of creamed corn.

Neat: It enters the palate spicy and aggressive. A peppery tingle followed by notes of cream soda, caramel, and butterscotch are there, but despite the extra age this one still seems a little unrefined and harsh. Middle palate to the finish feature astringent oak and spice with a lasting coating of tingly cinnamon. Absolutely zero dill like I find in some of the higher percent ryes.

Splash: Doesn't change much on the nose, but smooths out the palate considerably. A nice vanilla/cherry coke note with a reduced tingle. It also helps with the astringency. 

Verdict: Strictly a mixer for me, which is OK. I think that it is what this was intended for and it will probably shine in that role. However, I really don't know if the extra age and slightly higher proof is worth the $5 price difference over the standard issue Old O. I'll let you know what I think after an Old Fashioned or two."

3.25,"For me, nose is candied pecans/walnuts. Oak, spice, and brown sugar sweetness on the tongue"
3.75,"Copper in color. Strong aromas of wood spices, cinnamon, corn oil, vanilla and brown sugar on the nose. This definitely tastes like a thin, young (4 year old) rye...but it’s got quite a bit going on. Sweet corn, white pepper and light oak are all prominent players in a fairly well-balanced flavor profile. It’s not overly harsh on its own, but a drop of water mellows it even more and gives it some citrus attributes. 3.7."

Taste: Big red bubblegum, herbs."

3.75,"Nose... A slight cinnamon, apple, pepper, nutmeg and caramel come to mind.

Color... Medium copper to the much sought after mahogany.

Taste... The rye finds it's way to the forefront, and while it lingers a bit, the corn comes through with authority. Next there were hints of chocolate, pepper, cinnamon and apricot. 

Overall... It's definitely there as far as BIB is concerned. The age is there when it comes to the consistency and the ever present age that the 4 years offers. Like many BIB I've tried, this comes across as a dessert in a glass. 

That said, it's not a Rye in the sense that you'd hope to find, especially with 4 years in the barrel. The Rye isn't long lasting, the spice doesn't linger and it's lacking in depth. The corn overtakes the bottle and it leaves me wondering about the overall ratio. It's good, just not good to great...."

4.0,"Neat I get lots of spice and vanilla. Creamy and spicy with a tiny bit of nuttiness. In my glencairn the proof overwhelms a lot of anything else you get on the nose. makes a terrific old fashioned with a splash of simple syrup, slice of orange and some ango orange bitters. Gets + a half star for the price / value."

2.5,"Aroma: ethanol, apple cinnamon, slight spice, grain bread, slight caramel and vanilla towards the back

Taste: grain alcohol, cinnamon spice, sweet

This isn’t a complex rye, it’s a straightforward lower shelf rye. It’s not complex, but it’s easy to sip. If you are looking for a cheap rye, and bonded, this is a great option. But you won’t be spending much time on the notes this has to offer."

3.5,Good value full flavored rye.
3.5,"Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has baking spices over oak, leather, dried grasses, orange peel.  Taste has definite spice - with lots of them intermingling - over oak, vanilla, dried orange candies, meadow grass, with a final cinnamon jolt.  Lingering spicy finish.  Good, not great, but nice for the price.  12/18/19."

3.5,"Tried in a cocktail glass at a bar in Philly.

The nose has a decent amount of rye spice, some cola. 

The palate has more of the nose and a little bit of light leather. Fairly light.

The finish is on the shorter side, with a slight ethanol flavor, but not too bad."

3.75,"I once observed that standard Old Overholt was the platonic ""beer and a shot"" whiskey--flavourful with a bit of youthful bite, but reasonably balanced and well-made, its flaws compensated for by a sip of crisp lager. If that's true (and I believe it is), then Old Overholt's new-ish bonded sibling is the whiskey on the rocks you sip slowly and sorrowfully in some out-of-the-way dive bar. Which isn't necessarily a criticism. I'd never drink this straight (it's fairly fiery at full proof, and the youth is evident), but over ice, it's genuinely enjoyable, no beer needed: grassy, sweet, caramel, caraway and pepper. Slight Beam nuttiness and faint citrus. Long lingering vanilla. Punches well above its weight-class, but doesn't have any pretensions about what it is at heart."

3.25,Daaaaaamn that's spicy.  I bought this because I saw an old photo of Slayer drinking it.  It's certainly a metal Bourbon and it's the same exact label as the photo from the 80s.  It was like $22.  I'd get it again.
2.75,"My first Rye a good one at that. I loved the spice and vanilla notes that demanded attention with this 100 proof whiskey. Probably the spiciest whiskey to date for me, but pleasant. Oak and vanilla notes throughout. Medium finish.

$6/pour"
3.5,"There it is again!  That unmistakable, Beam peanut flavor profile!

On the nose, a very attractive fruity scent profile with with butterscotch toffee, caramel, and peaches. Not a lot of spice or pepper.

The first thing that hits me is the peanut profile that comes through in all things Beam. After a minute or two to open up, the rye spiciness is more evident. But this is a very light rye even at 100 proof.  Some bright jamminess with a touch of bitterness at the end gives this depth, and the finish is medium-long, but overall not complicated nor evolving.

At $20, it's hard to say that this isn't a good value, but it's also not a hidden gem that punches above it's weight"
