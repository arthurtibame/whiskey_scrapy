3.0,"Apples, honey and some floral notes on the nose. Warm and sweet mouthful with more orchard fruit, hints of melon and slightly bitter oak tanins on the palate. The finish is fairly dry and of considerable length. Not bad when tried neat, but much better with a few drops of water."

4.0,"Wow, my 300th review... Does this make me an enthusiast, a connoisseur, or someone who needs to get a life? Regardless I LOVE WHISKY and I liked this expression. It's a little flawed, the way some of the notes just don't come together nicely, but I appreciate the craft behind its making and the end result is pleasant. The nose has wonderful hints of apple juice and oak (much more bourbon than sherry), with a very faint note of honey. The palate is full and savory thanks to its 51% ABV, and the finish is smooth and long-lasting. Good stuff."

4.0,"Nose - Warm & gentle spice, toasted bread, ginger, candied ginger w/ skin, light earthy bitter

Taste - Gentle heat/tingle, apple/pear, dark simple syrup, light ginger spice, creamy/waxy mouthfeel, light golden raisin sweet

Finish - Lingering waxy mouthfeel, sweet apples, toasted brioche, ginger heat, light bitterness that goes in & out

Score - 81/100

Final Thoughts - This one was a bit muted at first on the nose but finally opened up after a few minutes to a fairly standard unpeated malt profile of apples/pears & warm/toasted malt. The creamy/waxy mouthfeel was a bit unexpected as it reminded me of a Clynelish. Higher proof was nice but the bitterness on the finish was a bit unexpected.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.5,"I am now fan of higher strength whiskies, i want everything they offer, lots of aroma notes, lots of flavor. This one is the Glenfiddich Distiller's edition, 15yo, 51%abv. It has been matured in ex-oloroso sherry casks and ex-bourbon casks.

On the nose, it is the most fruity dram that has ever existed. Every fruit is in here. Orange, Lemon, Lime, Cherries, Prunes; it is so fruity. Lemon candy, orange candy.

For 51%abv not hard to perceive at all. No alcohol note. Vanilla and caramel. Red fruits, fresh fruits, milk powder. 

On the palate, it has a lot of character. Very spicy. Almonds, very Oily and Oaky. Prunes, Hazelnut, Red apples, Cinnamon and Red apple peel.

Aftertaste is amazing. The most pleasant black pepper and Cinnamon spice ever. Delicious. Very long.

Overall this is a fantastic whisky. For 80 dollars, i would totally recommend it. 92 over 100."

2.75,"Nose: Quite a gentle combination of fruity aromas (apples, peaches, pears) with a hint of vanilla and oak spice. Water releases sweet orange and fresh-milled barley grist. Fresh, soft and relaxing overall.

Palate: Easy on the arrival with sweet cereal and citrus notes, it turns spicy in the development with a wave of cinnamon, nutmeg and a sprinkling of white pepper. It does not become sharp, but there is a soft tannic presence that turns bitter/sour towards the finish. The texture is nothing special. Adding water greatly improves the palate by developing sweetness and knitting everything together. It also brings out more spices - cloves, allspice and anise (but quite mild).

Finish: Short. Dry malty notes when neat. With water the finish is more gradual (but still short) and the aftertaste is sweeter and creamy with a hint of citrus.

The official tasting notes here are accurate, but I wouldn't score this whisky quite as highly. Initially I thought this was a pretty average malt with little of interest happening, but it improved over time, particularly with the addition of a teaspoon of water.

Tasted from a 30ml sample. Until recently this was just under $100 here, but now it is around $135 and at that price it is outclassed by the competition and I would not recommend it.

""Average"" : 2.75 stars"
