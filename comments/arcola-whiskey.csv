3.5,"Right off the get go...the cloudiness and sediment inside the bottle made it stand out. Finished in a wine cask, the product is appealingly raw in appearance. The nose is sweet with red wine black currant notes. There is a layer of what I can only describe as warm plastic in the background. The palette is very light on the front. So light that I cant get past the wine barrell. Theres more to it for sure, but I lack the experience to notate it"

3.0,"I picked up a bottle of this in Cheyenne, WY.  The nose is on the lighter side with a mild caramel aroma.  I also detected a hint of cardboard, but it wasn't bad.  The flavor is light as well.  There's a little bit of alcohol heat, and underneath that is a little caramel sweetness.  I'm not sure what the mash bill is other than the label saying that it's made from ""bourbon mash"", but it tastes like it might be higher in malted barley than your average bourbon.  Overall not a bad whiskey, but better suited to people who like lighter whiskeys."
