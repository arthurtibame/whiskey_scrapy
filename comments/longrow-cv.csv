5.0,"As a heavily peated single malt you expect it to be full of peat & Smokey flavours reminiscent of Applewood smoked Cheddar heading almost into smoked Haddock (that mineral, tin ? like element), but what hits first is how sweet  it is, yet not cloyingly so. Because before the sweetness hits overkill, I would say the peat comes in to balance it, what I mean, is this stunning spicy peaty gorgeousness clubs your senses reducing the sweetness to almost the backing choir. The finish has that vanilla fudge but it's sharing bed space with the peat which has a dry ginger pepperiness to it, which is a bit like  when you were a kid & you put a 9 volt battery on your tongue - that sense of metallic, but in a good way."
4.0,"This is a very nice whisky - balanced and engaging.   Longrow is billed as ""heavily peated"", but it's not a peat blast reminiscent of Islay.  While the peat certainly isn't subtle, it's a very nice smoke that's pervasive throughout the nose and palate without ever overpowering the other elements of the dram.   

The three types of casks used - bourbon, rum and sherry - create a finishing element that presents in a unified way.  In fact, it seems as if only one type of cask had been used.  The combined taste reminded me of a cognac finish - fruity, a bit sweet, some wood and a touch of spice.  

If it hadn't been discontinued some years ago, I'd buy a bottle.  But I'm very glad I got the chance to sample it; thank you @richardmoderndrinking for the pour!  Maybe we'll see something similar from Longrow in the future."
3.75,"I never revisited this bottle after buying it four years ago as there was a discordant metallic note on the finish when I tasted it initially. Since then I’ve given most of it away in swaps but decided to try it again while pouring a sample for @jonwilkinson7309. I’m glad I did as that off note is no longer there, perhaps thanks to some beneficial oxidation or just the fact that I was having an off day when I first tried it. What’s left is a classic Longrow with a heather and peat nose and a palate that nicely balances a light peat and a dash of sweetness. Longrow will never be my favorite peated whisky, but this one is a good benchmark for anyone exploring the brand’s range."

4.0,"I've always been a fan of Campbeltown; just something about it's charcoal-y smoke combined with floral and citrusy aromas.   Thanks to  [email protected], I got to sample this.  I'm that much more appreciative considering how rare this one is; it's discontinued now.   The aromas and flavors are like Springbank 10, except a bit more nuanced on the smoke and intensity.  Maybe because of the usage of various casks?   If you're a fan of Springbank, but want someting a bit gentler with more fruits and nuts on the palette, this would be right up your alley.  Well balance, austere, and complex enough to make you want to come back for more.   After having this, I immediately took a look at our Total Wine site for Union, NJ...all sold out.  If you find it, worthwhile sipper.   Thanks Richard!"

3.0,"Figuring it was time to expand my tastes from the islands, I decided to dive into an exploration of Springbank with this bottle that I discovered neglected at a Total Wine. The nose was very promising: big peat but with delicate undertones of heather. It started out nicely in the mouth too with a good balance of peat and sweetness, but faded out too quickly to discern more specific flavors. Unfortunately there was a slightly metallic aftertaste, a discordant note given the balance of flavors leading up to it. A disappointing experience that didn't live up to the ratings here or my excitement in finding a dusty bottle of this discontinued edition, but I plan to try other bottles from the distillery. What should I try next, Springbank fans?"
