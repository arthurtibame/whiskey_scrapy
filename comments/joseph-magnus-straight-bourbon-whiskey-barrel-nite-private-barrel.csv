3.75,Small bye good vanilla Towns finish his food
4.75,"The nose is rich and complex, with dusty caramel, crunchy peanut butter, strong vanilla, toffee, allspice, and oddly hints of KitKat bar and nougat. The palate is immediately sweet and nutty, with notes of milk chocolate, raisins, English toffee, molasses, and honeyed peanut butter. The mid palate introduces caramelized sugars, toasted marshmallow, slightly burnt buttered popcorn, hints of chocolate-orange, and a mildly bitter and spicy caramel that really engulfs the tongue. On the finish, you get caramel, roasted nuts, tobacco leaf, and light barrel char. A beautifully sweet, complex, and modestly spicy bourbon. This bottle is from the Whiskey & Barrel Nite - Chicago. It is an unfinished, 8-9 year old straight bourbon (Dickel juice), bottled at a toasty 60.7% ABV."

4.75,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"".  This is a 60.7% Binny's barrel pick that was unfinished ie: no cask finish like the usual Magnus stuff.

Nose: Very subtle caramelized sugar sweetness and woody flavors like cedar.  A little bit of pine as well.  There is more below the surface but it doesn't shine through until the first taste.

Flavor: Wow.  This one is complex.  Vanilla, caramel, nougat, toasted nuts, dark chocolate, light dried fruits.  Basically this tastes like a dark chocolate snickers bar.  Oily, rich, and buttery.

Finish: A long drying finish that somehow turns sweet at the end.  More snickers bars with nougat, caramel, and toasted nuts.  Lightly woody at the end.

Truly one of the best bourbons I've tried.  Shame once it's gone there is no more."
4.5,"Smooth, great taste"
4.75,"Neat. DEP store pick.  Powerful nose on this one. One to sit and deconstruct.  Lot of oak.  Cocao.  Baking spice. Vanilla.  Caramel.  Buttery corn.  Some nice fruit, cherry.  Really hits every note on the wheel the more you explore it.  Probably one of the strongest first impressions on the nose I can recall.  Hard to believe this 122 proof too.  I can bury deep and get no burn.  Nice creamy mouth feel, sugar and cinnamon hit the palate.  Waves of flavors on the taste. It’s really really good.  Chocolate and oak on the front, gives way to tons of vanilla.  Vanilla gives way to spice on the legs.  Legs go for miles.  

Going back to the nose after a few sips.  A nutty note emerges and that vanilla makes a more dominant presence.  

This is a treat."

4.75,"Nose (4.5):  Cocoa and peanut brittle on the nose.  Reminded me of a Heath bar.  Made me want more

Palate (4.75):  Great complexity.  Heathbar continues with some welcoming spices.  Leathery tones with a hint of cigar box.  You get all the traditional flavors with tremendous other layers.

Finish: (4.75) Finishes for days.  Nice heat that ends in a puff of sweet smokiness.  Very well done."
4.25,"A pleasant aroma and taste of nuttiness, almost like walnuts, with hints of chocolate and English toffee.  A nice departure from the common vanilla, camel notes of most bourbons...really good stuff!!"
