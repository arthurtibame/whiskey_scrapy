4.25,Hmm. Beautiful honey viscosity but honestly Red Breast 15 or Powers John Lane 12 at 1/3rd the price taste the same and are just as good. Yellow Spot is better as that has complexity and this is more one dimensional.  It's slightly astringent or hot for the abv. Was tempted to factor price in and drop it to a three rating but given its been drunk with a flight of other whiskies and not a full opened bottle over time 4 it is. I am sorely tempted though..if a half star rating comes available on distiller this is getting rated down due to exorbitant price. Update 10/19. Ok having retried this by itself at leisure my rating hasn't changed to much. It's a great dram but don't think it's excellent. For the price you can do better.

5.0,"Rich & full bodied
Nose, fruit & spice
Taste, rich, sweet, 
Finish, pleasant, long

Tasted at the Dublin airport w Carl. Very smooth and balanced"
4.0,"Liza is right! A master had to create this blend. Hugely expensive though!  What a complex, shifting taste. NOSE- toffee, yum, then intense perfume, floral, and give it a minute chocolate wafts in; PALATE-Spicy, oily, thick, toffee again, then oranges and marmalade, the oak is there but faint; FINISH-strong, lingers delightfully, malty, chocolate makes a comeback, slightly bitter towards the end. Even though a blend (I prefer single malts) this is superb! Only let down by its price :)"

4.0,A fine whiskey but for me not worth the price point. Typical Jameson vanilla throughout with tart fruits and light spice on the nose - citrus and oak on the palette and medium finish.

5.0,"4.5
Every good smooth with the hint of berries very tasty"
4.0,"Rich on the nose, mild malt, spice, cinnamon bread, cream, apple. Some wood and vanilla hints. Lots of depth here. The legs are thick, coats the glass. Viscous in the mouth. Creamy malt on the tongue, balanced sweetness, coffee and dark chocolate. The spice lingers in a ridiculously long finish. After a few sips there's a fruity aftertaste. Definitely the fullest Irish whiskey I've had. Quite savage. 7/28/17
All of the above still rings true. This time I also get lots of toasted sugar and honey on the nose. Creamy malt and orchard fruit. Slightly more bitter on the front end than I remember, but this is still thick, dense, rich. A bit more citrus than last time. Still a loooooooong finish. Leaves my mouth tingling. 4/21/18"

5.0,"Sep 2017
The full bottle typically costs around €250 and so is out of my comfort range but I was lucky enough to receive a gift pack that included a miniature bottle of it along with Redbreast 12, Green Spot, and Powers John's Lane (
http://mitchellandson.com/single-pot-still-4x50ml-gift-pack.html).

A few drops of water improved it slightly. The nose is of honey and toffee and tastes of orange and other fruits ending with a wonderfully lingering aftertaste. It is a torture to know that due to the price my opportunities to enjoy this frequently will be few and far between. However, the other three whiskeys in the pack are top notch and can be bought without the risk of defaulting on a mortgage payment."

4.0,"Slightly bunged when drinking it so no good for the smelling.

Tastes of honey and caramel. Very smooth.

Stays in the throat.

Goes down like a dessert. Excellent to drink. Buy this if you can. Pricey though at about €220-€250. Try to get it."

4.75,"Master Distiller – Barry Crockett. Serial number 2577 and 7937 (original signature by Barry).

The Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy was created to commemorate the career of the former master distiller who retired in 2013 after 47 years at the distillery. Barry himself helped to formulate this single pot still and it is highly regarded as one of the best in the range. The pot still elements used are drawn from light, medium and heavy styles and the spirit is mostly matured in 1st fill bourbon casks with a small amount going into virgin American oak. There is no age statement but some of the whiskey used is very old (around 25 years).

Nose - Soft and delicate aromas with honey, white flowers, baked bread and some caramel.
Taste - Soft and light - Citrus fruits, mixed peel, toffee, cocoa, honey - dash of water will bring more fruitiness.

Great whiskey, but prefer the Dair Ghaelach a bit more.

Bought this when finished the Midleton Academy course with Jamie.

5.0,Very delightful! Drinks like a great highland single malt. Mild peaty front. Sweet-ish finish.
4.5,When u want to tell her she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to u.
4.5,"Nose: New-mown hay, barley, sage, rosemary, papaya, ghee, tinned fruit salad (you smell both the fruit and the tinned metal can), baked apples, green mangoes, fresh-ground coffee, pipe tobacco. After resting for a while some vanilla and surprisingly zappy, cedary oak emerges.

Palate: Creamy, herbal, earthy and deep spice arrival - almost like mango chutney and raita. Sweet at first on the front of the tongue, it gains rich, but soft, spicy tones as it moves around the mouth - ginger, orange and some honey. Hugely expressive and satisfying - it reminds me of goat tagine with mint tea on the side. There is a bright intensity that is balanced by a deep spicy warmth and a grassy cereal presence that is never far away.

Finish: Very long and lingering. The palate slowly segues into the finish and the herbal spices gradually ease away, replaced by a most refreshing sweet minty note in the aftertaste.

Immediately after pouring the nose is slightly funky on this whiskey but with a few minutes of rest everything starts to relax and merge. It never loses its dark herbal and fruity profile however (thankfully!).  Don't add water - it just turns down the volume and this one should be enjoyed at full force.

There is something about this that is uncannily like some of the best Mortlach expressions. A funky, earthy, meaty character that is here balanced by a very fine herbal-fruity presence. Maybe they should call it the ""Beast of Midleton""?

 I enjoyed this immensely and it was a great way to finish today's tasting of Irish whiskey. The only problem is its exorbitantly high price. For the same money I can buy truly wonderful cask-strength independently bottled Scotch whisky that, as good as this is, far eclipses it.  It's an excellent whiskey, nontheless, and recommended if you have deep pockets.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"
