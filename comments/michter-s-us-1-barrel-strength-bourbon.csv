4.75,"Taste:  2.0 oz in glen cairn neat and then 2 drops distilled water.  109.7 proof

Nose:  (4.75) Chocolate, cinnamon, toasty rye bread with a bit of dill.  The nose is deliciously rich and inviting 

Palate: (4 75)  Rich and buttery feel.  The dark chocolate gives way to cherry and spucy rye.  2 drops reveal more sweet brown sugar and tone done a bit of the spiciness.  Rye fans will enjoy this sans water.  Bourbon fans will love the sweet sugary notes after water.

Finish (4.5) Medium to long amd satisfying.  Warm butterred bread and nutmeg dominate.

Overall:  One of the best ryes I have had this year.  It is so full, so rich, and so layered.  Everytime I take a pour I get something else in terms of taste or finish.  I have really reserved my evaluation on this because I wanted to be sure before going head over heels.  After 2/3 through first bottle and buying a second I am sure.....this is a great rye!"

Finish: leaves you wanting more"
null,"Really damn good. Big alcohol burn, as expected, but great flavor. Lots of wood, oak, baking spices with some sweetness."

4.0,Nose is sweet with brown sugar. Tasting you’ll find a lot of oak with some caramel and butterscotch mixed in. Those flavors fade quickly into a touch of vanilla at the end as the alcohol takes over. Not too hot despite the proof. Good barrel strength bottle worth the retail price.
