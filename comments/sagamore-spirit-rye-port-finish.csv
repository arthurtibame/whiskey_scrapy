4.0,"Port encompasses this dram without taking the character away from the whiskey itself.

N: Rich tannic fruit notes and light spice, a sweetness tries to break through but spice prevails

P: Spicy but dark fruity notes and a dry slight bitterness encroach

F: port. It finishes like port. You started by drinking a whiskey with slight port notes and finished with a port with slight Rye whiskey notes.

Awesome balance and transformation. Deserving of its medal.

Why only 4? Bc I want, with my palate a fairly prominent whiskey note start to finish neat. It's a bias. If I got more spice with the fruit dry finish this would easily be 4.5-5."

4.25,"This Whiskey was selected as the best overall Rye at the 2019 SF spirits festival and came in 2nd as best overall Whiskey to the one that shall not be named! In doing some research on it, it turns out that this is a blend of 2 MGP sourced ryes. One is a high rye mashbill (95% rye) and the other is a low rye mashbill (51% rye). Those Ryes are then finished in 59 gallon port Casks sourced from Portugal and a local winery Boordy Vinyards in Baltimore for an additional 6 months. Now we don't have to look very far for an obvious comparison as Sagamore has clearly drawn inspiration from High West's MidWinter Rye. For comparisons sake I will be tasting this again Act 6 Scene 2 to see how they stack up against each other.
Now the Sagamore is 101 proof vs the MWND at 98.6 proof. The Sagamore has an SRP of $79 (price paid $63) vs $100 (price paid $90) for the MWND. 
Let's move to the Sagamore tasting:
Upfront it's a creamy entry with vanilla, cherry and an array of baking spices. Mid pallette starts with rye and pepper spices with a lovely fig note in the background. The finish is long with toasted oak, baking spices and finally an array of red fruits reveal themselves. It's a lovely conclusion to a surprisingly well constructed Whiskey. The port influence is there but is much more subtle than expected. Make no mistake this one is all Rye and is simply complemented by the port but not overpowered. 
In then tasting the MWND, I was really surprised by how underwhelming it was when compared to the Sagamore. Not as complex and felt somewhat disjointed. It's was a little richer than the Sagamore, but the Sagamore is clearly the better Whiskey, especially for the Rye purists out there. 
In conclusion, at a 20% discount and readily available in most markets, this would be my choice. 
Cheers all!"
4.0,"The port is there, but in the background, lending a dark fruit note of date and raisin. Plenty of rye spice balanced with sweetness. I’m getting vanilla and brown bread. Nicely done."

4.25,"Sight - Dark cherry blood
Nose -Syrup, dark cherries with some plum and spice. 
Taste - A plum dried cherries with some dark chocolate and that rye spice punch that's smooth all the way
Finish - A long lasting dark chocolate cherry with hints of apple that will leave your mouth a bit dry but keep you warm."
4.0,Has the same spice as the others but extremely smooth and delicious. Best of the bunch!
3.5,"Asrtingent, not very sweet, subtle and then everything hits at once. New to rye do I don't know how it compares.  Good but not great."

3.75,Has a kick but not super heavy rye
2.5,"Batch 7A... Overall spicy/harsh nose of rye bread, black pepper, lemon/lime zest, ethanol balanced slightly with a healthy dose of maple. Fortunately, the sip improves a little on the nose with a healthy dose of  sweet cherry fruit on entry that builds into an intense rye kick, with a bit of harsh heat before fading. The finish is warm and lingers, but unfortunately the notes are bitter/astringent, green pepper, new oak. Overall, from the midpalate to the finish, I would rate this an unpleasant pour. This will rank with Peerless Rye as one of my most overprice bottles."

4.5,"Tasted a bit young to my tongue. The toffee really stood out to my nose. I truly enjoyed this dram. Some may not enjoy port finishes on their rye, but I fancy it when done correctly. Sagamore has done it correctly, trust me. I will be keeping a bottle in my permanent rotation. 
N- spice, toffee 
P- dark chocolate, plum, rye spice
F- dry, caramel"

4.0,"That time of year again. College starts on Monday, so I find myself in Maryland getting ready for another move in.  Before I left with my son (yes, he’s the one going to college), I figured, when in Rome (or Maryland), I would grab this sample where this spirit has been created, and if time permitted, I would sample.  Well, I found some time. 

The color is a rich amber with a slight strawberry hue. The nose is akin to A Midwinters Night Dram.  Cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon baking spices mixed in with dill, vanilla cream, maraschino cherries, ripened plums.  Dig some more, and milk chocolate and raisins (Raisinets) add more sweetness to the baking spices. 

First draw on the palate is anesthetizing, thick and creamy and most definitely, sweet.  Those spices found on the nose are embodied on the palate.  Vanilla, brown sugar provides the sugary sweetness encasing dill, cloves, nutmeg and white pepper.  Buried in the potpourri of flavors, some stone fruits work their way through: plums, black cherries.  A trace of pomegranate comes forward towards the finish. 

Fruits and oak tannins and spices with a smidge of vanilla cream ride the finish for a good length.  The palate remains woody and drying that keep the mouth dry all evening. 

The addition of water dampens the spicy edge and that creamy body becomes thinner while retaining all the sweetness.  Definitely better at full strength. 

A solid offering from Sagamore Spirits.  Full of sugar and spice and everything nice.  A fair amount of depth backed with at full cask strength.  A fantastic alternative to AMWND at two-thirds the cost.  Most of the Sagamore line that I have sampled were decent but nothing that would turn my head.  This, however, is a head turner and worthy to seek, sample and purchase. Thanks @dubz480 for the generous sample. A nice little surprise. [89/100][Tasted: 8/24/19]"
