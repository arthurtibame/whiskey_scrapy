5.0,"Nose is full of tropical fruit and sweetness, fruit cocktail.  Palate matches with some caramel.  Long finish.  

With some water and left out for more than 15 minutes, the palate changed to a distinct salted caramel taste, which was a wonderful surprise"

5.0,"[NOSE] mango, dark grape, black berry, caramelized brown sugar, followed by an outburst of grapefruit peel spiciness.  [PALATE] Powerful arrival of sweetness, fusion of caramel + toffee + dark chocolate.  Vivid oakiness.  Notes of vanilla, honey, grape tannin and mixed fruits on the way down the throat.  [FINISH] continuum of tropical fruity tones + vanilla, which give ways to milky chocolate.  Lingering and long lasting.  [COMMENT] A truly awesome and unique single malt whisky, extremely flavorful, great depth of complexity. Lovely indeed.  (95/100)"

5.0,For such a young whiskey this is an incredibly complex dram. The wine casks give it some notes that I'm used to smelling on a port finished single malt with some dried fruits and grapeyness but I also get some espresso and tobacco. I get some milk chocolate and fruitiness on the palate and some heat before a long chocolatey finish

5.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Grilled pineapple sweet, tropical floral fruits, toasted honeyed brioche, caramelized red berries, dark vanilla caramels, hint of cantaloupe (w/ water) Adds a bit of deep fried sweet plantains to the mix in addition to some tropical honey.
Taste - (w/o water) Tropical floral fruity heat, grilled pineapple, tellicherry peppercorn sweet heat/tingle, cantaloupe, light oaky vanilla caramels, berry pastries (w/ water) Tames the heat a bit, caramelized grilled pineapple char sweetness, more melon.
Finish - (w/o water) Lingering sweet spicy tingle, refreshing grilled pineapple caramelized sugar sweet, long tropical fruit sweetness. (w/ water) Somehow it feels more drying, but feels like more cooked/grilled/caramelized tropical fruits.
Score - 90/100
Final Thoughts - This is a very interesting single malt in that it toes the line between a very tropical malt and a classic bourbon. I get notes of the vanilla caramel but at the same time it's very fruity and tropical feeling. It gives me the impression of being the perfect dram to enjoy at the beach or poolside. Nice hints of caramelized tropical fruits through & through. A bit hot without water, but it seems like the addition of water doesn't really affect it too much but it does help it a bit. I think this would be best served neat with some fruit or over a single large ice cube."

5.0,"This definately can use a bit of water.  Without it, it's like eating wasabi.   Once water is added, the heat calms down and you can smell a grape-y, grassy, malty aroma.  Let it sit for a while, and the taste is well balanced between vanilla and red grapes.  I'm not a fan of the finish though, it's rough and you can feel the tingle in your nose.  I think the key in this one is water, and letting it sit out for a while.  I'm on vacation in Maui, and actually bought this bottle along to enjoy here. Glad I did.  Update 6/30/18:  just opened a new bottle of this...back when I had it the first time, I wasn’t really blown away.  And I realized why—-two years ago, when I had this, it was over a large cube of ice.  Don’t do that to this.  Lesson learned.  This time, just a 1/2 teaspoon of water, and wow...the flavors really opened.  Dark cherries, figs, raspberry...oily sweet with a touch of red wine tannin, but nothing overpowering.  Closest I can think of is a Yamazaki 18.  Simply amazing."

4.0,"One heck of a dark whisky.  

The nose doesn't really blow me away.  I couldn't really pull out anything worth discussing.  A very nice sweetness, some oak, and some very nice wine notes.  

The whisky opens up with sweetness and is incredibly mellow and the alcohol is completely hidden.  If that were the whisky I'd be a touch disappointed at the price point but it would still be good stuff.  Then it finishes...and finishes...and finishes...and it just keeps going.  Complex oaks, dark fruits, a blend of sweatness from anywhere you can think of.  Just one of the best finishes I've had and the opening is more than powerful enough.  

I'm down right jumping up and down excited about how good a value I got."

null,"This is a bottle kill review—-so, I don’t rate these since I usually use my last ounce for experiments.  I figured “what goes well with something rich and raisin-y sweet from port maturation?”  What about something really smoky, like an Ardbeg or Lag?  Well...I don’t have that readily on hand.  Ok...so, what about something rich and vanilla?  Like a bit of this with an equal amount of Wild Turkey Longbranch?  An American-Taiwanese fusion.  So, this is a case where the sums of both are less than the individual components.  The richness of the Kavalan was diminished by the vanilla.  The strong oak and vanilla was diminished by the port.  Became one unholy mess.  Tasted like NyQuil combined with bread pudding.  I know...don’t ask, but I know."

4.0,"This marks the final bonus sample from the Scottish Distillery Tour. A bittersweet feeling for me. The end of a long and fulfilling journey, but also the beginning of the next chapter in my own personal whisky story. I had a small sample of this Taiwanese single malt at Whiskyfest in April and I absolutely loved it. Let’s see how this sample compares. 

These are single barrel offerings, so it’s very possible that there will be differences from what I had before. This one was bottled at 59.2% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of red mahogany. 

The nose opens with baking and wood spices, but quickly turns sweet. Lots of concord grapes and raisins. Possibly the most raisiny of all raisins ever raisined...two scoops even!  Grape juice mixed with motor oil, but in a good way. Sweet wine, blackberry jam, grape jelly. Allspice or ginger, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, butterscotch and maple syrup. Plums, prunes, faint dried apricots. Old oak polished with orange oil. Much sweeter than I recall from the first time I tried it. Water reveals buttery biscuits, cranberry and cereal malt. A little bit of a vegetal note and maybe some old leather. 

The palate is super sweet and a bit spicy. Baking spices as opposed to a peppery spice. Grape jelly, grape and cherry cough syrup, cherry lozenges. Sugary raisins bring it to a close. Not at all the rich and savory dram from back in April. This is sugary and medicinal. Water brings out more medicinal notes, mostly cough syrup. 

A full bodied mouthfeel that is thick, oily and mouthwatering. 
The finish is long, sweet and bitter at the same time. Thick, cough syrup and grape juice. 

This is such a departure from the Whiskyfest sample I had months ago. That one was hands down 5 stars, rich and luxurious. This one is bittersweet and very medicinal. It would appear that either there are big variations between casks or the Whiskyfest environment was conducive to more favorable tasting notes. I’m inclined to think the former as other drams that night didn’t hold up to expectations. This cask can only warrant a 4.25, and that’s perhaps a bit generous. A big thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for sharing this $200 bottle, but I don’t think I’ll be seeking out a bottle any time soon. 
Cheers"
4.75,"Nose and pallette are above average, but that finish....oh, that finish. It's the stuff are dreams. It's the finish you've always dreamed of.

5.0,"Cask no. w0911200019b.

Generously shared by my neighbor who is from Yuanshan. It's love at first taste as intense sweet raisin curant and plum mingle up on your tongue. The 54% cask strength is deceptive there is no burn whatsoever. definitely out of my price range at US prices but my neighbor assured me you can get it at a fraction of the price back and Taiwan. I hope he hits back to visit soon so I can have him pick up a bottle."
4.25,"So, as my Saturday evening routine goes, I fumble through my backlog of samples I have acquired over time through many generous people. This has come to me by @PBMichiganWolverine  Unfortunately for me, I found this sample has lost half its content and thus the immediate need for tasting, STAT!  Better half than none.  This is my first Kavalan and of all the Kavalan’s, this  
one intrigues me most.

A fruity confection is the foundation of the aroma. Plums, concord grapes,  blackberry current and apricot jam.  The sweet is rich of dark brown sugar, vanilla, toffee with hints of baking spices.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves. Some orange zest and wood spice hover above the fruity confection. 

The arrival comes as a subtle spice but mostly sweetness.  Frosted Flakes, creek brûlée, with the glazed plums, raisins, grenadine sweetness.  A spicy current flows through the sweet with black pepper, ginger and cayenne pepper. 

The finish is Birch Beer soda, wood spices where an artificial grape notes and an oak tannins which last and for a good length. 

A good dram which will appeal to those who like sweeter drams. The less dominant spice keeps the sweetness in check.  Great aromas, good flavors.  An excellent well crafted whisky.  If I have one gripe, it would be to have a wider array of flavor on the palate, only because I want more. The other wishes I have is that I had more than an ounce I and a bottle of my own. Thanks @PbMichiganWolverine for sharing.  I would love to add this to my stock. [92/100][Tasted: 12/14/19]"

Thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine's generosity, I was able to scratch that itch with this fine bit of whiskey from Kavalan. The nose is marked by dark dried fruits, honey-roasted cashews, and sweet mulled wine. The palate has a creamy, almost buttery character (with a bit of spark from the cask strength ABV), and positively oozes dark fruit, dried tropical fruit, nuts, and spice. Very good stuff indeed!"
3.0,"1oz pour at Jack Rose. 

I was thinking of buying a bottle of this. Thank god I thought of trying it first. You just can’t trust these glowing reviews of Asian whiskies. Are they really that good? Or are people just happy to jump on the bandwagon and try something different?

This is different. Prune juice. Robitussin cherry. No. Fuck that. Buckley’s. It tastes bad, but it will cure you of constipation and upper respiratory infections. 

I struggled to see how this could have won so many awards. It needed a lot of water before I got anything pleasant in the form of a desert wine. Still, it’s just too much raisins and prunes. The finish is a fight between syrupy sweetness and bitterness that I preferred to stay out of. 

What would I pay for a bottle? $40. Haha.

null,"** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

Down to the best 2 whiskies I experienced at the festival.  It’s between this and the HP The Dark 17yo.  This one was so different than anything else we tasted that night.  It was rich and powerful with a heavy dose of grapes and raisin sweetness.  There was an interesting way the oak cask presented itself here as well.  It came across as dry, because of the near 60% ABV, and it felt as though it dried/evaporated off the tongue at one minute, only to leave your mouth watering.  It was insane.  The sweetness lingered on as well.  I actually went back to the Kavalan table 3 times to re-sample this one.  The entire sipping experience is 5 stars, while the flavor profile might not be as dynamic as the HP Dark.  That’s the only reason it wasn’t my Best In Show.  I’ve found a bottle online here in the states for $230 and I think I gotta bite.  I need more of this one.  Highly recommended.  Cheers."
null,"Review #10 of 12 from DC Whiskyfest 2018. I was only able to do 12 because I came down with something that afternoon that really messed with my head and stomach. I should have just stayed in the hotel room but I didn’t pay $350 for VIP tickets to sample my pillow!
No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

Of all the whiskies I’ve ever tried that had raisins in the profile, this one was the most raisin-y. Straight up raisins out of the box and then dipped in syrup and motor oil. Yes you read that right, motor oil, and it was fantastic. Very in your face kind of nose. 

Raisins and a sweet vermouth type of note on the palate. Wonderful. 

This was a very close #2 on the night next to HP The Dark. Another 4.5-5 Star dram."

The best way to drink these almost 60% ABV solist casks is to have them neat. Let them slowly explode and dilute in your mouth.  Chew on it and experience their superb richness and tastiness. 
Of the 3, my favourite is Vinho Barrique. However, all 3 are excellent.  Ex-Bourbon is the sweetest with nice Vanilla. Sherry is most oaky and a sherry bomb. Vinho Barrique is a happy marriage of both. 
Be warned... after trying these, all other whisky taste too bland."
