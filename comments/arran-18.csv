Finish: sweet, not particularly coating, hints of spice but it long."
4.0,"Meteen een ‘zesty’ citrus geur, anijs, 

Zoet,... voelt alsof hij opwarmt. Geen grote alcohol impact, zee-zout

Tweede neus: rozijnen, citrus, houtachtige honing bitterheid. Chocolate, kaneel

Vrij complex, voelt volwassen aan. Fruitig maar blijft lang hangen."
4.5,"I really wasn't prepared enough for Arran when i tasted the 14yo and i reviewed it with a low score then. This Arran 18yo is absolutely amazing and brings my faith back to this brand.

On the nose is perfect. Blackberry marmalade, COTTON CANDY (wow), Cherry, Honey; just Wonderful.

On the palate, a Honey note. Very Powerful dram as the 14yo, Peppery, tongue makes that ""Crazy Dips feeling"", Prunes, Oakyness, very Complex.

Finish id strong and full of character with ginger notes. Beautifully balanced. 

Overall i give this recommended beauty a 93 over 100."

4.25,"Nose: Malt, rye bread, sourdough bread, walnuts - it's almost like the nose of a full-bodied stout or porter. There are fruity aromas (green apple and lemon juice) but they are dry rather than sweet and absolutely not floral. There are also grassy herbal notes.  It starts off a little reticent but it's a very pleasing nose that develops excellently over time. As it rests in the glass a faint notion of sherry cask comes to mind.

Palate: Sweet, rich creamy malt arrival that is voluptuous and soothing with spices that are warming rather than hot or bright. The development has some sweet stewed fruits and a flinty mineral note. There is a dry foundation under the sweetness that gives everything grip, but the very prominent sweet fruitiness of the earlier 18 year old is not present. Like the nose, the palate brings to mind a full, dark beer made from chocolate-roast malt. The texture is oily, chewy and seductive.

Finish: Medium/long. The crisp malty palate subsides into a sweet aftertaste with the slightest hint of fennel or anise and a drop of lemon juice. The lingering aftertaste is uncannily like a milk stout.

This whisky is the successor to the 2015 Arran 18 Year Old ""Pure by Nature"" expression which was a limited release and the last of a trio of special releases (16, 17 and 18 years old).  The earlier whisky was markedly different to this one, being much more overtly sherried and stewed-fruit sweet, like a more mature version of the 14 year old.

In contrast, this superb whisky wonderfully showcases the mature malty side of the Arran distillate. I don't know the precise cask combination but I'd guess there is a focus on refill bourbon with a smaller proportion of refill sherry casks. The oak influence is restrained for an older expression and the malt does all the talking here. Unlike the 14 year old this is most decidedly not a sweet fruit basket. The focus here is squarely on the malty character, and it is far more reminiscent of heavy ale or stout than sherry. There are constant reminders of Belgian dubbel Trappist beer.

The addition of water slightly emphasizes the grassy, herbal notes but on the whole I think it spoils the whisky. This is quite delicious neat, and best taken that way.

""Very Good, almost Excellent"" : 4.25 stars"
