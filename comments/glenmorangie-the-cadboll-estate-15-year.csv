null,"Not a review but a comment on the latest evidence that supplies are catching up with demand as inventory matures, creating room for lower prices. Per Whisky Advocate: “The Cadboll Estate is priced about 15% lower than the Private Edition releases, and it’s likely significantly more aged... I suspect the distillery has an ample stock of well-aged single malt and a solid plan for keeping pricing competitive even as tariffs and Brexit are causing a lot of uncertainty in that area.” I’m planning to sit out most of the new releases this year and try to make more of a dent in my existing collection, in the expectation that the market is only going to get better for buyers next year and beyond."
