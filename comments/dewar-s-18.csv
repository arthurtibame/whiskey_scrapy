3.75,"Letting this sit for 6 months in a 7/8th full bottle improved it immensely.
The turpentine and astringent notes from the first tasting are gone.
This is a subtle and delicate whiskey. The honey and floral notes on the nose are complemented now by some cereal grains, the palate is silky, oily and coating with malt and heather, the finish is long, smokey and warming."

Upon first blush... It wasn't the light touch 12 year old I was looking for and I was disappointed.  

But eventually I came to appreciate for what it is.  A superb richer blend full of nuance and flavor."

3.0,"The alcohol and turpentine mostly overpower the delicate honey and floral notes on the nose, smooth, rich, oily malt on the palate, the finish is a bit rough with turpentine and astringent notes. I hope this improves over time."
