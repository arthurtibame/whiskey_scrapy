4.5,One of my new favourite Islay whiskeys love the different combination of barrels making this truly unique flavours of apricot spic and a dry red wine followed by a creamy peat that lingers really I pressed especially that it is around $100 cad !

4.75,"Nose: A really beautiful smoky nose. One of the best I've encountered. Also a scent of muted brine - not a breeze but the scent of the beach as the tide is just ebbing. Some warm rich cereal maltiness to provide body, some mild citrus and berry fruits, an oily vegetal aroma (pine? freshly felled oak?). A wonderful performance - smoke, malt and fruit play a trio in a seaside pavilion by a forest.

Palate: A sweet and spicy arrival that rises to within just a fraction below hot. Full but gentle smokiness, toffee, star anise, a little black pepper, apples, sweet lemon zest, and a seaside brininess.

Finish: Long, with mild chilli or pepper and some sweetness. A little citrus and a sweet spiciness reminiscent of pastis in the aftertaste.

Perfectly balanced at 50%abv, this whisky is wonderful neat but it can take a little water for a softer presentation that is frankly even more enjoyable, and highly recommended. Don't drown it, just a dash is all that is needed. This enhances the smokiness on the nose and melds the other aromas together quite wonderfully. It also brings out a previously shy honey note that moves to centre stage, like an unexpected guest soloist.

On the palate, water works a similar transformation, uncovering a sweet citrus flavour from the lemon zest and merging the spicy notes. Also a new smoky and slightly oily component  arises from seemingly nowhere. The mouthfeel and whole presentation is raised a notch, and the finale gains a softer honey-like sweetness.

This is a thoroughly enjoyable whisky - highly recommended and the best new thing I've tasted in a while. In my opinion Port Charlotte expressions are more nuanced than Octomore and represent better value at half the price (although Octomore still commands the high ground as far as intensity goes).

Probably hard to find now, except via auction.

""Excellent"" : 4.75 stars"
