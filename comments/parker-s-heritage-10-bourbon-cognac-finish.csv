4.0,"COLOR - dark for its age; mahogany or pecan tinted and clear.
          
          NOSE - molasses, cherries and candied orange peels; heavy cognac smell for the 4 months Parker Beam said it aged (vs the 6 months noted on the bottle); smells more like a dessert wine than a bourbon, overall quite pleasant.
            
          TASTE - after you get past the sweet nose and turn this over on the palate, this turns back to its roots; the cognac is still present but it tastes like whiskey - high smoke, scotchy; hot but oddly enough not sweet or cinnamon hot; oak and rye are highlighted.
            
          FINISH - slow, lingering finish; not harsh but not overly smooth; light cinnamon heat and stewed plums.  Afterward, the glass smells like dark chocolate covered, dried cherries.
          
          OVERALL - this is a unique pour and is certain to be well-liked or even adored by the general whiskey lover.  To the bourbon purist, this is not a bottle I would recommend purchasing - it has too much of a cognac influence and there are better ""bourbon"" investments to be made.  I do recommend tasting to anyone who gets the chance as it is a complex and very well done whiskey."
