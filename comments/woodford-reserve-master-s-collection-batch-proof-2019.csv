5.0,"First off, I love woodford. I love their rye, their regular bourbon, and their double oaked is amazing. I grabbed the 2018 batch proof last year but didn’t want to open it yet. Found the 2019 recently and for the derby decided to pop it. And just wow... I love barrel proofs and this one is no different. A bomb of cherries right in your mouth. Now the proof shines through and so it’s super hot. But it’s just so good. 5/5 for me. I paid $130 and that’s the most that I’d pay for this (and most bourbons) but I love it"

5.0,I have a bunch of great bourbons and this one tops them all. It’s crazy good.  I get some unique flavors in this one and my palate is not set up for all the descriptions you read on the reviews. It’s just an amazing bourbon.  Not sure it’s worth the 130 but if the MSRP was 80 this would go for 200 on the secondary market.

4.75,A very smooth bourbon even though it is batch proof.
4.5,"I enjoy the Woodford Reserve line of products. I love barrel proof or batch proof bourbons. I understand there is an art to blending bourbons but give me the true product and let me change it. The batch proof is at 123.2 proof. Uncut The aroma is sweet and the taste is enjoyable with no water or ice. Add a small ice cube and candy apple aroma comes out. This bourbon is truly great. 

Now the price was $130, over price yes but you are paying for the name. Overall if you have the money go for it and you will enjoy every sip."
4.5,So good! Wish it were cheaper though.

3.75,"I’ll give this a 3.75 just from reading some of these reviews and that’s on the high end.  It’s good, not great.  Def hot, short to medium finish and don’t get the cherry.  Maybe I got a bad bottle but for those looking at good, affordable, available,  stick with  ECBP, Old Forrester 1920, Knob Creek Single Barrel to name a few all at $49-$59.  If this was in similar price range would give a 4.5 review but at $129 expect a lot  more (shocker).  Cool bottle shape for my bar though, too bad I prefer to drink it..."

5.0,"Wow wow wow, this is just incredible. Deep, dark fruits on the nose follow through to the palette, with rich vanilla and that wonderful Woodford oakyness. Finish is long and sweet. My favorite bourbon so far this year!! Definitely going back to grab a second bottle as a back up. Worth every penny!!"

4.5,I can’t say that I am a huge fan of original Woodford but this is an excellent full proof bourbon. Goes in a bit warm but smooths out on the finish. Lots of flavor. It’s not needed but adding a little bit of water cooled it off nicely and brought out a myriad of different flavors that weren’t readily apparent on first taste.

5.0,"If you ever see this bottle out in the wild, grab it no questions asked..."
4.0,"Vanilla and Cherries on the nose, and palette is vanilla, cherries and brown sugar.  I am not a huge WR fan, but this Barrel Proof is delicious!  Nice long finish!  I wish it were a $100 bottle or less."
5.0,Fantastic.  One of my favorites.  Nose of bananas and juicy fruit.  Very sweet and not as hot as you'd think.  Would recommend

4.25,"A higher proof, slightly less oaky version of double oaked that is superior in every way. A good bottle for sure. Especially if you love Woodford."
4.5,"Miles ahead of it's lower proofed brethren, in my opinion.  Great example that shows just how much proof matters.

Nose: vanilla, maraschino cherry, oak, roasted peanuts.  Navel orange off in the distance.  The proof shows up big-time.

Taste: oak, caramel, vanilla, tannin, barrel bite.  Classic bourbon but turned up to 10.  Peanuts on the finish.  Alcohol burn.  Oil and alcohol linger on the palate.  Unroasted peanut on the finish.  Almost some coffee and almond characteristics way at the end of the finish.

Some drops of water brings out some brightness in the nose.  Citrus punches through some more.  Palate gets fruity - almost like grape, banana, with brown sugar along for the ride.  Tamps down the burn a little.  Coffee note now accompanied by dark chocolate.

Really enjoyable.  Fun to explore with water.  Classic bourbon with some hidden tastes if you want to explore.  Just as good if you don't."
4.0,"I will confess that I am not the biggest fan of Woodford. For the most part I find their expressions to be fairly bland and straightforward. The Woodford malt I did quite enjoy but outside of that I would spend my money elsewhere. So that brings me to this release which is essentially a cask strength version of the Woodford Reserve Bourbon. It comes with a very hefty SRP of $130. So with my prior experience I was never going to fork out for a bottle. When my local Whisky bar got a bottle curiosity got the best of me and I sprung for a pour. Lets see if its worth it:

On the palette its very rich and suprisingly very easy to drink for 123.2 proof. Initially you get a rich burnt brown sugar note that's complemented with cinnamon roasted almonds. Leather is also evident pretty early on. Lovely entry and leads to a long finish that is more of the same adding oak and butterscotch with cinnamon spice. 

All in all I am actually really impressed with it and if it where priced in the $70 range I'd for sure buy it. Its definitely worth that, however $130 for me is just too much for what you get. Fans of Woodford will no doubt love and be able to justify the cost. For all others I'd recommend buying a pour for sure and then judge if its worth a bottle purchase. Act fact as these bottles are pretty allocated and will be very hard to find soon. Cheers all!"
5.0,"Yep, it's that good. Freaking delicious. Maple syrup mouthfeel, and that deep dark cherry on the palate. Just get it. Yes expensive, but I do think it's twice as good as rare breed, ECBP, and Booker's."
4.25,Classic bourbon flavors all the way.  Drinks much smoother than proof would suggest.  Mid palate is a deep cherry rounded off by vanilla.  Finishes a long that line leaving the oak presence behind.  Very nice spend some time with this one very enjoyable.

4.0,"Color: Dark amber.

Aroma: Toasted oak and nuttiness with hints of vanilla and caramel.

Taste: Batch proof make itself known as soon as it hits your tongue. The charred oak carries over to the palate and gets hits of cinnamon and peppery spice.

Finish: There is a good amount of warm cinnamon and toasted nuttiness on the back end. Not sweet, but not too powerful for a batch proof.  Can be consumed neat.

A little water opens up sweeter notes of honey and vanilla ice cream.  There is a tiny amount of sweetness that carries over to the palate but that cinnamon spice is still prominent.  The long finish is accentuated with water and becomes more complex."

5.0,"Smooth.  That is what immediately comes to mind on the nose of brown sugar. First sip is almost syrupy as the flavors seem stronger than the liquid can handle.  Vanilla, butter, and brown sugar wash over as a long lasting burn builds and simmers on your tongue.  This is fairly spectacular stuff."

3.0,"Just not as good as the Old Carter, deeper chocolate notes on the mouth. That said, it was still a great taste despite being 120+ proof.

(Drug City Tasting Room)"
2.5,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""whiskey transfer program"".

Nose: Quite a bit of ethanol punch, heavy vanilla, apple, and raisin.  Some background oak and mint.  

Flavor:  Very sweet but a lot of barrel bitter up front which I found a little off putting.  Otherwise vanilla and brown sugar and nothing else seemed to come through the bitter notes.

Finish:  Heavy leather and tobacco with rye spice.  A ton of barrel bitter that overwhelms everything else.

I don't think that Woodford made a good choice making this such a high proof as some gnarly flavors are coming to the forefront.  Kind of disappointing."

3.75,"Nose: Banana, sandalwood, cherry, light hints of mint and caramel, nutella and a beautiful rich brown sugar.

Taste: Hits hard, burned my ears a little. Pecan. Cola. Banana bread. After opening up, you can start to get some big flavors of vanilla and baking spice. 

Finish: SPICE. You get a deep Kentucky Hug, but some of those fruit elements from the nose show...the cherry and banana linger. 

Overall: Normally, I’m not a huge fan of the heavy-hitting proofs. I tend to stick in the 100-110 range. With that being said, this is a really nice high-proof bourbon that is as pretty as it is aggressive. Some incredibly deep flavors. And it’s extremely cohesive from start to finish. Makes me wonder what a BiB Woodford would taste like. 

Value: I got this from a friend. I’ve spent more than $130 or so on a bottle before, and I totally get why the high-proof fans would LOVE this. It’s not my personal preference, however. I’d rather spend half the price on an EH Taylor or a 1920 OF. But if high proofs are your thing, then I think you’d have a lot of fun with this. Happy I tried, but not a purchase for me."
