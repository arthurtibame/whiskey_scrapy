4.0,"Smoke, peat, sea, brine, leather are immediately apparent on the nose.  Faint amount of vanilla sweetness is in the mix.  A damp, cool day by the ocean beach near a fire is an image in my mind when I take in the aromas.  The longer it sits, the smoke fades and it becomes much sweeter and saltier.  Smoke then heat arrive on the palate with a slight amount of caramel and coconut sweetness.  Oaky dryness envelopes all around. A full-bodied, heavy and somewhat oily textured spirit.  A splash of water sweetens the dram and eases the burn and brings out a rubbery note.  A long-lasting finish of cigar and pepper and lemon peel, though it may sound off-putting, is rather enjoyable. Am I at the beach house, enjoying the sunset, just having finished my cigar?  Oh, wait!  I'm in my living room on a cold and wintery evening (by a nice warm fire).  A complex, long and satisfying dram, with a touch of youth.  Wonderful! [$59][92/100] [Opened 1/9/15; Revisited: 2/14/16]"

4.25,"Pale golden color; on the nose, intense peat smoke, carrying with it a lovely flowers-by-the-sea sensation (citrus floral?) and polished leather; explosively flavorful — sea salt, pickled herring, seaweed, char, toasted coconut, citrons, caramel cream maybe — and it coats the mouth with a smooth oiliness. The finish is bright, smoky, and quite dry. The aftertaste brings around the malt. Complexity beyond comprehension, but all the more enjoyable. This one is like the patch of clear, soaring sky that interrupts the rain clouds. An outstanding bottle of Scotch."

3.0,"On a Bruichladdich masterclass I had the opportunity to compare both the Port Charlotte Scottish Barley with the Port Charlotte Islay Barley. While they’re both great drams, I’m now absolutely convinced that terroir matters.
While they’re both obviously very similar, the Islay Barley definitely has the edge here. It’s slightly fresher (nonetheless the peat and smoke), it tastes more nutty, and has a tad more balance in general, but especially in the spices. The Scottish Barley actually appears a bit subdued when compared directly, but I honestly doubt wether I could single one of them out as being distilled with either Scottish or Islay Barly in a general comparison. All in all, they’re both very nice drams!"

2.0,"When I spotted this one on the shelves of Milroy's in London, I was excited to try it.  Although I've tried multiple expressions from most of Islay's distilleries, I've had a harder time finding and trying Bruichladdich's whiskies.  The peat reek of the nose is virtually overwhelming, but it's not typical for Islay scotches.  There is no smokiness to it, just a distinct, almost fungal or mossy smell, like raw mushrooms and rich forest soil.  It reminds me of the mink oil used to restore the suppleness of leather, which, to be honest, is not my favorite scent.  The taste has a citrus malt combination that's a familiar signature of other Islay distilleries, particularly the nearby Kilchoman.  But that oily, almost pungent peat still expresses itself strongly.  Overripe banana or compost are the unflattering descriptors I'd give this flavor.  That note is so strong that it dominates the finish for me, along with some bitter oak.  I did not like Octomore 07.3, and, sad to say, I'm not a fan of Port Charlotte either.  It may just be an acquired taste."

4.0,"It's good, and I dare not say this wasn't enjoyable, but the Islay Barley is a better expression. Here is a much more subdued whisky, with a nose that is regretfully quite weak. Regardless, with enough strain one can tease out hints of honey and phenolic compounds. The texture, body, and finish are unfortunately weak, with a rubbery finish. It all sounds negative, but it gets 4 stars because I did not find myself ambivalent as to its flavor. Rather, I much enjoyed it. Cheers!"
3.0,"Bold, earthy and medicinal nose from the generous amounts of peat, with the smell of dried wine skins coming through before you take your first sip. Vanilla and toffee sweetness make a surprise appearance, giving this whisky a smooth and silky mouthful. Unfortunately, the finish is very short."

4.0,Best to let it breathe a little before tasting. It starts out with floral notes. Then you get so real barbecue and then finishes off with some real spice. There are big notes of clay and minerals. Not sure I like that. I have to admit that the complexity grows on you. It seems every time you taste it something different comes through. Definitely worth a try.

4.0,"It's time for a wonderful whisky tasting flight from the fine lads at Bruichladdich, on the island of Islay.  I'm enjoying the Wee Laddie Tasting Collection from these guys, which contains 3 200ml (8oz) samples of their core offerings:  Classic Laddie, Islay Barley, and Port Charlotte Scottish Barley Heavily Peated.  To run the entire gamut I've also opened a bottle of Octomore 7.1, in a valiant effort to go from unpeated all the way to the most heavily peated whisky in the world.

Onto the Port Charlotte Scottish Barley Heavily Peated.  As the name implies, this one is peated to a level of 40ppm.  It's non-chill filtered and (again) comes in at a rounded 100 proof.  It's a straw yellow in the tasting glass and really sticks to the walls of the glass instead of getting all leggy.

On the nose, there's a nice salty peat presence that overshadows most everything.  There's a significant charred barrel presence here and even a hint of lemon if you really get down in it.  But that peat, oh baby!  To say that my heart resides on Islay isn't just a cheesy line, it becomes more and more true with every peated whisky I drink.

On the tongue, there's a balance of peat and briny sea salt that evolves into a burnt and smoky campsite fire.  The zesty lemon peel helps keep things from feeling heavy as the finish rolls through with more earthy peat and toasted oak.  It's very smooth and mouth watering.  More more more.

Overall, this is a brilliantly balanced whisky that isn't overwhelmed by high phenolic levels of peat and that makes it work so damn well.  The true definition of an Islay whisky.  Cheers"

4.0,"First impression on the nose is a tire fire...but in a good way! That certainly dominates but after the initial peat hit, there's a definite lemon and herbal quality. The palate has much more of the same, with a salted pretzel edge. The peat presence in this dram is more rubbery and medicinal rather than the campfire and bacon fat you get with other Islays. More of the oak barrel comes through on the back end, and the finish is fairly quick. I enjoyed it, though I prefer more of the barbecue and wood smoke qualities in peated scotch. This would be a challenging beginner peated scotch, but absolutely worth your time to try if you prefer that medicinal, petroleum quality to peat."

3.5,"Nose: a tad muted in terms of complexity. Mostly delicious but not overpowering peat smoke with lemon cream and generalized citrus.

Palate: now we’re cooking with gas. The mouthfeel is generous and mouth-coating with a medium viscosity. The strong peat smoke steps a bit aside for sweets: caramelized sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, along with some slight floral and herbal notes popping through.

Finish: the wood spice really shows itself here in the malty, drying, balanced medium finish. The sweets stick around and blend nicely with some tart, juicy red fruits, too, along with a dusting of pepper right at the end.

Final thoughts: very drinkable. Being Non-chill filtered, naturally colored and 50% abv, this malt from Bruichladdich checks a lot of boxes despite being an NAS. Even as a fairly well-seasoned peat head I’m really enjoying this dram. True, it’s not overly complex, but if you’re looking for a well-balanced peaty pour that you don’t have to think too much about and aren’t craving that Laphroaig/Ardbeg peat punch in the face, grab a bottle of this stuff and sip in peace."

Adding water opened nothing but a hint of citrus and grassy notes, but I really had to search for that."

4.0,"The name pretty much says it all: Heavily Peated. Now, if you’re like me and love peated whiskies, then you’ll love this offering from Bruichladdich. The standard Bruichladdich is unpeated, which allows full access for the sea salt notes and earthiness and fruit to come through. This isn’t that. The peat is quite strong and subdues any other flavors. Now I will say that if you have the “Classic Laddie” before trying this, you will pick up a lot of the underlying notes in the Port Charlotte. And once you do that you’ll always be able to spot them which makes this whisky better. So the fruitiness is there if you look for it and the nose has this floral sweetness that is nice. Now, when you heavily peat a whisky, you better know what you’re doing and Bruichladdich definitely does. For anyone who loves Islay whiskies knows that each distillery offered a different smoke profile in their whiskies. In this heavily peated whisky, Bruichladdich seamed to capture the essence of each one. You get that bright campfire smoke from Ardbeg and Laphroaig, hearty and sweet peatiness from Lagavulin and Caol Ila, a fruity smoke from Bowmore, and a youthful herbaceous smoke from Kilchoman. This whisky truly does capture the peatiness of all Islay whiskies while throwing in some of its own flare in the fruity undertones."

Smoke for days. Brown sugar basted Smokey beef. Oxidised copper pot.
There’s a strong musty smell of old books and leather too. Aroma has a strange sweetness you get from raw beef. 
New car leather seats late in aroma
Strange sweet nappy (not used)
smell. Epoxy resin Sour worm lollies

The palate is youthful, spicy with vanilla, honey, and light apple or sweet apple. The palate has more peat for me than the nose but also carries a little salt and some bitterness. It coats very nicely and has me trying smaller tastes to just enjoy that feeling. The finish is smoke, peat, char, and then some sweet sugar. This is a solid scotch, but it did not live up to my expectations. With age to take off the sharpness in the nose and the bitterness in the finish, this would be exceptional."
3.75,"Peat and smoke on the nose. The same on the taste, but as for me a little bit hard to swallow 50 abv. Good example of a real islay scotch."
4.0,"Part three of the Wee Laddie tasting set. 

The third and final whisky in the Bruichladdich tasting set is the Port Charlotte Islay Barley. For those of you who may not be all too familiar with Bruichladdich, let me break it down for you. The Bruichladdich distillery produces 3 different lines of scotch whisky. Anything that is strictly Bruichladdich is unpeated, Port Charlotte is heavily peated, and Octomore (which sadly is not included in this set) is super heavily peated. Just think of it like Ford Motor Company circa 2000. They had 3 brands, all made by Ford. Bruichladdich would be Ford, Port Charlotte would be Mercury, and Octomore would be Lincoln. But I digress. 

So back to the whisky. This Port Charlotte has been peated to a level of 40ppm, is bottled at 50% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of yellow gold. 

Sweet, peat, and sweet peat on the nose. Lemon citrus, almonds and almond butter. A big hit of smoky, vinegary BBQ sauce, BBQ ribs and smoked fish, salmon mostly. Fairly salty, maritime/sea air and green olives. A touch medicinal with iodine, but nowhere near Laphroaigian levels. Vanilla, grilled apricots and nectarines, a definite sweetness behind all the smoke. Barley sugar, yellow apples, fruit/spice cake, butterscotch and toffee. A slight minerality and some sawdust. Floral notes with dry grass and a hint of red wine. So far this is the best nose of the 3. 

The palate is strong and peppery, youthful. Peaty, smoky, ashy, charred oak pulled from a bonfire and doused with sea water and damp earth. Slightly fruity - apricots mostly with some light lemon. Heat at times, not too complex, mostly those peaty notes. Green oak, medicinal and barley sugar. Caramelized/burnt sugar, cinnamon, ginger and graham crackers. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is creamy, mouthwatering and mouth coating. 
The finish is long, peaty, ashy, slightly fruity - mostly lemon, and dry. 

I think this one edged out the Classic Laddie for the top spot in the tasting set. It might not be quite as nuanced, especially in the palate, but the peat adds a much needed contrast to the overly malty profile of both the Laddie and the Islay Barley. Still, for my money I’d rather buy a Laphroaig or Ardbeg if I wanted to go with heavy peat. A solid 4 though.

4.75,"Luscious fruit and rich oak on the nose with an interesting nod to the Campbeltown funk for no particular reason. The peat is prominent but not overwhelming. Palette confirms the nose and provides a huge finish, an effervescence and tremendously satisfying all round experience."
4.0,I like this a lot but not nearly as complex as the PC10 finished in wine casks. This is more a straight up classic Islay scotch. Still excellent.
4.0,Very evident peat notes with lightly oak undertones. Slightly caramelized and smoky taste. Very smooth for a 50% ABV whiskey.
4.5,Very light smoke on the noise. At first taste light notes of barley peat and sea salt. After taste of carmel lemon. Very complex

4.25,"Ok, i hated the Bruichladdich classic laddie. This is another thing. A very different one. 

This is not as heavily peated as other heavily peated whiskies and it is super pleasant in the palate.

Bottled at 50%abv.

On the nose is peated but not a super bomb. Its fairly peated, with Grapes, burnt cake crest, plum, heather and ""shoe box"" notes. Nice. Interesting.

On the palate starts sweet with orange, toffee and coffee, to release a spice pepper bomb, with earthy-heathery peat. 

Aftertaste is long, salty and sulphur. Gunpowder, spent fireworks. Amazing.

Overall i originally gave it a 91, but i think that is way too much. 89 over 100 is a good score to keep it in the 4.0."
