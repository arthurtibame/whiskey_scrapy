3.0,"Nose - Standard vanilla, caramel, hint of cloves, faintly nutty, lightest hint of cherry cough syrup.
Taste - Pleasant cinnamon tinted vanilla, thin caramel sauce, light oaky sweetness like that of a barrel aged simple syrup.
Finish - Light oaky sweetness with residual cinnamon heat, light diluted oaky simple.
Score - 72/100
Final Thoughts - This is a very ""run of the mill"" bourbon. It smells like a bourbon, tastes like a bourbon, it must be a bourbon. Nothing about the nose, taste, or finish really stand out. They predominate feature seems to be the cinnamon spice heat you initially get on the tongue, but that quickly fades. It's not great but there's nothing really off putting about it either. There are plenty of others I think I'd much rather reach for before this on my shelf and I think this will be my last, especially considering the price tag for it."

3.0,A decent nose but lackluster flavor profile. This might be a good one for a beginner. I’d be curious to see what the barrel proof version of this tastes like.
4.0,"Yellowstone Select
Classification: Kentucky Straight Bourbon
Proof: 93 (46.5%)
Age: NAS
Mashbill: Undisclosed
Distillery: Limestone Branch Distillery, Lebanon, KY
Price: $35 - $50
Color: Dark Amber
Nose: Vanilla, touch of leather, caramel, smallest hint of smoke, hint of corn after being in the glass for a while
Palate: Sweet, caramel, rye spicy, rich & oily, touch of oak, subtle dark fruit
Finish: Medium-Long, brown sugar, oak, baking spices, black cherry, lingering heat in mouth
Personal Rating: 6.5/10
Notes: Not a bad pour really, but doesn’t stand out as immediately memorable. I didn’t pick up on the cherry notes immediately, but after sitting in the glass for a bit they started to come out. I’ve heard that some folks are paying $50 for this bottle, but I paid $35 at Binny’s here in the Chicago burbs. I’m not mad about it, I think that $35 is a good price for what I have here: a standard, decent, easy to drink bourbon. The packaging is neat and makes it seem like it is more exclusive and high-end than it really is, but I won’t fault them for that. Basically, enjoy this bad boy anyway you like: neat, rocks, cocktail, etc. With the sweetness and hints of cherry, it probably wouldn’t be a bad idea to use it in the kitchen either"

2.75,"Happy Thirsty Thursday Whiskey lovers! Today's dram comes to us courtesy of the Limestone Branch Distillery (50% owned by Luxco) in Lebanon, KY. This particular bottle comes from the maiden batch bottled in 2015. It's a blend of 4 and 7 yr old high rye (mashbill undisclosed) Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Source undisclosed). It's bottled at a decent enough 93 proof.
I have had the pleasure of sampling their Limited Edition expressions (2015, 2016 and 2017) and have found them to be enjoyable (but overpriced for what you get). When originally released this one had an SRP of $50 and I was able to get this particular bottle for $38. I have seen it priced typically for between $42-$32. 
The bottle itself comes in a scotch style tube and definitely looks good on a shelf! Let's hope the juice lives up to the bottle. 
On the pallette it enters pretty soft with a dash of black pepper that quickly gives way to cherries an assortment of dark fruits and a hint of toffee. Mid pallette you get a nice caramel note that leads to lots of oak and tannins with a medium rye spice driven finish. It's a bit drying but overall it's in balance and well constructed. It's definitely an easy sipper and not overly complex, however, considering the age you do get a surprising amount of oak. 
The main sticking point is value. When compared with other Kentucky Bourbon's in this price range (Eagle Rare, Four Roses Single, Knob Creek and McKenna to name a few) it doesn't distinguish itself. I would have scored this just north of 3 stars at $30. With the price I paid, it's just under it. I would say if you are curious, don't pay more than $35. It's a poor value at that point. The bottle is cool though! 
Cheers all!"

3.75,"Simple on the front and sophisticated on the backend. This is a very pleasant, easy drinking bourbon. 3.85."
2.5,"Have seen many positive reviews on this so I went ahead and got it for $33 on sale. This is sourced bourbon though they will be producing their own soon. Poured neat, good legs and nice mouthfeel. Nose has vanilla, black cherry and a touch of rye spice. Some heat on the nose but not overbearing. Palate is sweet vanilla with cherry oak, mild caramel nuttiness and heat. Not a lot of body but the cherry vanilla is focused. Finish is medium with spice, oak and lingering sweetness. It runs a little hot as the proof doesn't expand and bloom the flavors just adds heat. My preference leans to the sweet side but would not repurchase. Its not bad, just not enough complexity, balance or depth to warrant price......74/100.....I paid $33 but at $40 or more there are so many better choices for same or less just steer clear imo"
3.75,"Taste:  Binny's Barrel pick #1808591, 4 years old, 1.5 oz neat in Glen Cairn.

NOSE: (3.25)  A bit light on the nose.  Vanilla and caramel corn are dominant but not much else.  The nose is good but there is not enough there to really draw me in.

PALATE:  (3.75)  Palate is good.  Definately above average.  There is pastry with a sort of vanilla cream filling.  Best way to describe is like a boston cream donut without the chocolate topping.  There is some peaches in the background, and a bit of cherry pie on the back palate.  Really nicely done for a younger straight bourbon.

FINISH (3.75):  The oak kicks up a notch on the finish.  A bit of pepper and vanilla carry on. The finish for a 93 proof whiskey is pretty darn good

OVERALL:  This is one that really surprised me, and to the positive side.  There are plenty of good flavors on the palate and nose.  There is a youngness to it, but not that oily creamed corn taste that some new bourbons have.  More of a popcorn ball.  The flavors really play well together.  I think if this was at a higher proof (100 maybe) and was in the oak longer it would go from above average to being a knockout.  I did shy away from the higher proof, older limited release because of price BUT that may have just been what I am after.  And there is the rub.....this was a well picked 4 yr old for 39.00 which is right on the money for what it is.  The limited release however brings you into competition with the big boys, and for that I am really expecting alot.  Big price to pay to take a chance on a sourced whiskey with not alot of time in the market.  For this one though, Binny's really picked a nice barrel to introduce a newer brand in their store, kudos to them.  Limestone Distillery will definately be one to watch.  Steve Beam is definately no slouch in the game and the lineage and know how is showcased here.  This bottle was an excellent bang for the buck, and I wouldn't shy away from buying this one"

Appearance... Dark copper to a light mahogany.  

Taste... It's herbal and grains encapsulated. Rich oats, brown sugar and fresh butter...

Overall... This is French toast and Bourbon. It's as drinkable neat as any bourbon I've had the opportunity to come across. Just fantastic.  

THIS BOTTLE IS A BINNY'S BEVERAGE DEPOT, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, BINNYS SELECT BOTTLE, NOT THE STANDARD ""YELLOWSTONE"" MODEL/BOTTLE..."

3.75,"Yellowstone started in 1872 and Luxco eventually purchased the brand, but the brand’s quality started to decline. In 2015, Luxco purchased a 50% share in the young Limestone Branch Distillery in Lebanon, KY. Stephen and Paul Beam founded Limestone in 2010 but did not have enough mature bourbon for Yellowstone. They used up to seven sourced 7-year-old bourbons for Yellowstone, but by the end of the decade introduced Limestone’s own 4-year-old distillate into the blend. The sources and proportions are confidential, but Heaven Hill is a probable contributor based on their past relationship with Luxco.
Yellowstone bourbon has a roasted chestnut appearance. The nose is brown sugar, caramel, licorice and some rye spice followed by toasted almonds and cinnamon. The taste is complex and reveals the diverse blend of bourbons that comprise the final product. Caramel, honey and butterscotch dominate with hints of toffee, orange and cinnamon. It trails with a medium fruity finish followed by oak and sugar."

What wonders a few days of oxygen did this whiskey! Initially, the nose was VERY closed, but after 5 days how its changed! Baking spices, vanilla and oak pop on the nose, while pronounced flavors of follow suit with a floral notes, honey and a slight herbaciousnes develops toward the end, with a lingering spice on the end. Overall, I'd see this a delicious High-rye bourbon, though when compared to OGD BIB, OGD BIB is the better buy, price point is cheaper and the quality is about equal."
4.5,"Progressive flavor, spicy + honey"

3.75,"Pretty interesting bourbon for being sourced. It's at least 4 years old and on the nose I get brown sugar with light vanilla and creme brulee. Similar notes on the taste with a short to medium finish. Very light spice. The first time I tried this I didn't let it sit but, this time I did to give it a better chance and I would definitely recommend letting it sit. I wouldn't mind having this as a daily sipper. Great price. ~$32"

3.0,"Very caramelly on the nose, cherry notes.

Taste has a heavy butterscotch flavor, which evolves into a caramel flavor. Finally during the finish it’s heavy on the butter. 

Very light mouthfeel, easy to drink!"

4.25,"So its been a while since my last review, but I recently took a flier on a store pick from Hi Times Wine Cellar in Newport Beach, CA and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Enough so that I thought now is a good time to get back into the app and catch up on some reviews I've been meaning to write. 
So now on to the review.  
Their pick of the Yellowstone Select 93 is a 5 year age stated pick and one of the first to be sourced entirely from Limestone Branches own juice.  If this particular batch is an example of what we can hope to expect as their brand continues to mature over the next few years we have found an absolute gem!  The first thing to hit you is the well balanced classic bourbon notes.  This definitely isn't like so many of these new distillers pumping out young bourbon that's been over flavored with different cask finishes, and Frankensteined into something they call bourbon.  No, Its a tried a true old fashion good classic bourbon with no frills.  Vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, and peanut brittle up front, the peanut brittle hangs with you along with black pepper and some orange peel notes until a nice warm finish rounds out the tasting. Everything you could want from a bourbon without breaking the bank!  For 36 dollars this is a fantastic pour that makes you want to order a few more.  I've had the bottle for a little over a week and its has just gotten better with each pour!   

Cheers!"
