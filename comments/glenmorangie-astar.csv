4.0,"I decided to spend my only night off of work this week by riding up to the big city  (Richmond, VA) and hit up my local big whisky bar and grill which, ironically, is called McCormack’s Big Whisky Grill.  A big platter of homemade mac & cheese with pulled pork bbq piled high on top fit the bill for my grumbling stomach and I decided to try this new, NAS Glenmorangie in case I found out it was worthy of a buy.  Much to my delight, call it Christmas spirit, Mac (the owner/bartender) decided to give me the original Astar from 2008 instead of the new release.  A $28 pour (the 2008) for $12 (the 2017) price.  Merry Christmas to me.

This original version was matured in ex-bourbon casks from the Ozark Mountains of Missouri.  There’s no indication which bourbon distillery they were sourced from but if the nose is any indication I’d guess they were possibly from Four Roses.  The nose here is amazing:  tropical fruits, marzipan sweetness, very perfume-y before revealing lightly toasted oak.  I could smell this one all day long and be delighted.

The palate is initially buttery smooth.  Orange cream and vanilla start things out very well- almost dessert-like.  But then a wonderful, hot cinnamon note appears and puts the entire palate experience in check.  There’s a bit of harshness as it finishes.  The finish is medium in length, oaky and sweet.  I feel like some caramel or toffee rounds out the final tasting notes and leaves you really satisfied and happy.  If all NAS whiskies were like this one I don’t think you’d hear as much complaining- I’d certainly welcome them with open arms.

All this said, I have to say this may end up being my favorite Glenmorangie to date.  I haven’t been a big fan of this distillery but this one certainly changes my overall take.  Now I have to begin searching for the older bottles of Astar so I can add 1 to my collection.  I hear they are going for somewhere north of $200.  The new release is close to $100, so maybe I should give that one a try to see if they reclaimed any of this 2008’s glory.

As is, this bottle is a resounding 4.25-4.5 stars.  If you see it out in your travels I’d recommend giving it a try.  Solid, good stuff for sure.  Cheers, my friends."

nose: peaches and cream, very sweet and pleasant
profile: easy drinker, very sweet with some nutty notes to follow. not a long finish, but for a scotch, unlike anything I've ever had. add a drop of water, you get a nice black tea flavor right on the front."

4.0,This is the way single malt scotch should be enjoyed. Non-chill filtered bottled at a proof worthy of sitting and letting the whisky develop a tune of its own. This is made to be enjoyed a dram at time quietly and with much reflection to the men who made it possible for the small moments you'll remember and smile about after a rough day. Please refrain from making this something it isn't but imbibe and realize this is what life can be cracked up to be if done correctly.

3.5,I really wish I liked this at the distillery it was rare and priced well and cask strength but had a very forward burn not just an after burn medicinal would have liked to try it with water but ended up with the Duthac 1 litre for a little less and tasted way better

4.25,"I like Glenmorangie for the diversity of their whiskies. This one is a rare and special drink.  This whisky is sweet and fruity, like pears or apples and spicy. For a 52.5% ABV (2017 version), the finish is smooth and lasting.  I think this is an excellent after dinner whisky, a whisky to share in special occasions.   Marvelous."
