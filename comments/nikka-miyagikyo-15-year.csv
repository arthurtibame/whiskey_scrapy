3.0,"Reminiscent of a par Speysider. Light and malty, with notes of citrus, toffee and manuka honey on the nose. A toffeed sweetness appears first on the palate, followed by a dash of salt. Wood spice is much more evident on the palate than the nose, and the oak takes over into the finish."

4.0,"A fresh, clean whisky with forward notes of coffee, vanilla, and toffee. The finish is sweet and subtle, with oak and cereal surrounding the tongue. Not as complex as I would like, but what it does, it does well."
