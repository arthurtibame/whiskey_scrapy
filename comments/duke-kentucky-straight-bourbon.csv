5.0,"Now this is a well made Bourbon for all lovers of The Special type of Bourbon that John ""The Duke"" Wayne enjoyed in his day....

88 Proof is a Special Proof that is Lower than 90 Proof & Higher than 86 which makes it very special

I love the thick glass old timey bottle & the Bourbon that comes in in!

Now this is a sipper or on the rocks ONLY Bourbon as mixing it would be a sin!"

2.0,"Just tried my first bottle of ""Duke"" and have to say I'm not impressed. I feel it's overpriced for the flavor. This has an aftertaste that just isn't good. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
2.0,"Not a bad bourbon, but definitely nothing special. I bought this with hopes that it would be really good (for the price) and it was average at best. Chalk this one up to a good marketing campaign. 
Straight forward profile of a young bourbon for this one. Corn, caramel, and rye spice in this one with a quick finish."

2.0,Maybe I was in a bad mood for whiskey but this stuff was just bitter to my palate at the time. I'll try it again to confirm if I get the chance.
2.0,Slight sweet caramel start but finishes too hot

2.0,"At first, seems doomed to be relegated to the world of nondescript whiskey. But after a while it develops some character, some notes that stand out a bit. Overall, mellow, with bitter notes in the backend. It seems like something that may open up with more time and air in the bottle. Not bad, but I would hope The Duke had better in his lifetime. 4/13/17"

3.0,"Look: Burnt orange, lacing and heavy alcohol legs. 

Nose: Get a lot of rye spice and barrel. Slight sweetness but nothing specific. Fairly perfumy 

Palate:  Pepper, rye, oak, pretty typical bourbon notes.

Finish: fairly hot, some corn in the finish

Overall: not really going nuts with this one. No frills bourbon."

0.5,"N: Light honey and fruit
P: Some faint sweetness, very light, no mouthfeel
F: Faint char. As if it got close to a candle at one point in its life.

The La Croix of bourbon. It's as if this bottle got near bourbon and the label imparted flavor. 

It's not good."

2.5,Leathery. Some pepper.
2.25,"Not a fan. Needed more time in the barrel. A relatively light bourbon, lacking depth. This will be a mixing bourbon for me."
3.75,I enjoyed more than the professional did. If you like a sweeter high corn bourbon this is very good.  Smooth with little or no ice/water.
3.75,"Nose: sweet, hay, corn, fall leaves 

Long thin quick legs 

Sweet cherry char flowery fruity

Taste like the country during spring after rain."

2.0,"This is the first Bourbon I regret purchasing. It is overpriced, and really has nothing to recommend it in terms of flavor, nose or finish. Also got a bit of a ""soap"" tasted on the first pour that had a different Bourbon in the glass before this one.

Rinsing the glass and re-pouring fixed that, but there was still nothing to recommend this.  Avoid at all costs."

3.5,"Nice very sip-worthy bourbon, smooth with sweet leather, almost like a sweet macallan scotch but a bourbon."
3.5,"Belated.  Abbreviated notes:

Very light.  Intensely strong tart green apple flavor.  Very gentle oak spice.  Pleasant but an uncommon flavor from bourbon.  Would happily sip again but hesitate before recommending to others.  Price is a bit high for what it is."

3.0,Bought this only bc I’m a huge John Wayne fan. So I had zero expectations. It’s not bad pour but for the money there are much better choices. I will say it has gotten better with some airing out. Good on the rocks.

2.25,"An impulse buy recommended by a local store.  

Nose: Very floral a la Wild Turkey but a background oaky nuttiness that I find pleasant.  A little bit of stewed apple with hints of lemon peel.

Flavor: Not as nice as the nose.  Some sweetness and more floral notes but this is overpowered by young piney whiskey and everything else gets lost.

Finish:  Kind of long and drying with some oak and hints of barrel spices but that young piney whiskey note just lingers and kind of blots everything else out.  

This one has promise but without more time in barrel I'd say it's a pass for me.  Shame.  New whiskey makers need to determine if they want to put out product too soon and risk turning away future customers for when their bottles are released at the right age."
