5.0,"This is by far my favorite “Friday night De-stress” Bourbon. I would almost call it perfection to my novice bourbon tongue. 

‘46 is smooth, smoky, sweet, floral, and downright delicious. I would recommend this for anyone who is getting started in Bourbon and it takes the OG Maker’s Mark up a notch. 

5/5"

4.5,"I have been anticipating this one for a while. Being a huge fan of the regular Maker’s 46, I had to know what the cask strength version would be like. I found a Generations of Proof 3-pack that included this rare cask strength version of Maker’s 46, so I had to have it! This one is 111.2 proof (55.6%abv) Let’s check it out.

The nose has cherries, rich buttery caramel, milk chocolate, cooked plumbs, and leather. Very nice, as expected.

The palate is sweet, medium thickness and slightly drying. There is corn, cherries, rich leather, caramel and freshly baked bread.

The finish has a burn at the top of the throat that goes into a nice hug. There are lingering cherries and caramel that hang out for a long-ish finish.

As I mentioned, I have been anticipating this moment for a while and it did not disappoint! I really hope Maker’s Mark decides to make this a regular offering in their lineup."

4.25,"I'm not going to waste a bunch of time on something this simple: Maker's 46 CS is to Maker's 46 what the 46 is to the regular Maker's Mark.  I prefer it to the standard 46, but only barely as the oak is just a bit more than I prefer.  Works fine with a small splash of cold water. I think the sweet spot here would be a 5-7 year, 50% ABV. Nice effort, and when I can find it for under $40, I'll grab it."
3.75,Oaked up makers cask strength. Heavy vanilla and caramel with a fairly long slightly spicy finish. Nice oily mouthfeel with minimal burn considering the high abv. Not bad but wheaters can be a but boring for my taste.
4.0,Another solid bourbon

2.75,Lovely caramel nose but too rough on the back of the throat to enjoy neat. Tasted at an event marking the launch of an outstanding Maker’s Mark Private Select bottle.
