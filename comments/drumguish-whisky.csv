4.0,"This is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" kinda whisky.  Very young single malt that provides a lot of burn.  It has very deep notes of wood smoke and charcoal.  The finish on this single malt is one of the strangest I have ever encountered; it leaves a odd ""tingle"" on the roof of the mouth for some time after.  Very inexpensive so I would recommend every one try it at least once (if you can find it)."
