5.0,"The nose has aromas of oak, malt, toffee-covered pecans, and butterscotch with a light burn. Mouthfeel was very pleasant, full bodied, mellow oaky, and smooth. Flavors of malt, oak, and a grainy sweetness combined with cinnamon rice pudding, almond water and hints of prune. Rounding out the experience with a slightly dry satin finish warmed by mulling spices and a lingering oak sweetness.

I was able to sample batches 4 and 5 and could taste a real progression in batch 6. For a young whiskey VINN’s entry in the market is quite good if a little oak heavy at times. When crafting cocktails think smooth Scotch or Irish Single Malt, Blood and Sand, Rob Roy or a Rusty Nail."
4.0,"The nose is pretty harsh with chemical fumes at first, but after breathing for a minute or two notes of butterscotch and roasted peanuts show up. It took me a lot of deliberation to pin down the familiar flavor on the palate: kettle corn, or really buttered popcorn flavored jelly beans. Faint hints of peach and vanilla pudding mollify the heat and the mouthfeel is nice and buttery. Overall, this exhibits all the characteristics of a classic bourbon, the last thing I expected. The one I tried is from their fourth batch, which is for all intents and purposes a single casking, with a splash of another casking thrown in to bring it to proof."
