4.0,"Yes, it lives up to the hype. While I didn't get much on the nose besides a delicate lemon scent, there's a whole fruit bowl of citrus in the satisfyingly viscous palate. And wow, that finish. It goes on and on, fades, and then returns, like a trick ending to a song. Picked up a bottle for 35 pounds in the UK but seems to be going for $75 in the US."
5.0,"The nose is like freshly baked shortbread spread with green chilli jam. In the mouth it's Big, incredible mouthfeel for such a pale whisky, peppery, a bit medicinal. It has a lovely subtle peatiness (perfect for those nights where you want a bit of smoke, but not a bonfire).

Massive finish. Up there with the best whisky I've tasted in 2016."

4.0,"It's time to review something from Campeltown's newest, old distillery:  Kilkerran 12 year.  This is their first, traditionally aged statement whisky since reopening the Glengyle Distillery back in 2004.  Most of their releases to this point have been labeled ""Work In Progress"" and were experimental bottlings finished  in bourbon, sherry or port wine casks.  It's non-chill filtered and comes in at 92 proof.  I'm not sure if this bottle is available stateside yet or what the price point may be.  This 2oz sample was generously supplied by Pranay.  Thanks again.

On the nose, there's the usual island whisky suspects:  salt, brine and a tiny bit of peat.  There's loads of vanilla, oak and a beautiful marshmallow note.  The smell is delightful and very inviting.

The first sip reveals a nice citrus bite followed closely by biscuity, dry malt.  There's a delicious wash of butterscotch and vanilla mid-sip with a very faint smokiness.  The finish is long and a bit hot, oily with a lingering lemony citrus note.  It's quite tasty.

Like I said, I'm not sure if this is available in the US yet, but if it is and you can pick up a bottle for a reasonable amount ($45-60) I say give it a try.  I think I'm gonna keep my eye out for some of the Work In Progress bottles and give a few of them a try.  Cheers, my friends"

5.0,"In a time that most distilleries are watering down their product to meet demand and make hay, so to speak.  Kilkerran are new players in the game. Owned by Springbank family, you know quality is important but also they need to get their foot in the door of the market and establish they have a good product. They have done this by releasing an incredible whisky at a very low price. Future releases will unlikely be this good of value. It is a very simple, yet complex and old school whisky.  I get lots of citrus, wax, butter on Toast and after a bit of time the fruits come through.  Just enough peat to make things interesting. Buy it"
5.0,"I've heard really good things from this distillery, and yes....I can say it's all true.  I loved this, right up there with Springbank 10.  It's a different profile than its Campbeltown brethren, but just as good.  I get a faint citrus aroma, then followed by a tsunami of flavor on the palette.  I get brine soaked ship ropes, coal, and citrus.  I get then some floral---specifically jasmine.  The finish is long and satisfying, lingers a citrusy-briny trail.  I think it's fr $60-70...I would say definitely worth it at that price."
4.0,"Another bottle purchased almost solely on the basis of the buzz surrounding it's release. It hits all the right notes for me - the brine & cereal notes I associate with Springbank, with some citrus and the ubiquitous ""dried fruit"". Pepper dominates the finish, but not unpleasantly so. It didn't quite live up to the hype for me, but perhaps that will change as I get further into the bottle. If you dig Springbank's usual bottles, Kilkerran 12 will feel familiar."

4.0,"When I describe a whisky, I typically try include a description of the setting, the scenery, the circumstances, the people, because I've found that all of this contributes to my enjoyment of the pour. But in this tasting there was none of that. Just me and the whiskey, and it was going to have to stand on its own. And that it did, admirably. I noticed first its very pale color and the way it coated the glass - many slow and small legs. My nasal appraisal identified just a hint of smoke, celery and some marshy notes (in a good way). I took my time nosing it because it was so pleasantly ""scotchy"".
Tasting it without any added water, I found it almost explosive on my tongue, with spice notes of mint, anise and basil, with a somewhat oily mouthfeel. ""Young"" popped into my mind. Adding a wee bit of water really changed things up, or maybe it was just a matter of more time in the open glass, but the whiskey offered up so much more for the nose - kind of a buttery sweet rolled oats and caramel corn concoction. And the taste was somewhat sweeter, less spicy, and I was picking up some woody barrel notes. The finish was pleasantly long and tingling.  Dry glass notes were floral.  Thank you so much Pranay for providing me with this opportunity to sample this fine Campbeltown whisky. And my apologies for the delayed posting of this note and its recognition of you generosity."
5.0,"Wow! Just wow! I was not expecting something this well-crafted from such a young distillery. Sure it has the full backing of J&A Mitchell, but this is accomplishment at another level. From beginning to end the whisky enchants your lips and tongue - pears (and crisp green apples) marry sweet peat and honey to offer your nose true complexity. The mouthfeel is oily and full-bodied, with a touch of smoke and saltiness to compliment your first impression. The finish is fairly long and balanced, inviting you for further sips. BUY IF YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON IT!"

4.0,"I finally found some quiet moments this weekend allowing me to really sit to experience the dram.  Unfortunately, finding pensive moments seems to getting tougher.  But, if you are able to find a dram and a moment, grab the opportunity.  (Thank you Pranay for that opportunity).

A lightly golden liquid holds within it a nose that is floral light with a marine brine quality accompanied with a bit of malt, honey, green tea, orange citrus, and lightly toasted marshmallows.  Thoroughly inviting, enticing you to the next level of the experience: the taste.  An initial blast of heat and spice, which takes you by surprise given the gentleness of the nose.  Once past the blast, a clean and light body delivers a sweet touch of vanilla and butterscotch which is countered with by fresh ginger, brine, oak and orange zest.  Slowly, given the time, the butterscotch sweetness strengthens.  A dynamic and lively body.  This dance eventually ends and leaves and long and dry mouth tingling with white pepper, ginger and orange coated, lightly, with butterscotch.

An eloquent and well crafted whisky.  Enjoyable and sophisticatedly pleasant.  The thin body makes it seemingly simple, however there is a great deal happening.  Ideal as summer sipper on a back porch watching a slow sunset (at least what I envision).  [Dry glass: Sawdust][90/100][Tasted: 1/22/17]"

5.0,"Whoa, an almost Talisker doppelgänger! A touch of water's Scotch mist reveals omission of chill-filtration. Very sunny yellow-gold color, hopefully without added color. Extra points: 46% abv. The nose opens with a pall of rich woody smoke hanging over Mossy coastal forest. Baked apples, stewed pears and apricot notes peek out. Full, oily mouthfeel on the palate, sweet and malty with orange marmalade, apricot preserves and a pleasant floral soapiness that accumulates. Finish is very long, starting with a rush of clove and spicy ginger before retreating into smoldering oak. Salutations due to our hellacious Pranay for the sample! I'll be seeking a fifth... Dry glass: sweet buttery malt."

4.0,"Nose: good amount of peat, vanilla, floral, oak, and brine

Taste: same as nose, some peat, oak follow with brine, little pepper and hints of vanilla. Quite oily, thin bodied. Hmm maybe some citrus. The taste is simple yet so beautiful crafted.

Aftertaste: medium long"
4.75,"Nose: A full and satisfying nose that initially presents a soft citrus fragrance followed immediately by a waft of smoke blowing in on a sea breeze. There are earthy, mineral and maritime aromas that are balanced by honey, lemon, vanilla and soft smoke. There’s also a little anise and iodine as well, but faint - just enough to add body but not dominate.

Palate: A lovely peaty and slightly salty arrival. Not briny, just seasoned with salt to the right degree so the smoke gains a modest meaty texture. A little pepper that is balanced by vanilla and sweet malt and fruity flavours.

Finish: Long. Salty/sweet and gently smoky with a touch of spice.

Assertive but friendly, this whisky reminds me a little of Clynelish or Benromach, but most of all of its “godparent” – Springbank. There is the same earthy, vegetal, marine quality but it does this in its own way and is certainly not derivative.  If Springbank burned down tomorrow and all we had was Glengyle I’d be heartbroken, but not in despair.

Probably the most noticeable thing about this whisky (apart from how much Springbank DNA it contains) is its coherence and integration. There is a well-defined character to it that is present right throughout the experience, from first nosing to the lingering finish. It’s something that few whiskies can boast they have achieved, certainly not at the age of 12 years, and to cap it all it is reasonably priced, un-chillfiltered, natural colour and 46% abv.

I first tasted this at a Sydney whisky shop tasting session in February 2017 and immediately bought 2 bottles. I would have bought a case but their stock was limited.

If your taste runs to Springbank, Craigellachie, Clynelish, Benromach, Mortlach or anything similar then seek out a bottle of this. It is a brilliant contemporary take on the Springbank / Longrow style and you will not be disappointed. Easily equivalent in quality to Springbank 10 year old, so I'm giving it the same score, just a fraction short of 5 stars.

This is the first mature expression from a distillery, and a marque, that is going to be a modern classic. You read it here first.

""Excellent"" : 4.75 stars"
4.0,"Thanks to Dreaming of Islay for the sample. Hmmm! This is different than anything else I've ever tried. Nose has pleasant light fruit elements (apple/pear) with a floral hue, but balanced. The peat comes in from the side. On the palate, wow, this is also balanced, most likely due to the fact that they did this justice getting this to 46% ABV. I typically wouldn't like floral notes to a whisky, but the slight smokiness of this with its masterful orchestra of the salty brine seems to give you a nice experience. I've never tried their ""works in progress"" offerings, but this would not make me scared to do so. Water on this will probably kill the smoke, unless you want a fruitier taste. The sherried casks might not be up front here, but I do think that they play an important support role. My God, the buttery finish is neverending, I adore it! Glengyle being a sister distillery to the outstanding Springbank does not surprise me, but can someone please tell me why this one was discontinued? I hope it's just going to be replaced? The theme to this dram should be ""This Modern Love"" by Bloc Party, and thanks to @SolanaRoots for the track recommendation!"

4.0,"The Bottle: ""Medieval Minimalism"" is how I would describe this one.  Very simple clear glass with a label that styles itself in what I can only describe as a gothic fashion.  It's direct and very readable, but it comes off as the kind of label that you would have found in Johannes Gutenberg's office.

In the Glass: Light straw.  Seeing as how this is very much a non-chill filtered and natural color spirit, what you see is pure, unadulterated whisky... as nature intended.

On the Nose: This is where we really start to see the connection to Springbank, Glengyle's sister distillery.  We get that same powerful, savory nose that seems to define the house style for the region.  There's a light citrus in there with a touch of barley sugar sweetness hanging around in the back.  All very well integrated, all very pleasing.  This is not the nose of your grandfather's budget blend, this is the nose of a whisky that wants you to know how well it's been made.    

Taste: A mostly savory arrival that takes a couple of seconds before the development really kicks in with the barley sweetness.  Bitter,  sour and sweet all kind of rolled into one.  For me,  the flavor follows the nose quite well; though it is sweeter than the nose would initially suggest.  The finish is a touch bitter with an astringency that hangs about the tongue in a pleasant way.  The best way that I can describe the finish is like that of a savory citrus rind.  I know that sounds a little ridiculous, but there's this ""thing"" going for this whisky that I'm having a hard time finding the right words for.  You really will get more and more out of, the more you go back to it.  

I find the Kilkerran 12 to be a very well-made and distinctive single malt that is doing a great job of helping to define what it means to be a Campbeltown whisky.  It dispenses with flash, pomp and bluster; instead focusing on boatloads of flavor and a natural presentation.  I haven't tried any of the earlier ""Work in Progress"" bottlings, but now that I've seen what the 12 has to say for itself, I just might."

4.0,"If medieval monks made scotch, it'd be Kilkerran 12.  The monks wouldn't have chill filtering or artificial colors, of course.  And perhaps the more artistic among them would even make a label akin to this elegant, black-and-white statement.  Never change, Kilkerran.  Don't let the ad executives and marketing department corrupt this scotch.  There's a lot to love here on the nose:  tropical fruit, high minerality, earthy peat, soil, vanilla, and sherry.  This scotch is similar to Kilchoman Machir Bay but a little fruitier, and a little less smoky.  It has the earthy, ""farmy"" characteristic that's often associated with Campbeltown scotches.  This is a sweet and floral take on a peated scotch, with a lot of pepper and spice starting in the mid-palate.  It's got a Highland single malt character at the beginning, but those flavors roll deep.  The acidic lemon-lime notes that are common to Islay and Campbeltown scotches stand out immediately, yet this dram shifts between the citrus fruits, sometimes coming closer to grapefruit.  The texture is oily and almost feels like there's some grittiness to it -- not in a bad way, just because some of that minerality carries through to the palate as well.  The sherried finish here is reminiscent of Bunnahabhain 12, but with little wisps of smoke and mint, and a generous shake of pepper.  Fresh green wood lingers the longest.  It has a bit too much of that citrus acid in my opinion, which knocks it down one peg below the Ardbegs and Kilchomans of the world.  That being said, this is a stellar 12-year scotch with an interesting interplay of flavors.  For what it's worth, it also was the biggest hit at a party with a bunch of friends, so Kilkerran hits that sweet spot where a lot of different palates find it enjoyable."

5.0,This needs more time and a bottle(s) to ponder...A nose that reminds me of Highland Park 18 year but more alive and urgent. Peat and heather....citrus and floral honey but also a note of the sea. You get a real  sense of place like few drams just from the nose. Not a huge whisky but when its this good who cares. Oily and refined are my first impressions. Great mouth feel and the taste lingers for a long time. Like I said who cares that this isn't a big upfront whisky. While we are in the middle of a peat arms race (which I'm rather enjoying ;-) ) its also great and timely to see a dram where peat is part of an ensemble cast. Also must be noted this is not heavy in tannin or spice - a touch of pepper may be but the finish is like I said all part of an ensemble performance. Wonderful stuff - one of my all time favourites and thanks to Cascade for turning me on to this. 5 stars or 96 but frankly who cares what the score is just pass me the bottle.

5.0,"What a high quality, old school malt this is. Not overwhelmingly peaty or smoky but well balanced through and through. Quite fresh and zesty on the nose with a good whiff of sea salt and just enough sweetness. The palette is exceptionally diverse: burnt wood, followed by crispy citrus fruit and spicy oak. Sweet peaches linger before the malt gets dryer, almost chalky. The finish is quite long, very dry with salt and sweet licorice. A very well made, fresh and lively single malt that delivers its qualities without unnecessary colouring  or chill-filtration."

An example for the industry. I will leave the tasting notes to better noses, but I find the combination of 70% bourbon - 30 % sherry casks and the fact that it is lightly peated combined with Campeltown's salt spray truly delicious. Considering the price at around 45 euros, this became my favourite daily drinker. Bought a bottle, and immediately ordered a second one. Best value for money Whisky I can think of."

5.0,"This is probably the most interesting whisky I've had so far, and hopefully, I probably don't say that too often. At first, I expected this to be not too atypical from something like as lightly-peated Highland single malt on the nose with some briskety peat on the first whiff of this whisky. Then I noticed that it was pronounced, but then I noticed there were grassy and herbal notes to this peatiness. It didn't take long for me to pick up apples, pear, honey, sugary frosted cake - like a red velvet - and milk that has developed some sweetness halfway towards its expiration date. It's a milky, full bodied whisky from start to finish tasting like apples, pears, and honey after an initial jab of smoked brisket, ending in green apples (skin and flesh) with a delightful malty sweetness that comes off as fruity and cakey, and a tanginess somewhat reminiscent of blue cheese."

4.0,"As a big fan of peat I have noticed my collection was rather lopsided with islay. I decided to rectify that by buying my first Campbeltown. An interesting card was inserted into the whisky tube (is there a technical term for these?) along with the bottle explaining the different colored labels signifying the different age statements. My shop only had the 12 year which corresponds to the white label. 
    
    The first few things I noticed on the nose was sweet peat (apparently I did not branch out far enough), vanilla, rosemary, brine, and lemon. I was surprised not picking up any red fruits as I know this spent some time in sherry casks. The oiliness of the palate was very welcome, contrasting to sweet sugar coated grapefruit with a twinge of green apple and lemon (blink and you will miss these flavors). Finally the smoke and brine swarm the palate with something I would describe as a warm peppered goat cheese on the finish. 
    
    I am very happy with this purchase at $40 and am looking forward to exploring this bottle more. I recommend without reservation and am excited to see Kilkerran release older expressions as time marches forward. I hope to see the price stay reasonable as they will undoubtedly will be praised in the future if this 12 is any indication of the direction the distillery is taking.

4.0,"Kilkerran has been releasing well-received works in progress; undermatured whiskies that can only appeal to the whisky nerd.  This is their first “final” product, a 12 year old blend of their bourbon and sherry matured whiskies.  This is still a work in progress.  This is still undermatured.  This still will only appeal to whisky nerds.

I am a practical whisky nerd.  I know this represents a well-crafted and honest whisky product, but this could be better.  There is no opportunity for Kilkerran to put any makeup on this 12 year old because its oldest whisky is 12 years old.  More established distilleries will use older-than-age-statement whisky to smooth out blemishes and add a certain richness that this Kilkerran lacks.

The nose is so incredibly dry, that I’m shocked it’s from the canonized producers of Springbank, Longrow, and Hazelburn.  There are unaltered esters from the spirit that still dominate the nose.  What this has going for it is the well-integrated peat, and meaty sulphury notes that Springbank does so well.  But the best thing is the viscous palatte.  Like a 35-year old whisky in texture, this tastes almost like an ashy lemon Jell-O.  With that viscosity, you know this can handle water, and I do not know any other 46% ABV spirit that can take as much dilution.

This whisky is rather extreme.  At 12 years old, it is still underdeveloped, and dominated by the spirit.  Somehow, it is so viscous, that it is gooey.  It has some of the unfriendly flavors of Springbank including a Sulphurous funk, and it is not hidden away by fruity sweetness here.  For a very close, but even more extreme example of the Kilkerran 12, try the Signatory Un-Chillfiltered Collection Craigellachie 13 year old.  That one is just missing the viscosity.  I don’t know how this Kilkerran is so oily!  I can only imagine what Kilkerran will become in the next few years.

PRESUMPTIVE MARK: 89/100."

5.0,"This bottle hits many marks for me. The presentation is simple and effective, essentially putting the limelight on the straw-colored liquid within. Speaking of which, it is bottled at 46% ABV, which is a definite plus. It is also uncolored and unchillfiltered, so what you see is what you get. What's not to love?

Nose: Ocean spray and smoke, I also smell the spirit itself, nice and malty.
      
      Mouthfeel: Rather oily. Mouthwatering too!
      
      Palate: Salty and smoky at first. As if I licked a dried rock on the seashore. There is also a minerality that comes with that. A floral sweetness arrives next, reminiscent of wildflower honey. I also taste a bit of pear...perhaps apple too. This sweetness is tempered with an acidic quality, a good amount of lemon. There's a bit of vanilla underneath, and oak spice throughout. Then the influence of the sherry casks arrives at the end, with hints of darker fruits and faint chocolate.
    
    Finish: Medium-long
    
    This is an exceptionally tasty and complex dram. The twelve years of maturation really show! It's well balanced, without being dull or ''smooth''. In fact, I like how it's rather aggressive. The spirit, smoke, and salt dominate, all while letting the rest shine through. It's not the most common bottle (at least where I'm from), so grab it if you can!"
4.0,"I tried a Kilkerran at a Cambletown tasting a while back before I started note taking. I think it was a progress statement. Springbank Green, 18, Hazelburn 12 and others turned up and although I didn't keep notes I did keep ratings and there were a lot of 4's. The Kilkerran wasn't one of them... people raved but I didn't. Fast forward a few years and has my opinion changed? Sweet citrus peat, vanilla maritime flavours a bit like Glenglassaugh Tofa but more character. I like it. It isn't the usual peated whisky I go for but it stays out of the lemony/acidic peat territory nicely. Best on the night just pipping the Adelphi Private Stock (but that is nearly half the price). I'm converted! I reckon 3.75 - 4. It's a bottle I'd like to work my way through at leisure."

4.75,"Another Campbeltown classic. A cousin to Springbank, the Kilkerran 12 Year is and has everything I want in a whisky: a revived distillery rooted in old school practices, non-chill filtered, no color added, fairway ABV, peat, smoke, salt, coastal air. The list of accolades goes on endlessly.

The nose hits with peat first, followed by briny, pickled fruit mixed with malt. But that’s just the smells that are pronounced this time. The last pour was slightly different and the next pour will reveal something unique and different again. It’s all smoky lemon rinds & subtle bitterness on the palate. Complex & intriguing throughout the entire bottle.

Rating: I’m backing the Distiller score of 92. Maybe even 1-2pts higher. At a mid $60s price point, this is a showcase scotch for any whisky shelf. Sophisticated enough for special occasions but works equally well as a leisurely everyday pour. Own this bottle. Cheers"

4.25,"Bought this in November and just cracking it open. Up front I’ll say I’m in between a 4.25 and 4.5 on this not on the low end. Also I’d never heard of Kilkerran until I saw this bottle but, after a quick googling, it sounded wonderful and did not disappoint.
My first experience with Cambeltown was Springbank 12. It was just a taste and it was handed to me with water (it’s cask strength after all but would have been nice to ask 🤷‍♂️) and it was awesome. I’d love to taste it neat (and I’ve since bought a bottle so I’ll be able to at some point). I was hoping this would feel similar to that.
I had that 6 months ago and honestly only remember liking it not exactly what it tasted like. This is peaty but not full on (granted my go to are the big peat smackers of Laphroaig, Lagavulin, Ardbeg and Bruichladdich PC). This might be a good intro to Islay for a newbie.
Sorry for the ramble. Initially poured into a rocks glass. Getting more peat than I expected on the nose. There’s some fruitiness there as well but less pronounced. I originally thought citrus like lime or orange but it could have been lemon. Taste is first peat and then sweetness. Pretty sure that’s vanilla. There are some chocolatey tones too but it’s mostly vanilla. The peat is there but it’s well balanced with the fruity and the sweet. 
A few hours later (after finishing Ralfy’s review) I put some more in a Glencairn glass. Took another sip to affirm the above notes. I then added a tiny bit of water and gave it a swirl before walking the dogs. I got back and the peat was gone from the nose. I’m getting tons of LEMON now. Obvious lemon no more “citrus but I dunno which one.” It’s lemon, lemon juice, lemon zest, even a little bit of lemon pledge 😉. Not really but it’s delightful. Only downside is I MISS the peat terribly because it’s completely gone from the nose. I’m glad I tried it both ways because otherwise I’m not sure I would have enjoyed it as much. I will be messing with the water amounts on this one as I make my way through the bottle. There’s still a little peat and salinity on the palate but it’s toned down a TON. Still a nice balance of peat and sweet and fruit but the water (or this amount of it) knocked it far to the fruit side for me.
This will definitely be a great bottle to have around. I don’t want to always be smacked by Laphroaig but I want SOMETHING and the Glens and the rest don’t give it to me. I may grab another bottle for the bunker"

5.0,"So long anticipated. The whisky’s color is of antique gold, so exquisite that pouring it out of the bottle seems injurious. The aroma is sweet and creamy. Estery notes of honeydew, pear, and sun-ripened wild strawberries dance upward. The peat is discernible as thyme and red raspberry leaf. Beeswax candle reaches the back of the nose. Half an hour passes and I finally take a sip. On the palate this whisky is a wonder. Its oaken foundation is resinous and spice-driven, with clove and nutmeg coming to mind. Delicate notes of tropical fruit are found at the front—more honeydew, papaya, kumquat. Other notes come and go before a salty wave resets the senses: balsamic reduction, more thyme, spiced pear, and the gooey cinnamon at the center of a cinnamon roll? The finish is as complex as everything that has come before, intoxicating the throat and reaching back up to the tip of the tongue. Delightfully spicy and kippery, it is a finish that begs another start. But the glass is empty before I’ve appreciated all the layers this whisky contains. It is the most nuanced and complicated potion of a single malt I’ve ever tasted. With only a few pours left in the bottle, I will be just as mystified by the last as I was by the first."

4.5,"Just beautiful.

Understanding that it's not for everyone, I do think it's a beautiful drink that gets you fully into the transition from medium-peated scotch to the next level.

Nose: A dash of smoke that leads into an abundance of smells: Ripe mango, the ocean, brisket and meaty walnut along with some creamy vanilla.

Taste: Pepper,  cinnamon, vanilla...very traditional flavors. The mid-palate offers up something untraditional though, as I get a brie cheese and orchard fruit. Is this finished with a sherry cask at all? That dried fruit and nuttiness shows up as if there's sherry. Mango again on the taste. That smoke touch gives it a pleasant meat vibe. It all melds together like a bacon-wrapped fig.

Finish: Coats your mouth perfectly. A little tanic dryness, but the fruit elements give it a balancing juicy quality. That subtle smoke and peaty earthiness transitions smoothly to a relatively gentle (but not boring) finish.

Overall: Complex. Cohesive. Accessible enough for someone like myself who's entering the world of smoke/peat-heavy drams...but I'd imagine it can be appreciated by those with super experienced palates given all that's going on here. That's what amazes me: there are so many things happening, but they are balanced and flow into each other beautifully.

Value: At $70, I think this is a brilliant scotch and worth having in your collection (by taste, it hangs with some $90-$100 scotches that I've purchased). it makes me excited to try more Campbeltown offerings."

4.0,"Up until this bottle, Campbeltown was the only scotch region I had never explored. Partly because it’s so small and the number of offerings so small compared to the other regions. Springbank’s bottles always seemed too pricey for my budget. When I found this online for $58, I jumped on it. And I’m definitely glad I did. 

Kilkerran is a recently revived distillery in Campbeltown. This twelve year old is their first “finished product” after having released a number of “works in progress” over the last few years. This whisky is a blend of 70% matured in ex-bourbon and 30% ex-sherry casks. It’s NCA and NCF and bottled at 46% ABV. It pours a pale gold in the glass and produces quick skinny legs with a few water droplets. 

The nose has strong barley, light smoke, brine, citrus/lemon rind. Water tames the slight bit of alcohol and adds a richer tone, like dark malt or honey. Compared to the Islay peat monsters of Laphroaig and Ardbeg this is muted, with just a light smoke and none of the phenols that characterize those drams. 

The palate is much more assertive than the nose. There’s light honey sweetness, hints of biscuity malt, and moderate smoke. Really nice, this is very well balanced. There is not much change with water. 

The finish is moderately long with rich smoke, pepper, and BBQ meats. This is where the 30% sherry finish makes an appearance with lingering hints of dark chocolate and fruits. Unfortunately even a small amount of water almost kills the finish. The finish is the best part of this whisky in my opinion. Skip the water, it really doesn’t need it. 

This is an excellent dram. Nicely balanced between sweetness and smoke and hints of sherry. At $58 this is a fantastic value. I would say this is reasonable up to about $70. Get it if you can. 4/5. Cheers!"

4.25,"This is delicious. The trademark campbeltown mustiness hits the nose and the palate right away. Oily and viscous mouthfeel. Aftertaste of smoked bbq. Dry citrus peels and brine complete the flavor bouquet. 

I’m interested in the 8yr cask strength after this but I’d definitely buy again. 

This is like a poor man’s springbank. Lots of similarities to the SB 10yr but cheaper if not widely available. 

A splash of Water opens up the sweeter elements and mellows and extends the finish. Pepper notes more distinguishable from the heat of the 46%."

I was able to compare this with Springbank 10 and liked this better. The Springbank was very good but the flavors in the Kilkerran just stood out more. I need to try one of the 12 year Springbanks for a true comparison."

Such a good dram overall and great representation from Campbeltown which goes against the grain of the usual norm and has more of an “underground” appeal.

The peat is very controlled and coated in sweetness, great balance. Coal and rotting grass. Salty and heavily smoked meat. 
Some water brings out some fresh ripe pears, yellow apples and a hint of vanilla. The saltiness comes out a bit stronger but is overpowered by the sweetness. The malt is now there as well. a hint of lemon custard and walnut.

Palate:
Intensity and sweetness, by which the peat is covered. Olive oil and a bit of ash. Juicy feeling like a very fatty smoked meat, makes you salivate. 
A few drops of water lets the malt and the wood shine. Pears and walnuts are back in the dance.

finish:
A return of the campfire on a beach. Long finish, smoke tends to last longer in my experience. Gets more meaty with water. 

Overall very complex, layered and changing yet very enjoyable. 
Very good quality/price for a scotch."

Palate leads with lemons, then lemon oil, then a flash of wet hay and finally the smoke appears and carries it to the short, slightly sweet, clean finish.  This is quite good, and something I would gladly drink on a regular basis.  The only problem I have is that Springbank exists, and the 10 yr is cheaper and has many of the same flavors (in different proportion) plus a few more, while for only a few dollars more, the Springbank 12yr CS blows this out of the water. It's good, but I think Springbank does it better."

4.0,"Purchased two bottles. One bottled January 28, 2020, and the second bottled August 14, 2019. Japanese market labels.

First (bottled 28/1/2020): thin body, harsh alcohol, and unexpectedly a medium-heavy peat.  Bourbon casky. Definitely drinkable, but lacking in expected complexity. In a blind tasting, I'd say this was a really good 5 year old whisky. Actually, in some ways it reminds me of Nikka's NAS Yoichi. (3.0 stars for this bottle. I want to give it 2.5, but that seems too low as this is still a quality whisky despite the negatives.)

Second (bottled 14/8/2010): More interesting and more complex. Although there's an odd, discordant stomach acid element to the nose. Body slightly more substantial, although not full (definitely not oily). Light-medium bodied. The peat is still there, but more integrated.  Flavors: Cypress wood, lemon desserts like lemon curd, peat, honey, chalk, hay, dried apricots faintly in the background, coffee or chocolate, corriander seeds, mushroom, herbal soapiness, buttered greens, oak, those ubiquitous cookies in a tin from grandma, lingering cayenne pepper finish. There's also a very light agave nectar sweetness layered with the peat that reminds me of blanco tequila.  (4.25 stars for this bottle).

While good, both bottlings seem like they're missing something. Some flavors are mature. Others are kind of hinted at, yet fall short of being concise or defined. And there's no structured narrative to their succession. All the interesting elements are floating around there, but for some reason they just don't quite jell into a revelatory moment. There's also an unrefined and semi-prominent alcohol burn. 

Certainly worth buying a bottle to try. I think an 18 year old expression will bring the dried apricot notes to the foreground and really make this something notable."

Altogether my feeling is = Meh!   I'll check in another month to see if things have toned down and mellowed out from oxidation."
4.0,"Smoked ham and preserve...  It gets sweeter with water, and turns it into something like a salty and smokier Oban 14.  There is a minimal presence of Campeltown funk, but my mind re-imagines it as the salty aspect of the ham. 

For me, this was the first peated scotch where the nose and palate weren't completely obscured by smoke.  It was also the whisky that introduced me to a savory, meaty flavor profile.  Even though my mind's been made up in regard to Campbeltown funk [I don't enjoy it], this Campbeltown scotch opened the gates for me: to the Islands, Islay, and to peated scotches in general.  I give credit where credit is due.  

But yes, after this discovery I felt like the keys to Hades had been handed over to me by the boatman of the dead.  And, oh boy, the lord of the underworld had better hide his liquor.

4.0,"I don’t know what it really is and how they do it but the first few impressions on the nose is pure Campeltown. A light peat in perfect unison with reeds or hay dried on sunny hot beach sand. Also a good bunch of malt and grapefruit. Then really dominant bitter apple seeds. That’s new and really interesting. It is pure, it is straight forward it is really strong and convincing on its depth of aromas. So good. 

On the palate you get a fruity sourness with strong barley notes. Then on the back of your throat you get that bitter, sour and sweet sensation of a nice grapefruit along with some nice oak cask flavor. 

After the first taste the nose gets even better, which isn’t an easy thing to do because it already is so good. The taste remains as strong and amazing as from the start. 

Water adds some dried fruit aromas and adds a little sweetness - or at least it feels like that. 

I mean this whisky is definitely not on the sweet spectrum but instead quite sharp and with lots of different bitter notes - but this is delivered in such a good and complex unison and makes for a welcoming uniqueness. And it is definitely a strong competitor for its “mother” Springbank. I am really looking forward to the 16y or even the 18y in the future. 

You have to try this. Fantastic value for the still very low price."
