4.0,Sweet note with hints of oak. Very smooth without much heat but enough spice on the back end to be interesting
4.25,"Very Smooth, almost a sweet after taste of vanilla."
4.0,"So, I picked up a fresh batch of Smooth Ambler’s core range bottles while visiting my dad in West Virginia a couple of weeks ago.  I’ve had multiple bottles of Contradiction before and I really enjoy it as a mixer.  This latest batch (#126) is from the new recipe where they’ve decided to reduce the ABV from 50 to 46%.  Stretching the product, I suppose.  The cute Smooth Ambler bartender tried to tell me they spoke with fans and industry experts that asked for the reduction in ABV to make smoother cocktails.  I rolled my eyes, too...

Anyway, I still love this stuff.  It’s a beautiful, shiny copper in the taster and you’ll get some watery legs and big droplets if you like spinning your whiskey like I do.  The nose is vanilla and fresh cut oak with light rye and dill spice hiding in the background.  The palate follows suit, but is definitely more wood heavy.  The vanilla breaks up any harshness you might find and there are sticky and peppery rye notes holding everything together.  The mouthfeel is pretty rich and slightly oily, but I definitely notice a reduction in heat from the aforementioned 50% ABV version.  The finish is still long and spicy, which is what makes this blend so good IMHO.  The lingering heat and wood notes close out a very good neat drinking experience, while providing some great bite when mixing my bourbon and coke cocktails.

Overall, I can’t say I’m thrilled over the reduction in ABV (esp without a reduction in bottle price), but you really wont notice it in your favorite cocktail and if the cute bartender is correct- not many people drink this one neat, so there’s not a reason to worry about losing customers over cutting the ABV.  It’s still a solid 3.5-3.75 star dram for me, mixer or straight out of the bottle WV-style!  Pick up a bottle if you see it locally for less than $45.  Cheers."

3.0,Aroma has vanilla and oak along with green whiskey. More vanilla and oak on the palate; green whiskey comes through.

4.25,One of my favorites. The combination of a new and old heavy corn bourbon makes for a sweet but satisfying glass. Very rich caramel and vanilla flavor. I always have a bottle in my liquor cabinet.

3.75,"Beautiful color. Light floral and tropical fruit on the nose. Light floral, oak and vanilla in the mouth. Medium viscous mouth feel and quick clean finish with a lingering oak and spice. Good, not bad sipping, but not as memorable as I'd hoped at this proof (would be interesting to try this at 100-110)."

4.25,Initially a hint of green apple on the nose opening into caramel and oak with the slightest bit of smoked bacon. Tastes of sweet apple  and cereal. Mild spice and bread. Subtle with a a medium finish.

Plenty of body to the taste with a superb smooth start to finish."
3.75,A sleeper bottle that really hits the mark for me. Very distinctive flavor and priced well.

1.75,Tastes too much like scotch
4.0,Smooth sipper
2.0,The contradiction here is why this Smooth Ambler product is so lacking with an avg rating of 3.9.  This is just not very good unfortunately.  I usually like SA offerings.  I am not sure what happened with batch No.131.  I cannot recommend for $37 a bottle. The GSO Buyers Club stock pick by @ridethalightin

3.75,"One of the first bottles I purchased off a recommendation from the clerk at the store. 

Open for about 5 months and a little over 1/3 through

N(3.75): delightful nose. Gentle though. Sweet honey drizzled over berries initially. After a couple of sips, it transforms into sugared oak with red berries in the back seat. 
P(3.5): honey covered berries in the front and vanilla and oak in the mid to back pallet with two dashes of spice. Flavors become less pronounced sip after sip. Easy to drink. Just not something interesting enough to study
F(3.5): light linger of oak and vanilla. No hug and a tiny bit of spice. Doesn’t wow you but enjoyable. 

I recommend this as a party drink. You don’t have to pay attention to it but it’s enjoyable."

2.75,"Less drinkable, and fewer of the deep tasting notes, than I prefer. Those who appreciate a spicy bourbon without too much sweetness will be drawn to this one. That said, if it’s all I have, I can find appreciation for what it is - rather than what it is not."
