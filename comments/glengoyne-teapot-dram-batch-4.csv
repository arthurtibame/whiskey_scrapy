5.0,"A wave of intense flavor. Sweet, marinated, caramelized stone fruits followed by a rush of vanilla spices and melted caramel. The spice brings a burn with it like the wood barrels are continuing to toast right in your mouth. The finish is long, sweet, and will match the kick of any of the best bourbons you will ever try. This is the best scotch I have ever had (2/26/2020)."
