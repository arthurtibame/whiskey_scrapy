4.0,My barrel was rich & full of flavor.  So very much better than any bottle of 90 proof Old Forester I've ever had.
3.0,"The whiskey is soft on the nose for 90 proof. Smells of extremely sweet vanilla, and on the first chew it reinforces it. The whiskey is in fact so strong on vanilla that it makes it hard to get past it. Good, but not great; I really wish there was more depth of flavor being a single barrel. On second conversation with Bynjamin, I agree with the hot pepper spices lingering on a back note."
3.0,"[11.28.15] Go Bucks, beat Michigan! Bought this down at liquor barn so it was a special series 3 edition. Broke it open for a Buckeye win (10 min and counting) over that scUM. 
  
  Nose is very sweet with caramel. A swirl reveals a hint of that ether alcohol I try to avoid - but hidden beneath so many layers. 
  
  Taste is also sweet and salty/spicy caramels. Vanilla syrup hits you in the face, followed by stiff pepper spices that will burn at your taste buds a bunch. This needs more oak time to taste a bit less like vanilla extract and vodka. Three stars, not enough complexity to merit greater. Would be a great dessert bourbon with a birthday cake."

Taste - Oaky vanilla simple, light strawberry & orange zest, light cinnamon spice, thin and lightly drying mouthfeel.
Finish - Lingering cinnamon/white pepper tingle, lightly bitter over-oaked barrel-aged vanilla simple, hint of sugar-free strawberry candy sweet.
Score - 74/100
Final Thoughts - The nose gives the impression that this will be a nice dark caramel bourbon, but once it hits the tongue, it falls a bit flat but adds this fruity strawberry dimension that's quite nice. No details were given on this particular single barrel, but it tastes like it was a bit over-oaked and then they tried to combat it just by watering it down a bit, which did help, but not enough. I think this would be best sipped over a single ice cube to possibly help tame down the oak a bit or made into an old fashioned where the simple might help negate the splenda-like finish and you could probably reduce the bitters a bit as the oak already does a good job."

Medium caramel color. Somewhat thin, but leaves narrow legs on the glass that linger after a swirl.

The nose is clean and minty.  Some raw sugar cane and sweet white cake or frosted sugar cookies.

Creamy cherry-vanilla cola on the palate.  It tastes like a 50-50 blend between the gentle caramel sweetness of Buffalo Trace and spiced cherry flavor of Old Forester Signature (but without the young burn).  A gentle peppered spice lingers quite a while on the finish, with residual sweetness on the tongue.

Truly this is head and shoulders above Old Forester Signature, which is still quite the respectable value.  Not sure how this particular store pick varies from the generic single barrel selections, but it’s a surefire winner for $30.  I have typically seen the single barrel for upwards of $40 in the past."

Palate: The nose seems a little bit deceptive as it makes you think this will be a sweeter bourbon. Velvety mouth feel.

3.75,This is my 100th review. Single Barrel is a more mellow Old Forester 1910/20. Quite balanced. It reminds me a lot more of Woodford Reserve (and their double oaked) more than the standard Old Forester 86. If you want something less in your face than the 1910 and lower proof than the 1920 you’d enjoy this.

3.25,"Taste:  Neat in Glen Cairn, 2oz.  Binny's Barrel Pick

Nose (3.25):  Green banana and ethanol dominate at first.  Gives way to some vanilla and newer oak.  To me the nose seemed that of a newer bourbon.

Palate (3.00): A bit woody and somewhat acetone at first sip.  Not my favorite first sip.  Spicy pepper notes at the rear palate and some oak.  I am not thrilled by this one.  It is just ok, but not writing home about it.  Might be good in a mixed drink

Finish (3.5):  Finishes better than the taste.  That green banana on the nose makes a return trip, some butterscotch notes linger.  Considerably dry.

Overall: First, I am a bit of an Old Forester fan.  I loved all four of the whiskey row, especially 1910 and 1920.  This one didn't do it for me.  Second, I prefer Statesman, 1920, 1910, 1897, and even the signature over it.  Barrel not my profile?  Maybe.  Found it a bit ""nail polish"" remover like."

I'm very happy with this store pick. This bottle was sweet and spicy. I don't get the cherry notes typically mentioned in OF reviews, but I do get baked sweetness with a cinnamon spiciness. The nose is barrel-forward, and the barrel remains assertive throughout tasting without dominating the experience. This bourbon is, for lack of a better description, very ""bright"". I would describe it as fruity, but I can't pick out specific fruit flavors. This easily could be an everyday drinker. It's certainly a summer drinker."

3.5,"I am reviewing a BevMo Single Barrel Pick. The barrel was from the 7th Floor of Warehouse J.

Old Forester have really impressed me with their recent releases! The Rye was a great release for the money and their entire Whiskey Row collection is quite excellent (especially the 1920). Up until recently I never really thought about purchasing a single barrel mainly because there is little price difference between it and the 1920 in my market. Both sell for around $45 and some stores charge north of $50 for the single barrel! However, I have now had many samples from various stores and was pretty impressed with them. So finding one for under $40 at my local BevMo I decided to buy it! Now a word of caution, there really is quite a bit of variance in these store picks. Some can be really hot for 90 proof. Some spicy and others like this just rich and nice mix of sweet and spice notes. So be warned my experience may vary quite a bit from yours! On to the tasting:

On the palette it's rich and buttery with big toffee, vanilla and brown sugar notes with a dash of buttered cornbread. The mid palette adds oak and an array of barrel spices with a touch of tobacco. The finish is fairly lengthy with oak, and now rye and pepper with that buttered corn bread note. A bit of heat on the finish as well. 

All in all it's a really well constructed no nonesense Bourbon that for 90 proof is about as robust as you will get. For a Bourbon drinker that wants no frills and a damn fine pour that plays it straight down the middle this certainly will hit your sweet spot. For me I'll knock 1.5 points off for that exact reason. It's good but not great. It's probably a bottle I'll keep in stock for when I am in mood for classic Bourbon but won't pull on it too often. 

Happy Saturday all and Cheers!"

Strawberry blonde color and a little thin in the glass.

Nosing reveals prominent vanilla frosting with a hint of cherry, morphing into the bananas, rum, and brown sugar of bananas foster.  A touch of fresh cane, mint and vegetation.  The nose is enlivening and a definite winner.

Creamy mouthfeel.  The viscosity draws saliva.  Again, vanilla dominates while oak and gentle astringency show around the periphery of the mouth.  Definitely sweet, showing some brown sugar and butterscotch.  The finish lingers impressively for 90 proof with both sweetness and a drying sensation.

The SiB is a bit overpriced typically in the $45 range (store pick or otherwise) but this was a steal at $30.  I will continue to enjoy this bottle.  A great and affordable representation of OF considering their whisky row series is a tad overpriced, although I’ll cave every time for some 1920."

3.75,"Taste:  1.5 oz neat in Glen Cairn.  This is Binny#4294, Floor 4, Warehouse L

Nose: (3.75)  Sweet Tea and oak with some peppery notes.  Definate improvement from the last pick I had.  Not complex but very pleasing. The nail polish remover that I hated the last time isn't there this time.

Palate: (3.75) Very spicy for an Old Forester at first sip.  I get a bit of banana, with more peppery flavors.  Buttery mouthfeel and more well rounded.  Honestly amazes me that this is the same mashbill and proofed at 90.  It is a bit hot but tending to be a rye forward enthusiast I like it.

Finish:(3.75)   lingers on the palate in a good way.  Oaky and drying.  This might be a complaint for some but I appreciate some of the rugged woody notes.  Fades to a hint of brown sugar.

Overall:  A perfect study on why different single barrels are not the same.  The first one I sampled 3 mos ago left me with question marks.  This one left me with a new appreciation.  It is not in a league with any of the 4 whiskey rows, but then again it is about $20 less.  All in all it is better than the shelf 90 proof, but not the best store pick I have had this year.  It is solid but in my opinion an ""inbetweener"""

3.75,"After visiting the distillery in Louisville, I was inspired to try and find a Single Barrel, which I did. I’m very familiar with their whiskey row series and now their 100 proof, let’s see how this one stacks up. This one was picked by Bill Sinks at Bluegrass Beverages in Hendersonville, TN.

The nose has vanilla, brown sugar, cherries and baking spices and a little oak.
The palate has those baking spices leads into a slight yeast/bread note, some light fruit notes as well as some oak. 
The finish is on the medium side, but very pleasant. It being 93 proof makes this one fairly easy to drink.
All in all, I like this one. Compared to their regular 100 proof version (just did these back to back), the single barrel is a little muted, which makes it easy to drink. Nothing off putting at all, just not overly interesting. I think I like the 100 proof 1929 and 1910 better than this one."

4.0,The nose is cherry/vanilla cake. So good. For 90 proof it is not as smooth as I would have thought. Tons of flavor though. So different than the Buffalo Trace lineup I am used to drinking. More of a sipper over ice with a good burger than something to start the night with - or end the night with.

4.0,"I’m coming back to this bottle after almost 2 weeks and it’s opened up quite well. It reminds me of an oaky-er Elijah Craig Sm Batch or a slightly less sweet and more bitter Buffalo Trace. Palate is not quite as creamy but.... Plenty of vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, and hints of oak however nothing like the oak in OF 1920 or 10. Except bitter in a good way if you can imagine. Generally barrel bitterness does  no good for me but this is an exception."

3.5,"Store pick from Liquor Express in Tempe Arizona. Interestingly, they had two picks available; a “sweet” pick and a “spicy” pick. I went with the “sweet”. On to the review..,

Nose is primarily a vanilla bomb, with some caramel, orange, and a nice toasted oak note underneath. 

On the palate there’s caramel, vanilla, orange, and cinnamon and not much else. Very “traditional”. Doesn’t really change in the short finish, just more of the same with a hint of oak but you have to really concentrate on it to pick it out. Very mild on the spice level. Mouthfeel is thin.

This is decent if you like traditional bourbon flavors (I do) and has zero off-flavors, but lacks any sort of pizazz or character. Just not enough going on. I purchased this on a Black Friday sale for $34, but the normal price is $45 and if I had paid that I would have been sorely disappointed. No way it’s a rebuy at that price with everything else out there."
3.75,"This is a single barrel store pick from Chuck’s Liquors (Bowling Green, KY USA)
Bottled: 2019
Warehouse: L
Floor: 4

Nose: Woodford mash bill shows up but with a little more volume—sweet fruits, vanilla, caramel

Palate: quite rich for a mainline Old Forester, the single barrel variant shines here, the barrel and oak come through on the palate quite well. The oak is subtle but it’s there. 

Finish: medium, with some rye spice 

This is a great example of what the main OF line can be. The Whiskey Row series is excellent for sure but this single barrel is great as well if you have had the regular 86 or 90 proof or even the bonded version."
2.75,A little hot for my taste
3.75,"Rich flavor but somehow not well balanced, smokey, nutty, touch of cinnamon. Lack of fruity"
4.0,"Cap ‘n Cork Barrel Pick

Nose: Astringent, strong alcohol on the nose with some cinnamon. I also get a whisper of berry

Edit: with more tastings, I get a pronounced chocolate covered cherry flavor. On my second bottle.

Palette: very sweet with vanilla, berry, along with oak, and tobacco. Medium burn that does not mask the complexity.

Finish: lingers with little burn. Lasting flavor of vanilla and some cinnamon.

Overall, I like this barrel pick. It is an approachable sipper with nice flavor. It may benefit from a higher proof, but 90 doesn’t disappoint."

2.5,"Licorice on the nose with classic maraschino cherry and soft vanilla. Not overly rich on the palate and focuses more on the molasses sweetness and red fruit. Feels light and clean instead of oily and viscous. 
Perfectly in the middle of the spectrum. Anybody would be happy to have a dram of this."

3.5,I have a couple bottles and while they focus on an overly sweet profile most of the time they have very little flaws. This bottle is from Mickey Finns in Florence South Carolina. It was $35 which I found to be a great value. Very sweet start from this one and then it turns into liquid form of twizzlers. Intense cherry twizzler flavor followed by some vanilla cream and then a nice sweet oak. It’s a simple straightforward dram that although is not complex it has good flavor and not flawed in any way. I’m looking forward to the new 100 proof single barrel in May from Old Fo!

4.0,"Pipe tobacco and slight leather and chocolate, with maybe a little - not unpleasant - mustiness on the nose. Rich mouthfeel, with a complexity I haven’t figured out yet on the first night’s tasting. Moderate heat with a lingering finish. Good complement to spicy food."

3.75,As a single barrel there will be some fine nuances but I definite got fruity notes like banana in the nose and an overwhelming Caramel presence throughout the flavor. The finish isn’t long but it’s only a 90proof dram.

4.25,"Nose: Bananas and vanilla.  Honey.  Toasted grains.  Floral soap.  Oak.  Stone fruits.  Oranges and cream.  Strawberries, raspberries.  White chocolate.

Palate: Bananas, vanilla, oak, brown sugar.  Peaches, strawberries, blueberries.  Whipped cream.  Pepper.  Thyme, basil - bit more of the rye spice poking through.  Dill.  Some barrel bitter and tannin.  Mouthfeel is medium-light.  Finish showcases brown sugar, vanilla, oak, and char.  Flowers and flour.  The ethanol helps carry things and bring some brighter characteristics, swells up, and then starts to fade away providing a subtle effervescence.  The bottom and mid palate almost completely disappear and the flavor tends towards slightly bitter blueberries, peaches, and cream.  That oak hangs on through that whole thread, with the barrel bitter hanging out pretty much the whole time.

Other notes: Classic bourbon, leaning into sweet fruits.  This is a BevMo pick - 4th floor in warehouse L.  Decently balanced overall, the ethanol pokes its head out a little more than I'd like, though that does bring some life to an otherwise very mid-palate heavy party.  There's not much low-end to build on here.  Definitely an easy sipper that executes against the standard bourbon profile very well."
