2.0,"Speyside Scotch notes and flavor - albeit, on a very watered-down level.  Light on the pocketbook, but want some Scotch... well, this may be your ticket.  Won’t blow your mind, but it also won’t blow you wad."

3.0,"Good tasting, smooth inexpensive Scotch. A good everyday drinker."
2.0,No age stated on the bottle.  Single malt that has a decent taste.  Price wise $20 or less for a single malt that tastes like a single malt from a Speyside distillery.

2.5,Smell sweet peanuts and toffee. Taste like I added water even though I haven't. Buttery like an irish but with very little smoke on the end.

3.75,I am a fan of Glenn Moray and this was the closest I found at Trader Joe’s.   The nut and Carmel come out to play over ice!  It’s a easy Happy hour sipping scotch or night cap pleasure. Not extravagant but simple joy!
2.5,a slight peat with earthy tones. a bit of water brought out the earth and a bit of ash.
3.0,"A bit sweet and light, but still produces a nice peat note in the back."
2.5,Nose is peanut brittle with mild peat and smoke.  Taste has some honey notes and similar peat/smoke from the nose.  Almost seems slightly watered down even though I added no water.
