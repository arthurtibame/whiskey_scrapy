5.0,"First impressions of the nose bring to mind the finesse of Laphroaig and the smoky vibrancy of Port Charlotte — I'm intrigued from the first moment; nose continues with smoked meat, malt, and morning dew; taste is of more sweet and smoky meat (prosciutto?), and next comes honeydew and medicinal, herbal tea; the complexity the peat offers this dram is pretty extravagant; the finish is long and smooth, like a nice English tobacco blend; Mull has impressed me with this one — Islay aficionados, do try. Great to have this in Glasgow's lovely Kelvingrove Café. Five stars for overall taste and value."

5.0,"On the nose, light peated, citric with notes of lemon, little bit sweet with a medicinal accent, weak floral background and a fresh sea feeling. Brings me memories of sunny morning in the beach. A medium complexity that is just right. The taste goes spicy with some saltiness, and again medicinal. The finish is long and complex, starts with a bold fresh citric flavour, goes bitter, than some mint appears, fades out bringing some cloves and finishes going in the direction of salty stuff again. Amazing whisky, for sure my favourite 10 years old."

I really miss the slight sweetness and fruitiness that make Laphroaig and the like so complex and enjoyable. Perhaps some water would reveal these subtleties, but neat, I'm not ordering this again until I need snow boots to get to the bar."

4.0,"This is difficult; just when I think I've got a scent or a flavor pinned down, it's gone, either into thin air or merged with something else to create a new entity.  Most interesting!  The nose is very earthy; think damp cave with moss and lichens and a cooking fire in the corner roasting a spit of salted meats while the ocean breeze drifts in.  And I'm still missing things.  The palate opens thick and chewy, with a bit of rubber tire, smoked meats, vegetals (again) and then peat followed by a short hit of lemon before it transmogrifies (thanks Calvin and Hobbes!) into a campfire. The finish is the best part of this, lasting several very smoky minutes.  If you want an ever-changing, never dull, affordable, and absolutely NOT-sweet-in-any-way Scotch, give this a try.  I promise the second sip will be different from the first. And quite probably better. I now must find a bottle of Tobermory..."

4.0,"If you are a peat head and want to widen your horizon beyond Islay, this Single Malt is waiting to be discovered! At first glance, Ledaig 10 (peated Tobermory) is very reminiscent of Islay malts - but it's less sweet and distinctly different. A complex bouquet of smoked ham, sea salt, citrus fruits and both floral and savory notes hides behind intense, mineral peatiness. The arrival is strong, fresh and quite dry, followed by burned licorice, aniseed and loads of white pepper. Distant maritime notes and hints of mint crown the substantial finish. A first-class malt!

4.0,"I'm a huge fan of the Islands, with Talisker as my top mistress.   It was just recently that I even heard of Ledaig (or late-chick, as Scott's local wine merchant calls it).  I'm quite impressed by it---it's a cross between the brute Talisker and aromatic Islays.  I'm getting lemons and brine on the nose.  Slight peat, but really not to the level of your stronger Islays.  Taste is salty pretzels, orchard fruits, with a hint of smoked sardines.  This is a great entry way for folks not able to take an Islay, but looking into something beyond Soeyside and Highlands.    I really have to thank Scott for ithis sample, and more so for introducing me to Islanders beyond my narrow scope of Talisker.   Thanks Scott!!"

4.0,"Another Sunday evening on particularly  cold December evening before Christmas.  House is surprisingly quiet; just the wife and me (and youngest playing XBox).  Getting in the Christmas mood, with the calmness, SiriusXM Holiday Pops playing (I like this channel at Christmas time), uncorked the Ledaig 10.  (Talked with the liquor store owner where I purchased this: to recall the pronunciation, in keeping the story short, he calls it “Late-Chick”; thought that was mildly amusing and would pass it on).
    
The straw colored pour releases the aromas of honey glazed ham, ocean sea salt, malt, ripened white orchard fruit (freshly picked Gala apples).  It sweetens as it settles with an increasing touch of mineral/earthiness.  A lovely nose that can be inhaled all day long.  A sip reveals a slick texture that carries with it cigar smoke/ash, vanilla, honey, in that progression that all crescendos to a balanced potpourri of flavor.  The flavors slowly depart giving way to white pepper and oak.  A long lasting, warming and drying white pepper spiciness lingers with oak and charcoal with a hint of fennel and ocean salt.  
    
A lovely character from nose to finish conjures images of oceanside bonfires.  A freshness that is subtle and suites well with the aromas and flavors.  Flat out enjoyable. Especially if you are an Islay seeker. Not often talked about in peat-seeker circles, but belongs in that conversation. All this at a highly respectable price.

4.0,"When I had this, I suddenly thought, ""What is up with this weird ABV that somehow Bunnahabhain and Ledaig both decided would be their bottling strength?""  Google quickly informed me that the two have shared ownership, which now makes sense.  Ledaig is a peated scotch from the Isle of Mull, a bit south of Islay, and in everything but geographical origin basically is an Islay scotch.  It has a nice, peaty entry, with a warm, buttered toast, crispy-crust smoke, but also a healthy dose of new-log-on-the-campfire aroma.  Other than that, I get a citrus lemon or lime combination very similar to Kilchoman Machir Bay and Ardbeg 10, with just a hint of minerality.  The palate is sweeter than those two, but the flavors don't pop quite as much.  Its light, pleasant sweetness kind of makes me imagine what a peated Glenmorangie would be like.  The finish is mellow peat, woodiness and grassiness, salt and brine, and then a bit of tang or acidity at the very end.  This scotch reads to me like a more mature version of Machir Bay, but I'm missing some of that youthful energy.  They are quite close, though, and honestly I would mistake one for the other easily in a blind tasting."

4.0,"An old scotsman told me drinking a bottle a day or two after its open makes a big difference in taste. 20% better he said. Not sure how he got that figure but he was bang on the money with this whisky. First opened it was a bit harsh - 3 stars i thought. Day 2 its already up to a 4. I thought maybe a 5 as i love the bitter peaty intensity of this whisky with its well balanced sweetness. But then I tried my benchmark the Laphroaig 10 and it didn't quite measure up to its richness or depth of flavour. So 4 stars it is..for now. Update: Tried in a large tasting with a number of the islay greats including laga de, ardbeg 10 and I'd say its def no more than a 4. More a 3.5 after being opened a few months, some of the flavour subtleties fade and the bitterness intensifies"

It's light straw in color and produces very oily, long legs in the tasting glass.  On the nose, there's lots of peat smoke, pine needles and charred oak barrel.  The palate is a wash of spices, pepper and peat.  It has a medium to long finish with those same flavors dominating the entire profile.  It's a bit harsh and not at all complex, but enjoyable nonetheless.  I wouldn't mind keeping a bottle of this on hand for when I want a quick peat fix. Cheers"

4.0,"This is definatly a step up from Highland Park 12 if you are new to peated whiskys like I am. 
    
    The inital smell is acutally rather unpleasent, but that changes quickly. 
    
    Nose: For me it reminds me of a hookah. The smell when you light the coal, this is exactly what I get here. Below that is the destinct aroma of BBQ. Charred meat. You can almost feel the heat of the grill. And for some reason I get just a touch of citrus in there too. 
    
    Taste: It is surprisingly sweet. Not sugary sweet, more like...honey glazed ribs. Some smoked meat in there. My brain start pictureing grilled flank steak with pepper. It burns and is hot, but at the same time soothing. 
    
    And just before it goes down I get a hint of dark chocolate. 
    
    Aftertaste: For me the chocolate is the predominant aftertaste, but there is still a good amount of smoke in there. Doesn't last all that long, but the images of a nice BBQ with friends stay in your head for a while. 
    
    All in all a rather tasty whisky. If you are new like I am, don't let the initial smell discourage you. While this whisky has some bite, it's bark is worse. 
    
    Would not recommend this as the first whiksky you try, but if you like stuff along the lines of Highland Park 12, this will probably work just fine."

4.0,"Stop number 9 on the SDT is Ledaig from the Tobermory distillery on the Isle of Mull. Ledaig (pronounced le-chaig) is the peated version of the Tobermory line. This Island scotch comes in at 46.3% ABV, it is non chill filtered and natural color of golden straw. I reviewed the 18 year old a few months ago and gave it a good review and 4.25 stars. The 18 YO was sherry cask matured, this 10 YO is bourbon matured. 

Wow!  Initial nosing brought a big blast of tropical fruits. Mango, pineapple and maybe papaya. I was not expecting that. Quickly following was the peat influence. Mineral peat, seashore/seashells, damp and earthy. It turns sweet with honey, salted caramel and toffee. Back to fruits after a few minutes with nectarines, light oranges and lemon drop candies. It switches back to the peat with a tar/creosote and bonfire ashes. It flip flopped between the peat and fruit for a while before a nuttiness appeared with sweet vanilla, then finished off with light licorice and ginger. Incredibly complex for a 10 year old. Love it!

After the nose, the palate is a bit of a let down. Not in flavor, but in complexity. Bonfire ashes and peat smoke, light pepper. A bit salty with sweet vanilla. Wonderful taste, just a bit one dimensional. 

Light bodied mouthfeel that is mouthwatering. A nice long smoky finish to end the experience. 

I have to say I'm blown away by this 10 year old. It's not a peat bomb like a Laphroaig or an Ardbeg, but it is peatier than Bowmore, and it has more complexity than most of them and at a comparable price ($60 locally). I plan to grab a bottle if I see it on a shelf and I highly recommend it to all you peat heads out there. I am giving this the same score as it's big brother the 18 year old, but I think I like this one better based on what I remember of the 18. 4.25. Thanks to Scott for the sample. Cheers all"

3.0,"Nose - Campfire smoke, earthy peat, light green apple juice.
Taste - Apple/white grape juice concentrate sweetness, campfire ash, white pepper spice.
Finish - Long lingering white pepper spice, campfire ash turns slightly sour/iodine, more artificially sweetened apple juice.
Score - 69/100
Final Thoughts - Not being a huge fan of peated Scotches, this wasn't horrible. It has more of a dry peat versus the wet, rubber, band-aid, heavy iodine of other Islays. That being said, this seems quite one-dimensional as it has a singular tasting sweet mixed with campfire smoke/ash. The finish is a bit disappointing as it transitions slightly into the type of peat I'm not particularly fond of."

Also I don’t get the sour/bitter notes I get with some other peated whiskeys. The long pleasant, smoky finish really leaves a lasting impression. Not super complex, but very enjoyable. I will definitely buy this and keep it in my rotation."

    While distilled at the Tobermory Distillery on the Isle of Mull, the Ledaig 10 shows in every other aspect an Islay wisky, and proves that a full, rich, smokey whisky doesn’t necessarily has to originate from Islay. While a Laphroaig does remind of a nightly campfire at a windy beach however, this one more reminds me of Grandmothers’ coil stove while baking crispy sweet bacon. If she had had a coil stove that is. (She could cook a great bacon with eggs though!). 
    
    Damn, this is just a great dram. I really find it hard to rate. I’m inclined to rate it 5 stars, but I’ve already gave Lagavulin 16, Bruichladdich Black Art 4 and the Octomore 10 5 stars. For the moment I’m sticking with 4, but read 4 and a half stars, please."

4.0,"Nose: A robust smoky nose that is more about charcoal or campfire embers than billowing wood-smoke. Peaty notes follow the smoky introduction, and then a gust of iodine and ozone laced sea air. Bracing and crisp. As it rests and opens some faint bacon or ham aromas are identifiable and there is citrus oil carried on that ocean breeze.  Later, a gentle oiliness appears. When neat the nose is mineral and enlivening. I didn't get any fruity or floral aspect until I added water, which opens and softens the nose a good deal and allows some peaty waxiness to emerge.

Palate: A bold arrival, crisp dry aromatic smoke and quite a lot of tasty sea salt - almost like bacalhau that hasn't quite been soaked out. Hot root ginger and peppery lemon, which flourishes in the development and together with the background salt creates an almost astringent spiciness around the tongue.  Adding water transforms the palate by muting the salt and drawing out considerable sweetness and more peat. Little waves of smoke keep returning as it develops.

Finish: Long, warm, with salt, pepper and lemon zest spiciness eventually turning to sweetness. Smoke is the last actor left on the stage - almost like the flavour of a mild cigar smoked an hour previously.  (This whisky makes me remember smoking Montecristos and drinking tequila at Xpu Ha beach on a clear moonlit Christmas Eve, 20 years ago.  Thank you Ledaig).

A generally unknown and under-rated whisky, there are a lot of similarities between it and several of the younger Islay single malts. Its spiritual, if not geographic, home is somewhere midway between Ardbeg, Kilchoman and Caol Ila.

I've come to like this whisky a lot, but I'd be very curious to taste it at proper cask strength.  Recommended for smoky whisky fans, particularly if you like them unsherried.  Delicious neat, but it can take a little water if you like a softer experience.

4.0,"Very impressed with the intensity of the 10 year old malt under the peat smoke.   It has that fruity character that you only get from fresh ex bourbon casks.   Really enjoying this!   This is not tough to get through like a Laphroag 10 (as much as I do love it when I want full peat intensity), it's more akin to an Ardbeg with the sweetness and depth on the nose and palate, but with a less intense peatiness.   I get a distinct pineapple note on the palate.  Perhaps it's the batch but i'm not getting anything overly medicinal.  I get more of a campfire smoke personally.   I could understand the bacon/ham flavour others seem to be getting,  but prefer not to think of the smoke as being on meat, rather just on it's own.  Very happy with this purchase, if you like peated Scotch whisky you will not be let down."
null,"On a 33 degree Celsius day an ice block was required and it isn’t too bad. A few levels of aroma/flavours are probably locked in due to ice but it is difficult to drink without turning on AC on a warm day. Overall not a bad drink on the rocks. 

Aroma
Smoky notes should not be surprising. Sweet honey notes are present. 

Taste
Eases in with some sweet toffee or honey notes. Slight bitter notes appeared at the end. 

Finish
A light tingle of spice pepper notes."

#19: Ledaig.  Single Malt Scotch.  46.3% ABV.  10 year old.
Paid $60
Yes.  I will probably keep going back to this bottle on an intermittent basis.

I don’t know about terroir, but this whisky tastes like terrain.  It is melted down building material.  Soil, clay, Playdough, and rubber on the palate and on the nose.  Some fruitiness underneath all that mulchy earthy peat.  A pleasant lingering ginger and saltiness on the finish.  This is a lovable oddball compared to the peat staples of Ardbeg, Laphroaig, and Lagavulin; satisfying in its own way.  PUN ALERT: water unearths this dram and exposes more vanilla bourbon sweetness.  I prefer without any water.  Please: pronounce this “late chick.”

Nose: Archeological dig.  Swimming pool.  Earth.  Wind.  And fire.  Barbeque?
Palate: Soily greasy peat dominates.  Background of a young ex-bourbon profile.  Sharp grassy vanilla.  Slight sherry influence as well with raisins.
Finish: Dirt, oil, and “An Inconvenient Truth.”  Say what you say about climate change, but Ledaig is real.
Pros: Ledaig is legit its own thang.  The Original Taste of Farm.
Cons: Bruichladdich made this obsolete with Octomore.

Ledaig can be a beast, young or old, in independent bottlings.  I highly recommend going for a gamble, it you can find some indie bottling at a higher ABV but for a similar price, regardless of age.
If you liked this and want something OB, and to spend 3-4x more for something way cooler: Octomore 6.1 or 7.1

4.0,It took about a quarter of the way through this bottle to figure this one out. From very apprehensive to full out enjoyment for this expression. Sweet sour and funny enough Smokey bacon and I’ll admit I got this after reading the description but it’s there. I know it’s not the power of suggestion because I read it before the first dram and I thought they are crazy for writing that. This scotch needs time to reveal itself. So much fun. Good job Ledaig I will replace this one.

- The color is light gold
- On the nose you can recognize the pleasant smoke alongside some oak notes
- On the palate there is a strong aroma of peat, dried fruits, walnuts and some black pepper notes
- The finish is subtle, reminds of the oak casks in which it was maturated

After tasting this, I am curious about the other line of whisky from Tobermory, maybe I'll follow up with Tobermory 12. I am sure it would be as interesting as this one."

Finish: long with a way at the end rye bread. Nice and warming, chocolate and smoke. Also cigar flavors late. Charred wood (oak?), smoked fish 

Note: this is a good peat malt, I’m not a big big peat guy but this is delicious. A really nice balance of big peat with sweet and smoke, I really like this one."

4.75,"I firmly believe that the best Island distilleries can go to toe-to-toe with Islay's finest. Talisker, Highland Park, and now this Ledaig from Tobermory.

Nose: Salt and brine jump out of the glass. Beyond that it's medicinal peat smoke and iodine. A bit of sulfur.  Seaweed and a big lemon citrus note. Fresh-cut grass. Honey sweetness. And that delicious bacon note featured in the tasting notes here on distiller. Cinnamon spice at the tail end. This one is pungent enough to fill the room with a mere uncorking of the bottle. And I'm glad it does because this nose is nothing short of superb.

Palate: Oily, smoky, salty, briny. Salt, salt, salt. It's like taking a bite out of a soft pretzel. More zesty lemon. Honey, vanilla, butterscotch sweetness. Caramel and and fudge. Some darker fruits like plum. Maybe a bit of tobacco. Strong black pepper and maybe a bit of vinegar.
Edit: After reading a review by @Richard-ModernDrinking I have to add hookah smoke to my notes. Now that I've read it, there's absolutely no mistaking it.

Finish: Moderate-to-long. Some cinnamon and black pepper, the rest is all sea salt. It'll leave you feeling like you just spent a day in the ocean.

If you don't like salt, don't even bother with this one. Fortunately I do, and this one is an absolute winner for me. It's certainly worthy of being in the discussion of best flagship Islay/Island expressions. Is it No. 1? Maybe not, but it's not too far off.

At $60 I'd buy again. It may be a tad high but I'm not complaining. A background dram by no means, this one is enough to command the attention of an experienced peat-head. This one checks all the boxes for me. After this, I'm looking forward to trying another malt from the Isle of Mull."

Nose: In a word, savory. Mouthwatering notes of peat, cooking bacon, salty brine, honey, and light lemongrass rise up to tempt one's senses. With a splash of water, mossy / dried grass and plum notes become more prevalent.

Taste: On the palate notes of vegetal peat, sweet red apple, BBQ char also match the savory vibe and nose. With a splash of water, a sweeter strawberry candy note becomes more visible.

Finish: The finish is long and leaves a light salty and tangy note.

Thoughts: This scotch I 100% recommend and would buy it personally again. I love that they kept it at an honest proof of 46.3% ABV, rather than stretching it to make it go farther, yet weaker. This may be my new favorite scotch actually! I haven’t had one this savory and tasty, but this has caused me to long to find more! Thank you very much Tobermory! Sláinte!"

4.0,"Sweet shisha, this is a good whisky. That’s a description as much as an exclamation, as the Ledaig’s aroma of sweet hookah tobacco triggered a Proustian flashback to a trip to Cairo more than 30 years ago. The sweetness of the nose carries onto the palate on first sip, but the influence of the bourbon casks isn’t one-dimensional. The flavors turn dry and then tangy before combining into a long finish. It’s a rich and satisfying mix of sweet and savory at a good strength and a great price. It’s as enjoyable as many an Islay and very worthy of the praise I increasingly hear for the distillery. This was my first Ledaig and I’m curious to see how the more exotic variants in my sample library stand up to this benchmark. In the meantime, I highly recommend this taste of an Arabian night. 

CORRECTION: I just noticed I had a Ledaig 13 Amontillado five months ago, so this is my second from the distillery. I rated the 13 three stars,"
2.0,"Ledaig you salty dog! 

I don't mean it in a good way. I had a hard time with this dram.

The best of it is on the nose. A medium-light peat smoke and ocean spray are dominant and are supported by faint red wine notes and Orange Pekoe tea. There was also something that brought an image to mind of a shed of old farm machinery on my grandparents' farm. I couldn't put my finger on it until the third or fourth tasting - a not unpleasant creosote smell. 

The palate holds some pear, grape skin, black pepper, lemon with cloves, paracetemol tablets and enough salt to pay a Roman legion. The finish was not one to beckon me back: a dry tannic aftertaste like putting a cold wet teabag on your tongue. And lingering salt like a french kiss from Lot's wife. 

For me this was a real disappointment as I had high hopes and it is well rated. But to my tastes it's as salty as a swearing pirate and not one I would relish returning to."

3.5,"It’s a cold and rainy day in Texas. Time for PEAT!

Found this at the back of the shelf when cleaning out the cabinet this morning. I just tried the Tobermory 10, which is Ledaig’s unpeated brother. All those flavors are still there, creamy vanilla malt, sour citrus, and salt. Add to that now a sweet, meaty smoke (reminds me of ribs...) and a hit of brine to enhance the salty note. 

On the palate it’s chewy and oily, and it almost heats up in your mouth as you drink it, almost like alcoholic pop rocks. Just like with its brother, this dram has a lovely long, mouth tingling finish that lingers on the mid-palate with elements of sea spray, bacon, smoke, and a drying sensation. It’s like Ardbeg 10 without the punch to the stomach. 

So how does this pour stand up with other peated Islay/Island drams? It’s good. It has an age statement. It sells for about $50 in Texas, which is $10 less than Talisker 10 or Lagavulin 8, but $10 more than Ardbeg or Laphroaig 10. Its gentler than an Islay, bit lacks the punch I love in Talisker. It’s well made stuff, but doesn’t stand out in a crowded peaty field. For me, it’s a pass on a bottle but it was lovely to visit while I did. Plenty to enjoy here, and I’d happily imbibe if offered a pour. I think it’s unpeated brother the Tobermory 10 stood out more in taste vs. VFM. Cheers!"

3.75,"The Bottle: Similar to my review of its sister, Tobermory, this is a very classy bottle to have on your shelf. There's some nice relief in the glass that refers to the Isle of Mull and the distillery's founding in 1798 and the label is straight-forward and unpretentious. Like the Tobermory, it makes reference to being un-chill filtered, but it doesn't say anything about natural color. 


In the Glass:  Honey & bronze.  This one's hard to read from a natural color perspective.  I'm going to presume that there isn't any E150 caramel color in the mix, but it'd be nice if they would just say that.  I should also call out that it’s now a bit darker than the last time that I had it. The image on distiller is very lemon-yellow, which is what it used to look like. No longer. 


On the Nose:  Coastal peat and a hint of underlying coal smoke.  This is definitely a salty islander, and you could easily be forgiven for thinking that it's from Islay.  Just behind the chimneysweep, there's an interesting mix of marine notes and what I would think figs would smell like if you removed all trace of sweetness.  A little bit Laphroaig, a little bit Talisker.

What’s really interesting is that this doesn’t just ready like “peated” Tobermory. Blindfolded, I wouldn’t be able to tell you that this has anything to do with the unpeated offering from the same distillery. This is its own thing. 

 
Taste:  This is where the sweetness comes in, barley sugar and dried fruit.  Then the marine note comes back in with a smoky/saline/fisherman kind of thing (it sounds ridiculous, but you probably know what I mean).  The development is mostly sweetness and the finish turns bitter and slightly astringent.  There’s no mention of it, but maybe this has seen the inside of a sherry cask?  It would explain the color…
You will want to add a few drops of water to this one seeing as its $46% abv., it helps tame down the finish.
Where this differentiates itself from its Ileach brethren is in the finish. There's something more savory going on that you don't necessarily find in many of the Islay malts of the same caliber. It's interesting, unique and pleasing to the palate. 


I quite like this. I’m a sucker for interesting and peated malts, and this doesn’t fail to deliver. If you’re looking to branch out beyond Islay, give this a go. It’s a touch more expensive that some of the more well known and similarly aged malts, but I like to think that more of the money is making it back to the distillery so that they can afford to take some creative risks in the future (this could be complete codswallop, but hey…). 

Update: Tobermory has confirmed that it is natural color."

4.0,"Love peated scotch and saw the high ratings/rankings. Available in 50ml at specs to try before $50 bottle so a couple i grabbed yes I did. My dram is 92.6 proof. Poured neat, noses honey smoke like the innards of a bees nest lit up. Malt, nougat and dusty cardboard. Soft and sweet with a little bit of wood. Palate is sweet malt and honey with rich smooth smoke and oak, wow is that tasty!!. Finishes with drying barrel and some fading malt and smoky honey. The peat is gentle with this scotch but provides some nice smoke accents for the flavors. Not a heavyweight like some other smokies yet very enjoyable. Would like to see it closer to $40 but still worth buying for rotation, its that good........91/100..........Im a sucker for that smoky honey taste. Another delicious peated scotch!"

3.75,"Bacon with a honeyed-flavor profile.  Peat shows up initially on the palate, but as well as in the finish: as charcoal briquettes or burnt wood.  Water tames it to reveal typical bourbon-cask flavors.  Oxidation after a couple of weeks lends even sweeter, bourbon-cask characteristics.  After the bottle is half-way to two thirds empty, the juice gets very citrusy, more so than any other peated expression I've tasted.

I wholly agree with NAX515, the Ledaig 10 is a strong contender for a notable place in the peat realm.

4.25,"Your brain tells you Islay but it’s from the Isle of Mull. Sweet, dark fruit upfront on the palate gives way to layered peat smoke that is intense but rounded. Think peppered bacon sandwiched between blackberry jellied toast. This will be a go-to dram in my lineup and it holds its own against Ardbeg 10 and Laphroaig 10. As a matter of fact, it may just be better than both. Outstanding bottle."

3.0,"Smokey, meaty peat dominates from start to finish, with a bit of sour apples making a subtle appearance. Good mouthfeel and a decently smooth finish."
3.5,"Another sample, the last time I had this was St Games Gate pub in Banff so this one gets half a star for great memories.

This was better than I remembered. It’s a more rubbery smoke than Islay but well balanced and quite nice. I wouldn’t buy it because I would categorize it with Laphroaig 10 and Laphroaig 10 is about the best value to quality ratio you will find."

3.75,"Nose is full of smoke. I agree with many others, it’s akin to charcoal briquettes. The taste had a smoky, savory, salty hit. Then the sweetness of light fruits come halfway. You got more of the smoke and brine on the finish. Not bad"
3.0,"Nose: 
Coal Smoke, like the pull of clean hookah coconut shell briquettes. Muted Butterscotch and Cereal note.
Taste: 
Forward is Bacon and Brine. Still Mild compared to Islay. Earthy Pear-like Fruit.
Finish: 
Oily Leather. Sweat and Seaweed. Completes what It began."

4.0,"Peaty bacon spreads clearly even from a distance, by bringing the nose closer the aromas are enriched with burnt tires, dirt, a tonic medicinal note embraced by the ocean (disinfectant type diluted in sea water, excellent for fumigations). On the background, cloves, pear, cereals. It is a rough nose, in some ways not very balanced, where peat tends to prevail leaving little room for evolution, but for those who love the genre it is inviting in its own way.
In the mouth, alcohol stings perhaps more than it should, but in some way it accords with the abrupt character of the whisky. Obviously peat, with a clear herbaceous and earthy profile while maintaining its fleshy soul, like a bacon wrapped in tufts of grass and breaded with dirt, very ""dirty"" and agricultural. Strands of smoke are added (the breaded bacon has been roasted), scorched biscuits, vanilla cream, pear and cloves, medicinal notes ended up on the background. A mix of youth and farmer's soul, if he could speak the first word would certainly be a very colorful curse.
Quite long finish, of ash, grass, bacon and cereals."

2.5,"Today’s tasting was after Ardbeg’s (10, An Oa, Grooves) and a Laphroaig PX. Ledaig is not in the same league. The smoke is less pleasant and more aggressive.  This shows how much the impact of what your are drinking at the same time has on your rating.  This is a full one star drop from my last rating and this is a do not buy.  Laphroaig first, then Ardbeg."

3.5,"Very smoky, and peaty on the nose and in taste. Pretty smooth, not a lot of sweetness, or other flavors. Oily mouthfeel. A solid peated malt."
3.5,"I think i had high hopes on this one, but i did not have any real reason for those high hopes. This is a whisky that tries to look like an Islay/Island Whisky without achieving the great level of this two scotland regions. Actually it comes from an Island called Mull, and this is the peaty expression of Tobermory. 

Bottled at 46.3% abv. 

On the nose it is good. Its peat is exactly like ardbeg or kilchoman. Burnt cake crest, Grapes. Artificial flavor.

On the palate, everything goes south. Oak, Pepper; Oily, maybe too much. Tobbacco and a cheap butterscotch. Finish is kind of winey and hot. 

Overall it seems like this one lacks some balance and a better palate. Overall i give this dram a fair 72 over 100."
3.75,"Gentle yet professional smoked aroma, bit of sea salt at the finish with dry essence. Well done, worth the cost for one time exploration. Great gentlemen evening."
3.75,"The nose has a very sharp brine and a harsh vegetal note like radishes or turnips.  I get some cask wood as well, with a hint of caramel.

It tastes like it smells.  There is a sharp brine that tastes like a rough sea on a stormy day.  The peat is vegetal and the smoke is ashy.  It's like being in a seaside hut during a storm, warming yourself by a smoky fire.  The malt flavor comes through the harsher elements, and hints of caramel emerge as well as shortbread.  It has medicinal character character and has very strong phenol.  The phenol dominates the palate.

The flavors are not well balanced, but that's ok.  They really battle for their place in this storm in a glass.  The ""lack"" of balance actually makes it much more interesting.

The peat phenol and brine dominate the finish.  This is one of the most phenolic whiskeys I've had in recent memory - which seems odd for me to say because I love Islay whiskey, and this somehow seems more phenolic than many of those.  Something savory like smoked fish emerges late.

I am pleasantly surprised by this.  This is a maritime whiskey even by maritime standards!"
5.0,Everybody needs a bottle of this. A realy manly drink.
4.5,"Smokey maple on the nose, can also tell straight off that it’s peated. Reminds me a lot of a Lagavulin nose. Full bodied, but not particularly oily. Smoke comes through on the taste, gets some bitter notes near the end (in a pleasant way). Finish is burnt toast with cinnamon"
4.25,"This is truly unique, and I’ve found nothing else that tastes like it. It’s like a cross between an Islay and a campbeltown. It has a bit of that earthy funk, but with more of a saline edge with plenty of heat around it. 

It’s an excellent bottle and a must try for any that like unique smells and flavors."
