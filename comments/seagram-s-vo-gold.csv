5.0,"I noticed the appearance to be deep honey amber, with little fence board alcohol legs, all lined up. The aroma is of mellow nectar, spearmint, candied dry fruits, and a touch of wood. Taste is of soft wood flavor, a whisper of char, some mint, flowers, and sugar. This is very mellow and mild (as per the tasting notes, on the label). The finish is of a moderate and gradual fade, but it's not lingering and cloying. The 8-year aging seems to bring out the best of the whiskies, blended in this one. I think it's what a bourbon hater will love and what a bourbon lover will hate. It's a jewel, in my booklet. I'm sad that it's going away. RJT"

4.5,First things first... I'm a new whiskey drinker.  I find this to be very smooth not much bite and goes down warm with the warmth lingering for a bit. Perfect for cold Montana Winters. Delicious!
