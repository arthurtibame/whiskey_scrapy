5.0,"Who would’ve thought that mixing 28 single malts together would actually turn out really good?   I had originally thought of this as a big marketing gimmick...and maybe it is, but hell, it worked.  A bowl of fresh fruit and roasted nuts for the aroma; sherry cask had a huge part here.  Palette Is all over the place, but somehow ends really well.  Like a football team made up of rejects and a screwed up diverse cast, but somehow winning the Super Bowl.  Waxy mouthfeel, I guess Clyneish had a big part here.  Mine was only a sample, but I’ll look into getting a bottle"
