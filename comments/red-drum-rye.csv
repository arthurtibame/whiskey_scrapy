2.75,"From a small taster at the distillery. This is a 2-year old, 51 % rye, 4 grain mash that features wheat, malted barley & corn. 

This is light and sweet on the taste buds with an orchard fruit emphasis and a nice touch of spice and wood. 

I like it enough to want a better taste. I'm curious how this stacks up to Rittenhouse, Old Overholt or Wild Turkey..."
