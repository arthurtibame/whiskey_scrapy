I really enjoy this range as I feel the distillers craft the bottlings in a way that usually represents the distillery well unlike a lot of the IB's. There was almost white wine like nose flavours, reisling  perhaps. On the palate lovely viscous honey, and sweet butterscotch. I think the trick to these offerings as you really need to let them sit and open up a bit with time and or a few drops of water. It progressively got better and the bitterness faded into the background. Solid 4 I'll give it."

4.0,"It's a tragedy this whisky is so difficult to come by, because the liquid is delicious.
  
  There's honey and heather, with touches of almonds and wood spices. It's delicate yet complex, and it makes a great single malt.
  
  If you can get your hands on this, I recommend you do. And add the Dailuaine 16 to your cart while you're at it."
2.75,Enjoyed at the recommendation of Stewart Sterling. A lovely lighter style. Not something to seek out again.

Friendly but not a pushover. Sweet but not too gentle."
