4.25,"Nose is chocolate, vanilla, and nutmeg, plus some undiscernible, slightly sour note. Getting a strong chocolate note on the taste, making me very much a fan, followed by a very slight spice and cinnamon. A faint note of Luxardo cherry appears after a couple sips. Oak, leather and minimal drying tanins end quickly on a medium finish. The rye spice is definitely present on the finish. Paired my second pour with some dark chocolate and dropped in a single Luxardo cherry and it was phenomenal. I really appreciate their transparency regarding sourcing as well."

3.0,Chocolate and vanilla on the nose. Tastes of tobacco and chocolate. Pretty significant spiciness from the Rye. Fairly short finish.

3.25,"Notes of corn & ethenol on the nose, spice on the palate finishes long with more ethanol. The young bourbon in the mix needs more barrel time. I wouldn't buy again."

3.25,Actually has quite a bite.  Notes of vanilla and caramel
2.75,"Some corn and rye notes, tastes a little young, not nutty or peppery, faint cinnamon on the finish.  No real honey or maple, faint vanilla.  The 12 year part from Old Forester maybe"

4.0,"Can definitely taste the 12 year ""mystery"" bourbon in it!  Check the mash bill...most likely a 12 year old 1792!  Delicious"
