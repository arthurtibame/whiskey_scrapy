4.5,"Very good stuff. Has notes of berries, cherries, dark chocolate, citrus, dandelions, mangoes, pineapples, peat, dandelions, bananas, and peppers. Has some of that hampden estate Jamaican rum funk. The one 
thing holding back this dram is it can be rough around the edges at times but smoothens over time"

4.0,"This Kilkerran is a 10-year-old that was part of the penultimate pair of releases in the years leading up to the debut of the distillery's permanent 12-year bottling. The nose has typical sherry notes of raisins, brown sugar and orange rind. In the mouth, it's a little one-dimensionally sherry-flavored at first but opens up after a while to reveal more distinct hints of orange, carrot cake and sweet tea. The finish is generously long and tangy. It's a very tasty whisky once it's had some time to relax, but it's more about the wood than the spirit and doesn't appear to share any obvious DNA with the 12-year."
