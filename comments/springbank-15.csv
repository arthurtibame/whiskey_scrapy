4.0,If you like your whiskies to challenge you with complex flavours and aromas Springbank is a good bet. The 15yo is fruity and sweet from the sherry casks balanced well with seasalt and heather. And the more you try it the more it will have to offer.

5.0,"Uncorked this one tonight for the first time and poured a lively russet liquid into my glass; the aroma took a while to lift from the glass but once it did, I smelled sour brininess, salted pecan, the inside of my Fossil messenger bag, and lighter notes of vanilla and plantains; it delivers a nice maritime feeling with the first taste, and along with more leather I taste smoked trout and leeks, sour cherries, frangipane, rooibos, and cinnamon candy—overall the mosaic palate of this dram reminds me of a sweet red onion jam; the mouthfeel is chewy and astringent, leading to a sherry stickiness; splendid cinnamon finish with an aftertaste full of malt, gentle peat, sea salt, and cough syrup; an involving, enveloping experience altogether that I look forward to exploring more! Update: I'm about halfway through this precious bottle, and — having mellowed out only slightly on the front end and being yet more voluptuous on the finish — I can say that this is my favorite single malt Scotch to date."

4.0,"-Cheers to Damon for sharing this- Although very different, I found similarities from the 12 yr green. The nose is deceiving as it tells lies of a one dimension sherried whiskey; grape juice, red fruits, oak, frangipane, a mild sugar sweetness, pecan pie. The palate agrees with the nose with pomegranate, fresh crisp cranberries, grape juice tannins, wax, and a smooth smokiness. The truth is told in the finish where I found pretzel, salt, cheese brine, smoked cheese (specifically brie). Don't be fooled into thinking this is just a sweet scotch, it's very much savory one. I'll be making plans to visit again, so be ready to pour this one Damon!"

4.0,Nosing the scotch lets you come away with a pronounced fruitiness.  Fruity along with a heavy wood flavor comes through in the tasting.  The peaty flavor is mild and just background.  I love Ardbeg's peaty flavor however Springbank flavor is equally as cherished.

The label looks like something from Staples, the cork is well let's just say it's functional and the box is certainly made of car sales mens recycled business cards. The thing is they could ship this in an old sock and I'd still be mesmerized. I'm less than 2 years into my whiskey journey so I'm not entirely sure what is happening here but I know there is a lot to this and that there is something important happening here. There is smoke and sweetness and creaminess and dried dark fruits and there is this mind blowing wave of a flavour I have yet to pin point that hits your palate a second after arrival that is utterly unlike anything I have experienced in any whiskey before. I look forward to trying to peel back the layers here and while it is frustrating for my new and feeble sensibilities to discern I am thrilled to be on the journey.

5.0,"The Bottle: Springbank has recently changed the labeling on the majority of their bottles(with questionable results, if I'm honest), but this review is for the older style with the embossed lettering on the black label.  Simple, classy, straight-forward.  

In The Glass: Picture light apple juice.

On The Nose: Ahh Springbank, you sexy devil you.  The nose on this does not disappoint.  Sweet & salty, like eating candied almonds on a boat.  Salt water taffy.  Peanut confection.  In the backdrop there is the typical Springbank ""savory"" thing that defines the 10 year-old, but it's more restrained here.

Taste: A good follow-through from the nose.  I am instantly reminded of when I was a kid and I saw a small circus display on a beach while chewing on a piece of caramel.  The sweet & salt leads the way here with a strong nutty finish.  I think that this would pair fantastically with food.  This isn't a whisky that you need to have on it's own, this one was made to have with dinner...and then again with dessert.
Despite spending 15 years in sherrywood, this isn't a Speyside bomb.  If you're expecting Aberlour or even a Glendronach, you may want to reconsider :).  The sherry here is the bass player, not the lead guitarist.
This is distinct, nuanced and tasty.

This is my favorite of the Springbank line, and possibly my favorite non-Islay single malt Scotch."

4.5,No. 2 whisky for the night in my new local whisky bar. Coming off the back of the Oban Little Bay this really made an impact. I liked it's 18 year old brother but I'm thinking this might actually be better.  It's got that signature oily complex sherry vegetation flavour type mix. I was chatting to someone whilst drinking so couldn't pay close attention to the components (not that I'm good at separating them anyhow) but I do know a complex multifaceted dram when I taste one and this is it. It's 3 year older brother goes for an approx 2/3rds price premium in NZ ($80USD vs $140USD) and from memory  I really don't see it as worth it. I'll have to get a bottle of this and compare to the unopened 18 year and double check.

5.0,"This whisky....it confuses me. Greatly. Because there is one note in there, on the nose and in the taste, that I can't for the life of me identify, and that I never had in any other whisky. Ever. Almost like hot oily bathwater....thermal batchhouses..that direction. Weird. Very weird. But by god this stuff is delicious. I think this is one of the first samples that made me go ""I NEED A BOTTLE OF THIS, NOW!"". Well...on to notes. As far as I can make out what they are. Nose has some decent smoke, together with that weird sour bathwater pinewood mix and some brine. Definatly something woody in there. Taste starts with smoky saltwater, more of those weird notes, dark fruits, burnt brown sugar (surprisingly sweet...then again, sherry cask...) and....nuts? Macadamia? Sounds about right. Aftertaste is salty, nutty fudge. Amazing. To be honest, Springbank was advertised to me as ""like Islay, but doesn't know your safeword"". It's actually not that brutal...I'd go so far as to put it above Ardbeg and Laphroaig in my ranking. I think my local store might even have some springbank...not sure if it was the 15 tho, but I'm gonna find out tomorrow. I need more of this."
4.0,A good combo of sherry sweetness and mild peat. Good value considering how much more the 18 is
4.0,"In all these years, I did never come across a bad bottling of Springbank. The 15-year-old expression is more sherried, and surprisingly peaty compared to its younger brother. On the nose, you get smoked salmon, confectionery and pipe tobacco. Hints of damp earth, cough syrup and parsley linger in the back. The taste is strong, austere and a bit fizzy with fresh ginger, orange peel and mineral peat smoke. Almost like a distant dream of Islay, whispering farewell in its long and slightly dry finish. Altogether, this is a rewarding Single Malt and a great value!

5.0,"Although it is aged entirely in sherry casks, there is a strong briny peat that overrides any of the overt sweetness that usually accompanies such aging. This aged Springbank is still the down to earth, good product of a small Campbeltown distillery. The peat is unique -- not as overriding and dominant as with  Laphroaig, Ardbeg or even Talisker. It's a different peat, tasting of fields of worked grains, mixed with astringent diesel and metallic notes. It is not an easy drink. It is not for the Scotch drinker trying to avoid a challenge. There is layer upon layer here, and a drinker can just picture the peating, the turning of the barley, the heat of the roasting floor when sipping a dram of this taste of Scotland. For anyone who has ever been to Scotland: this is a taste that somehow captures -- unromantically -- what it feels like to stand in a burn inhaling the heather and salt sea air in a single breath. This single malt delivers a challenge; with that challenge comes a reward. Much like its younger brother -- the twelve-year-old -- it is a delicious, unpretentious, and unapologetic dram. If you want a true taste of Scotland -- not the overly refined and tamed tastes of Macallan, not the overly cleansed tastes of any of the chill-filtered Scotch malts or blends -- then tip your Glencairn towards Campbeltown and enjoy the immersion into Springbank."

4.0,"Dinner out, and bought myself a pour.  At $8 /pour, a pretty good value for money.  This is surprisingly so very different than the 10.  I expected a difference of course, but this is nothing derived from the likes of the 10.  The earthy soot is replaced by more of a sweeter floral profile with just a wisp of smoke.  Tasted blind, I’d peg this for a Speysider.  One of my favorite distilleries; can’t ever go wrong with a Springbank.  Just a question of whether it’s good or excellent."

4.5,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #5

I've been meaning to review this for ages but it has been a while since I last had a bottle, so sitting with a dram of it in Cadenhead's tasting room in Campbeltown seems the ideal time.

The 15 is aged entirely in Sherry casks (many types) instead of a combination of bourbon and Sherry as is the case with the 10 year old. At heart it is very like the 10 year old but with a more fruity and round character. Also more coconut, toasted cereal, caramel and leather. The sherry influence permeates the distillate rather than covering it like a winey blanket. It's the same elegant act displayed in Old Pulteney 21 and Glenfarclas 15.

I think of the Springbank 10 and 15 year olds as being different facets of the same new-make spirit rather than an older and younger brother. The vegetal, fruity, mineral and briny notes are all still there in the 15, but there is also a more relaxed and autumnal feel. Buy a bottle and enjoy one of the great experiences in whisky.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

4.5,"I still remember climbing a few short steps to get a look inside of Springbank’s century old mash tun. A hundred years of patina creates a black void that stretches for miles. A similarly aged spirit safe contains enough copper oxidation to compete with New England’s oldest weathervanes. And dunnage style aging forms a mineral infused atmosphere that saturates the wood year after year. This combination of molecules cannot be simulated short of the time necessary to produce them. Factor in traditional malting floors and it all results in a whisky so distinctive it might easily be recognized in a blind tasting of a hundred drams. The first alcoholic whiff brings me back to the bottling room where a handful of industrious people still apply labels by hand and inspect each bottle individually. Subtle peat smoke recalls images of a noble kiln that’s weathered by decades of usage. Sweet vanilla and malted barley are accompanied by an earthy, oaken, sulfurous, farmland personality that’s unmistakable.  An oily palate translates the sweetness into both fresh picked and dried fruits, toffee, salted nuts, prickly pepper, and cocoa bean.  A wonderful, lengthy finish turns up dry Fino sherry, more pepper, and a final hint of cabbage water…..all spectacular. If it weren’t for my blatant Islay prejudice, I might safely rate this at 5 stars.  :)"

On the finish, there’s an interesting cheesy note at the end that I loved. A drop of water opened everything up, leading to a long, dry peppery finish with more dark chocolate.

4.25,"info: Pour continuer dans cette gamme de Sherry-Tourbé, je m'attaque donc à ce 15 ans d'âge de Springbank. Alors, que l'on parlait de PX pour le Lagavulin 16, ici on parle de fût d'Oloroso. 

Nez: Sucre brun et tourbe sale. Quelque chose de sucré-salé. Sel Marin. Une odeur chimique ou plastique... similaire à la tourbe goudronneuse de Ardbeg. Un aspect fruité. Des pommes vertes et des raisins.

Bouche: Une belle touche de tourbe! Pas immense. Une tourbe qui n'écrase pas le reste. Mais la présence est assez affirmé afin qu'elle soit décisive. Il faut aimé ce genre de tourbe sinon on n'aime pas. Une touche de chêne, une touche de feuille de tabac, des touche de vanille et de chocolat au lait. Le sucre brun est maintenant du chocolat. Un fruit noir et profond. Des figues? Des mures? Ça ferait un bon pairing avec un cigare. Texture huileuse. 

Finale: retour du sel et de l'amertume de plastique ou de goudron ou de tabac... ou peut-être de cuivre. Raisin et pomme. 

Overall: J'aime bien cette expression de Springbank. Je ne peux pas dire que j'ai apprécier particulièrement les autres éditions que j'ai eu la chance de goûté. Cette tourbe plastique doit s'harmoniser pour être agréable. Le 10, le 12 CS et le 18 m'ont semblé moins bien équilibré que celui-ci (bien que ce n'est pas toujours un défaut en soit). L'équilibre entre les fruits, le sucre, l'amertume, la tourbe et le sel me semble particulièrement bien réussi. J'ai beau réfléchir, je ne peux trouver un comparatif aromatique dans le même genre. Celui la et le 12 CS sont les seules que je rachèterai. Le premier pour l'originalité et l'équilibre aromatique justement. Le deuxième (12 CS) pour le punch au visage. Bref, pour ceux qui savent qu'ils aiment ce type de tourbe, c'est un no-brainer. Pour les amateurs qui ne se sont pas encore aventuré dans ce champs d'arôme, je suggère de gouter avant pour savoir si c'est votre style. Pour ma part, ça passe le teste! 87%"
5.0,"Natural gold color, not chill filtered, medium to high viscosity. Nose is complex, with fruit, black pepper, lemon zest, and smoke on the back. Palate is rich and round, with sweet notes of tropical fruit, vanilla, oak, leather, caramel, cereal, and sherry intermingled with pleasant and mild pit fire smoke. Finish is long, dominated by fruit, lemon zest, and vanilla, with a slight hint of smoke on the back. This is bottled at 46% ABV, and a teaspoon of water intensifies sweetness, adds banana notes, and somewhat changes the finish with more lemon zest lingering flavors. Overall, an excellent dram, just like it’s younger cousin the 10-year-old. I can’t say one is better than the other, but 15-year-old appears to have a little less smoke and bit more subtle complexity. Both are phenomenal whiskies."

2.25,"So my least favorite springbank ever, a few drams in what will i think tonight.

Nose - OK first off, I'm smelling this like crazy just from the pour.  OK so sherry, oak, BBQ sauce, and sulfur.  My first thoughts when I opened this reminded me of a baby diaper that my dog ate as a kid.  Now I'm getting more sweet and bbq vs that but it's still there in the back ground.  I get a touch of vinegar, touch of salt.  

Taste - Springbank funk, BBQ (citrus bbq?), nice oaks, salty, savory. No smoke no fruity notes either.  Ok so it's more mesquite if that makes sense.  Still i get some of that baby diaper stuff, of sulfur.  

You know this is crazy but this bottle has been open well over a year and I gotta say, it has finally lost the REALLY off putting notes and those off notes now aren't a problem at all.  I still don't love this one and it's still not my springbank of choice.  

This is a HARD one to score because it's so insanely complex, it's SPRINGBANK, and it's down right good casks, but I get those odd flavors.  I however know the quality here and accept some issues.  As a result an insanely low score for springbank but still a pickup if you're a fan."

4.25,"NOSE: Flowers, peanuts, dates, toffee, salted pretzels.

PALATE: Hot for 46%. Dark burnt caramel and blood orange. Clove spice. Pleasing milk chocolate finish.

OVERALL: Very different from the 10. The nose is heavy and dark from sherry casks. The salty twang is still there to keep it Springbank."

4.5,"This review is for a bottle from 2016.

I just cannot bring myself to vacation anywhere cold.  I like tropical places.  What is the Scotch to have in your swim trunks at these locations?  Springbank 15.  No ice.

Somehow, the 100% ex-sherry casks that are used to mature this whisky impart flavors of tropical fruits: papayas, strawberry jam, guava.

This is a dirty sherry maturation, which works just fine with Springbank.  You get the most funk for your buck if you drink this in a hot environment.  A dank, earthy, swampy miasma just rises out of the glass to complement the sweetness.  There’s some blue cheese, game meat, and rain-ruined leather in there as well.  The Springbank distillate is made for sherry casks.  I like this one much better than the 10 or the 18.

Score: ** (unimaginably good)
How much does a bottle cost: $95-130
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $180"
4.0,"Malty, fruity nose. Banana, vanilla, honey. Rich and slightly sticky mouth feel. Mildly briny, astringent finish."

4.25,"Representing campbeltown

Nose: sherry, apricot, flower petals, light oak, caramel, honey and a boozy orange - reminds me of a macallan nose, a fruity malt nose. 

Body: thin, oily

Palate: mild spice, caramel and light malt

Finish: medium with malt and nuttiness perhaps a burnt maltiness. Later into the drink tobacco smoke lingered and lingered and was warming and just real nice. Really liked the finish. 

Note: a very smooth dram, very nice, easy to drink, really good not quite great though but really really good"
4.5,"Dates, Salt, ripe red fruit, brine, peat, long salty and smokey finish. Dark cherries (almost like cherry coke)"

4.0,"Big, bold scotch. Great balance of smokiness, Oak, dried fruits, etc."
4.25,"Fantastic! This has a lot going on but somehow for me it’s soft then a hint of spice but then falls into cereal, and slightly burnt caramel I think. There is some fruit notes that I haven’t pinpointed yet. Can’t stop thinking about this expression. Fun and enjoyable dram. Well done Springbank!"

4.5,Rich caramelized sugar a tropical tang in the background. The finish is full of chocolate with a hint of pineapple. While the nose is 4 stars the taste is mildly better however the finish is sublime I just opened this but I have to say 4.5.
4.25,"Deep gold in the glass, with copper highlights, very dense.
On the nose a light alcoholic puncture (which vanishes almost immediately) leads the way to the sherried notes of the whisky: raisins, marzipan, a pinch of vanilla. Initially a little closed, to let it breathe it reveals a splash of (sea) salt accompanied by dark chocolate and spices, and a vinous, almost marshalate profile is amalgamated.
The palate is immediately intriguing: a sweetly smoky mouth slips into the mouth, an elegant cherry and chocolate paste with a clear peppery connotation. Candied fruit (orange and, Behold!, cherry), still marzipan and that vinous and marsala profile perceived by the nose which becomes more decisive and fuller here. The smoke is really a hint, a drizzle of peat that curls on the flavors giving an extra twist. The alcoholic strength is perfect: the more it would have been intrusive, the less it would have softened the aromas.
The finish is long, the tannic and vinous part is the master with the memory of Mon Chéri."

4.25,"Oh so much going on here.

The nose is all nuts and ginger with a touch of Christmas spice. The taste adds chocolate and caramel. There is sherry but as a supporting artist. Fruit for me is sultanas and raisens. Flavours just roll around inside your mouth and the finish is long.

A lot of tastes here I will have to try a few more drams to have any chance of doing this justice. I'll also add a drop of water just because!

Loving this. Set to become a favourite."

4.5,"Perfect harmony between sherry and peat. Incredibly complex you'll find a different experience with every dram you pour. If you see this bottle on the shelf just buy it. This is the ""stranded on the island with only one"" Scotch."

4.25,"Wow, this is a great whisky. Didn't know what to expect since i haven't had any Campbeltown whiskies before. 

Comes at 46%abv, with a pale gold color.

On the nose is very complex, starts with spices that tingle your nose, then changes to citrus notes like oranges, plum, all wrapped up in a slight peatyness; the it changes again into a sweet aroma, like Dark Chocolate and Vanilla Cookies with cream. If you let it sit for minutes while aprecciating its aroma, tobacco notes will also appear on the nose. Very Complex and interesting.

On the palate is more normal, But surprisingly smooth. It has Oaky notes, Hotness, spicyness, Dry grasses, tobacco, apricot peel. 

Full bodied, mouth watering, makes you move your tongue to fully grab it all. nice experience. The finish is long and satisfying, with spices and a little hotness. Great dram, one of the best this year so far. 89 out of 100."

1.5,"Sweet, dried dark fruits and spices, but overwhelmed by a charred oak taste.  Very full bodied and tannic.  The aftertaste is a kind of sour ash that stays around for ages."
4.5,"Nose - honey, sweet light peat smoke, grass/hay, pear, sweet apple, very little ethanol burn. 

Taste - thick, viscous honey, vanilla, hay, pear, caramel, grape syrup, brine, cereal, sweet cream, light oak, sweet peat smoke, milk chocolate, with very little burn (manifests as a grape-like sourness), finishing long, creamy, and delightfully sweet.

It’s delicious."
