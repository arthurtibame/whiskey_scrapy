null,This is the worst thing I have ever tasted.  I drink different bourbons every night and some aren’t great and I’ll use as a mixer.  With this one I flushed it straight down the drain.  Smelled and tastes of peanut butter gone bad with a hint of metal after taste.  Sorry if you like this one but not my favorite

3.5,"Nose: Sassifras all day. Medicinal with hints of old time soda pop and single malt. 
Pallet: 100% delivers on the nose. Also, hints of anise, smoke, and rye...in that order.
Finish: long and smooth. Black licorice, smoke and licorice.
Leaves you curious and wanting another sip. Medicinal, but with overtones of scotch, cola, and smoke."
