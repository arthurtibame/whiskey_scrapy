3.5,"I was fortunate enough to get a sample of this rare and very hyped rye release. I sampled batch 1 which is a blend of MGP sourced Rye bottled at a cask strength of 112.2 proof. It's an NAS release due to it being a blend of younger and older stock. It's released by 2/3 of the partnership that brought you the Kentucky Owl releases and is exclusive to KY (hence the crazy hype) Let's see how it tastes:

On the palette it's rich, hot and very fruity for a rye. Peaches and citrus flavors to go with oak and some leather. This carries thru the mid palette and leads to a longish pecan, oak and citrus driven finish. It's pretty tasty overall but honestly not ""special"" in anyway to me. Sure it's got good complexity too it but it doesn't really stand out from other decent MGP cask strength offerings. 
In conclusion I am very happy to have tasted, but this one just simply isn't worth paying over the odds for ($300+). Cheers all!"
