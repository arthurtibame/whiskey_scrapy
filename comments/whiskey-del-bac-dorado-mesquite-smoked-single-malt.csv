4.0,"One of the most unique whiskeys I've had the pleasure of drinking. Smoky and rich, like they bottled the essence of barbecued brisket, with all the sweetness you'd expect of a good malt whiskey. This is far from an everyday sipper for me, but it is great to drink on occasion and goes extremely well in a Sazerac. ($50)"

5.0,"This whiskey is no southern bell. This is a Calamity Jane kinda whiskey. So if you want to get tossed around just a bit...she’s your kinda girl.
They’ve dialed in the mesquite smoke
since their first batch. Allowing the oak spices, brown sugar, cherry pie and vanilla to come through on the nose and not just MESQUITE SMOKE. I’m always left with a big whiff of sweet pipe tobacco before I take my first sip.
Don’t worry, the smoke comes through on the palate. But, again. Unlike other mesquite smoked whiskeys, they have really learned how to find their balance and not just smoke out all the other flavors.
Mesquite BBQ, leather, jerky, and crem brûlée burnt sugar, and a flavor that only kids who grew up climbing mesquite trees will recognize...mesquite sap and bark dust. 
Such intriguing stuff"
4.0,"vanilla and cherry bbq. smoky, but not overpowering. more on the aftertaste. pleasant."
4.0,Oddly enough this whiskey encouraged me to venture into more Islay.  Del Bac Dorado has a most delightful nose.  The mesquite gives notes of bbq and desert like a dry breeze in Saguaro National Park. Small casks and Arizona heat produce a whiskey in a short period of time which may impact the relatively short finish. Spice and heat on the palette and gentle mesquite on the finish.  Absolutely worth a try.
4.0,"The mesquite flavor is very subtle, and very pleasant. It’s most noticeable on the nose. Definitely adds a unique twist to what you would normally expect from a single malt."
4.0,Way smoky. super hard to find. only available in NYC and Tucson AZ.

4.25,"Nose: smoke, barbecued meat, apricots, caramel
Taste: smoke dominates, not finding the sweetness 
Finish: not much beyond the smoke, not dry and not much burn
After reading reviews: tobacco on the nose makes sense but I don’t find chocolate, nor can I get chili/spicy notes beyond the smoke on the taste"
4.75,"Now that I’ve acquired a proper bottle of this stuff it’s time to do a proper review. 

Boy do I love mesquite smoked single malt. I feel like nothing captures the spirit of the American West like this style of whiskey. I already have a bottle of the Colkegan from New Mexico and High West Campfire from Utah, and now with this bottle from Arizona, I’m closer to the smokey four corners collection (looking your way Colorado. Maybe Stranahans has something cooking up...). 

The nose here is just beautiful. Mouth watering even. The mesquite is more present here than on the Colkegan, I suspect because of a higher percentage of smoked barley. I get meaty, briskety note along with campfire, a little leather, and an almost creamy note. 

Taste brings just the right amount of smoke along with a coating, creamy mouthfeel. Letting it sit on my palate a while reminds me of the last cigar I smoked (which was admittedly a long time ago. One vice at a time...). The finish lingers and leaves a warm embery glow in your mouth enticing you to go back for more. I didn’t add water because it went down plenty easy at 45%.   

A little hard to find (one liquor store in all of Austin had it), but definitely worth the effort. Their brand rep at the tasting I attended said they’re starting to expand their distribution further so hopefully it shows up on y’alls shelves at some point in the near future. Cheers!"

5.0,"Wild west whiskey... oh yeah! Blazing sun, blazing guns, outlaws, and horse-trail camp-fire grub. These Del Bac guys have without a doubt captured part of Arizona in these here bottles of Dorado.

The aromas of mesquite smoked meat and savory molasses baked beans jump out of the glass at you. Just like walking into the eatin’ joint up at Tortilla Flats after searching for the Lost Dutchman mine all day, or something like that. Also a hint of a hint of mint;) Quite nice.

A bourbon-esque palate, but without the dill note I get in a lot of bourbons...but not bourbon, after all it is a single malt.  I suspect the juice is laid down in charred virgin oak barrels by the profile of its rich taste and its deep red-brown-copper color. A sweet arrival of brown sugar and charred marshmallow with tobacco and dark chocolate and saddle leather balancing it out.

Dorado leaves you with whispers of ashy smoke, like a dying campfire late in the desert evening.

Well, many thanks to the fellas down in Tuscan at Hamilton Distillers. Mighty fine job there partner, a mighty fine job indeed."
4.5,"N - fall spice, tobacco, slight vanilla

T- a meaty bbq smoke, wood spice, dark chocolate and some cherry sweetness 

F - a bit astringent, dry leather and lingering smoke 

So glad my home state Arizona is coming out with a smokey single malt like this. Does really give you a desert campfire feel. Less salty and earthy than Scotland peat but still packs a smokey tobacco punch. If you can get ahold of it, it is certainly something unique to try."
4.75,"Went to a Del Bac tasting tonight with their brand ambassador. Tried several of their expressions and I can say that each of their expressions has a unique flavor profile. 

The Dorado was by far my favorite. Layers of mesquite smoke, a round and creamy and caramely taste on the back end of the palate and an incredibly long and satisfying finish. Can’t wait for this one to come to Texas!"
4.0,"Nose is primarily smoke, with hints of oak and a little spice. Taste is similar, mostly smoke, although more of a dry, chile-inspired smoke than you would expect; hints of caramel. Smooth going down, finish is mostly chili peppers and more smoke on the tongue. Easy to sip, makes me want to sit by a bonfire."
4.0,"Smoky and woody then sweet, smooth."
4.5,"Neat.  Nose is mesquite, vanilla, butterscotch, and a little ethanol  Taste is honey/barley sweet, vanilla, tobacco, cinnamon, then a long mesquite/BBQ flavor with a saccharine campfire finish.

I've never tasted anything like this before. It's absolutely delicious and brings back memories of camping and bonfires.  Think of this as an American Islay.  I think a Bourbon or Scotch fanatic could appreciate this"

2.75,"It has a super smoked smell - like that woody smoke for smoking meat (hickory, mesquite, cherry). This is a totally weird drink based on smell. It's meaty and sweet and smokey and herbal (some licorice is in there). It's fascinating. The flavor is a bit subdued, as is standard for American Single Malts. It's very rich with a lot of that woody smoke. If you're looking for something meaty, this is a good choice. There is some definite spiciness going on here, making this a bit harsh. It would be great if there were a bit less of that. There's a little apple going on here and there are also some chipotles. There's herbal notes given the smoke more robustness It's very interesting and rich, but it's a bit too in your face, sort of like Laphroaig 10, but sweeter with more of a smokey wood flavor that includes some black peoper and rounds it out. It's still weird though. There is sort of some balance but also this disjointed element where cereal comes through and it becomes a normal single malt.
Coming off of low-grade bourbon and brandy, this has an appealing meaty smokiness with some allusions to peat on the nose. The palate is still very smoky with strong bitter elements that are reminiscent of peat, but it's not inherently bad. The sweetness is there and it balances the meatiness well. This reminds me a bit of Lagavulin 16, but it is not as well balanced. I get rendered pork mixed with cherry, apple, and liquid smoke. There are some other flavors of minerals, flowers, mild herbs, and so on, but I want to pause on that liquid smoke flavor because the problem is that it tastes artificial rather than like char from a barbeque. There's also some more sweet and fruity elements than makes sense for such a smoky drink that is trying to be meaty. It isn't bad, but it isn't a great sipper.
This is not great in comparison with other malt whiskey, but it's actually pretty good following bourbon. It's sweeter with a lighter caramel taste them most bourbon and it also has some floral and light fruit notes that suggest Irish whiskey (but are not excessive), but it's also very smoky with a bitter herbal kick. In that mindset, it's not bad, but it is still harsh with some flavors that don't marry super well. It tastes a bit young. Mixed with some more lightly toasted American Oak, this might be really good. As it is, there is a nice finish, but it will punch your taste buds silly."

null,"Tonight we're gonna try something different. In light of standalone tasting notes and a rating, I thought I'd take varying combinations of the bottles in my collection and those of my friends and do an occasional head-to-head series, where I taste and compare two bottles of similar provenance that often get lumped together in the same category (think heavily peated scotches or barrel proof bourbons). Hopefully this helps you, the reader, to decide which bottle is best for you if you are faced with choosing between two equally delicious but different options. Tonight's lineup:

Whiskey Del Bac vs. Colkegan

Category: American Single Malt
Style: Mesquite Smoked Single Malt
Age: 2-3 years old
Price Point: $50-60 USD
Tasting Setting: Neat, Glencairn glass, rested for 5 minutes before nosing, both bottles approximately half full 

Nose: The nose on the Colkegan is subtle, gentle. There's an earthy, grassy quality to it, with just a wisp of smoke, belying what is underneath, and right at the end is a minty/menthol note. The Del Bac by comparison comes bellowing out of the glass with a meaty, briskety aroma leaving nothing to the imagination as to what you're about to experience. To compare it to a peated single malt, the Colkegan is reminiscent of Caol Ila, and the Del Bac is Lagavulin.

Palate: Colkegan arrives gently, with a creamy mouthfeel. There's a lower percentage of smoked malt in this one, and it's aged at a higher altitude than Del Bac (Santa Fe vs. Tucson). The smoke shows up on the mid-palate on the Colkegan, but it doesn't overwhelm the malt, but rather is integrated, again, like Caol Ila. When the Del Bac hits your tongue, you get a big blast of that mesquite smoke. It's like walking into a smoky Texas BBQ pit where they've been smoking meat non-stop since the 19th century. It coats your mouth, and while you can taste the malt in this one too, the smoke is much more prevalent without being drying. 

Finish: The Del Bac lingers on your palate for a while, which is curious since Colkegan has a slightly higher ABV (45% vs. 46% respectfully). The smoke from Del Bac isn't drying, but it has a slightly numbing effect as it sits in your throat, which keeps the smoke on your palate longer. The Colkegan doesn't linger quite as long, and the smoke dissipates before the finish. What you're left with is a lovely, malty aftertaste similar to and Irish single malt or Lowland Scotch.  

Final Thoughts: Two excellent malts! You can't go wrong with either, but it's unwise to think these two are the same, no more than two malts from Islay are. The Del Bac is for those of you who love big, bold, smoky malts like Lagavulin, Ardbeg, or Laphroaig. The Colkegan is more the speed of Caol Ila, Highland Park, or BenRiach, where the smoke is more equally integrated throughout the dram. These two are often held up as the standard bearers of Mesquite Smoked American Single Malt, though there are other up and comers, such as Andalusia Stryker and Ranger Creek Rimfire. In terms of availability, I don't believe either one currently (as of January 2020) has national, much less international distribution. I bought the Colkegan while on a business trip in Albuquerque, and I had my local whisky shop special order the Del Bac for me (which is a luxury I'm afforded by living in whisky-crazy Austin, TX). There's a lot of competition for your whisky dollar, especially from the craft corner, and I feel like a lot of them aren't good VFM. These two are. When the craft distilling bubble inevitably bursts sometime this decade, I see these two surviving. They're among the best of the American Single Malts, and I predict that the southwest will be to American Single Malt one day what Islay and the Islands are to Scotch. Good hunting, and enjoy the journey!"

1.0,"To be fair, they basically just started making whisky and for the short time they do it, they are doing okay. 
That being said, Del Bac is a perfect example to show that making good Scotch needs decades of experience and they just don't have that yet. Also, there is a huge difference between aging and maturing. With their small barrels, they can mature their whisky in less than a year but by no means is it well aged. As with baking bread, time is an ingredient that cannot be substituted.
Del Bac is just not ready for prime time, at least not for serious whisky lovers. It can hold its water against a $20 blend from your super market but falls fast and far behind anything else. 
I will give this a try again in a decade, when they have more experience and moved to bigger barrels and longer aging."

3.5,"Nose: Smokey but not peaty, nutmeg, vanilla.

Palate: more smoke, cinnamon, and maybe a hint of toffee, smooth texture on the tongue.

Finish: Spicey and a little peppery."
3.75,"Smell is over alluring with heavy smoke and some warm spiced notes. Tastes heavily of smoke but the after taste is reminiscent of the mesquite, very pleasing."
4.25,"Nose: Smoke, sweet maple, chard brisket, pungent fruit. 

Taste: Bitter smoke, meat, mint, hot and spicy BBQ sauce, black pepper, sea salt. 

Experience: Sitting down for mesquite smoked BBQ on a hot dusty day. You are sweating as you eat it but you forget the heat as the savory sweet food takes all your attention. 

This whiskey is like it's home state. Incredibly interesting while often overlooked for not being what most people think they want.  It stands out as an example that American whiskey can be more than bourbon while still competing with the complexity of Scotch. Wish more distilleries had Hamilton's balls."

3.0,"Quite smoky. Not smooth, has a real bite. 
Excellent for a change of pace."
1.25,"A sample as part of the ""whiskey transfer program"" from dthom.  I'm leery here as I don't like peaty whiskey (sorry peat heads!) and this was sold to me as ""smokey without the peat"".  I always taste peat as burned plastic so I can't get past it.

Nose: Very smokey and sweet.  Like BBQ that is cooking in someone's backyard.  Some wood and dark sugars.

Flavor:  Dark sugars and sweet BBQ rub.  It tastes like the rub I use on my ribs.  The smoke is so overpowering I can't get anything else.

Finish:  No clue.  My palate was so overwhelmed with Mesquite smoke flavors that I couldn't tell anything else.  Not balanced at all.
  
Sorry guys...I hate this.  This whiskey isn't a touch of smoke but all smoke.  Any good flavor that I thought I was catching was quickly overwhelmed by Mesquite."
3.75,"Definitely mesquite smoked, but less smoke than an islay, and a nice fruity base with a noticeable barrel back end."
4.75,"American single malt craft distilleries can be a hit and miss.  Some are decent.  Most are bad.  But all are pretty much bad VFM.  Even the good ones are pretty bad VFM ( Westland Garryana, case and point). This one here is an exception.  It’s sent courtesy from my southwestern buddy @dubz480.  

Aroma is amazing.  Morning after campfire.  Ashes and burnt wood, with that distinct smoke smell.  Taste is mesquite BBQ smoke ribs.  In liquid form.  This is what Balcones wished it tasted like. 

This is probably my new favorite American single malt.  Move over Westland, Wyoming, Stranhan’s,  Balcones, and countless others.  There’s a new American single malt king

.  @dubz480 thanks!  I’m buying a bottle"

4.5,"Tonight I have the pleasure of reviewing the best malt to hail from my home state of Arizona! Not only is it the best malt to come out of Arizona but I'd argue it's one of the best American malts period when you factor in price. So let's find out a little bit more about it:

1) It's distilled and aged in Tucson, AZ by Hamilton Distillery.
2) It's non chill filtered and bottled at 90 proof
3) It follows the Scottish model of utilizing 100% barley that is malted and smoked over a Mesquite wood fire (vs peat).
4) It's double distilled in copper pots (true grain to glass Distillery) 
5) Age is not disclosed

Let's move to the tasting notes:

On the palette its rich and quite oily. Upfront you get beef jerky and BBQ smoke. This gives way to grilled fruits and toffee. Tobacco and cocoa lead the mid palette with a long campfire smoke, sweet oak and soft tannins finish. It's slightly drying but in a good way. Finish lingers!
Wow, for a craft Whiskey this one really is excellent! They have managed to capture a Southwest BBQ in a bottle. The smoke is somewhere in-between an Islay (no maritime notes) and a Mezcal (not as ashy or earthy). There are fantastic sweet notes throughout that are so well balanced against the smoke! 
All this for just $44.99! For a grain to glass smoked American Single Malt! Truly a spectacular value!
For anyone who visits the Southwest USA, this is a must buy. For any fans of Islays or Mezcals seek this one out. 
Man this glass is hard to put down! Cheers all!"
