3.75,"Not to sure why I added batch 7 as it was Batch 10 i have so as I'm to lazy to add another entry here we go. 

Bunnahabhain and Adelphi. Two greats of the whisky world. Don't believe i've ever had a bad one from memory.

This is interesting. Bourbon casking not the usual sherry style I expect from both. It's a nice lovely dram. Light, white grape juice, citrus. Well crafted but not outstanding."
