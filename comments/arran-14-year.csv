5.0,"You can really taste the coastal influence in this malt, you keep a lovely salty taste in your mouth after each sip. Same flavour profile as the classic Laddie! I had different expectations because of the used sherry casks, I was expecting something much sweeter. A pleasant surprise I must say, glad I've decided to buy this bottle! Edit: becomes sweeter and more balanced after adding some water, great dram!"

4.0,"Nose: A very fresh cereal aroma with grapefruit, barley sugar and a soft underscore of armagnac. There are light floral touches, but also a lot of herbal and grassy notes - mint, crushed camelia leaves, sencha, freshly chopped ginger. As the nose develops bush orchid, honeydew melon and eucalyptus become apparent. A little oak in the background and a subtle cloud of brine that you don't notice until after the second or third sip. An interestingly different nose - floral, but not at all heavy or sweet - ""dry grassy floral"" if you will.

Palate: A citrus-sweet and slightly spicy arrival develops into a mouth-filling palate that is full of wonderful cereal and light fruit flavours. Milk chocolate, malt and stewed fruits, but there is a light touch overall. Rinsed preserved lemons and hazelnuts.

Finish: Medium, and turning satisfyingly salty. Some fruity and nutty flavours linger.

This is a very well balanced, creamy malt with a subtle but assured character, and for me the nose is the outstanding part of the performance. Really excellent, it rewards time and patience.

Water is not necessary, but a drop or two enhances the neat character. Adding a whole teaspoon changes the character more noticably, but in a good way. The nose becomes rounder and richer and the oak comes forward from it's supporting role in the background.

On the palate, adding water softens and enhances both the sweet and spicy flavours and in the finish it redefines the saltiness, turning it salt-sweet and making barley sugar the final flavour.

A class act overall, and deserving of a solid 4 stars. This is not a malt to hurry or even an everyday dram - it's one to ponder in the company of good music.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.0,"This lesser-known whisky from the Isle of Arran takes you on a fascinating journey of smell and taste. A tropical fruit basket with papaya, mango, pineapple and melon awaits the nose, enriched by aromatic spices, honey and cereals. It's quite complex! After an intense and citrusy arrival, the taste evolves floral and gingery with hints of sage, coriander and fructose. The oak kicks in nicely, leading to a robust and chocolaty bitter finish. For a mid-aged Single Malt, Arran 14 is really hitting the spot. It's a big event, an excellent value and highly recommended!

RATING: 4.0/5.0 stars ≙ 87 pts → FIRST-CLASS"

4.0,"I love this bottle more and more after each dram, quality stuff! Sweet, sour and salty with a wonderful nose. It packs a punch with the 46% ABV, no chillfiltration or added colour, I wish more distilleries would follow the example of Arran regarding this. Cheers all"

4.0,"Love the salty finish, makes me feel like I'm over there, the Scotch Islands!"
4.0,"Nose - Light, apples, dark honey, pomelo, light subtle spice, peach/nectarines.

Taste - Fresh apple, hint of pear, peach, pomelo pith, light white pepper tingle, hint of tea bitterness, honey.

Finish - Lingering tea bitterness, floral fruit, honeyed apple, light lingering spice.

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - Very pleasant dram, nice balance of floral & fruit, not overly complex but does its job well. Feels very summery and feels like it'd be great in a highball. This seems like it'd be a good ""intro"" Scotch for people too as there's nothing really offensive about it, easy to sip, might be a bit ""spicy"" for some palates, but some water should tame it out.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes, if price is right

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe, I'd pay up to $70 USD for a bottle"

3.0,"A pleasant whiskey that is more floral than it is fruit, and despite having had some contact with sherry casks, the final product is more aligned with ex-bourbon flavours. The nose is honeyed, with faint hints of citrus and a generous dose of summer flowers. The body and palate are light and lively, with the impression that you're drinking a young whisky. The dram finishes spicy and medium in length. Again, not bad."
3.0,Tried this in a tasting of several Arran whiskys and this was my 2nd favourite after the sauterne finish. Def broke the general rule I had that older is better when it comes to whisky as I didn't rate it's 18 brother as highly. Prob more of a 3.5 for me. Update a couple of years and many a great whisky later.  3.25 at best. Little flavour.

3.75,"Tonight's Whisky of the Night comes to us courtesy of the Isle of Arran! This is one that I have only recently seen in the AZ market and being a fan of island malts was excited to give it a try. Unpeated, unfiltered and bottled at 46% ABV with 12 yrs in Bourbon barrels and final 2 years in Sherry and 1st Fill Bourbon Casks. Let's dive into the tasting:

Lovely mouthcoating entry that's reminiscent of the Old Pulteney 17 (not as good but similar) entry. Honey and vanilla compliment peach and citrus notes. Candied ginger as well which leads to oak, pepper and sea breeze driven finish. The finish is astringent but oddly it works very well with the way this malt is constructed. 

All in all was surprised by this malt, I hear a lot it's a good value malt. I'd argue it's just a good malt period. 

Cheers All!"
3.5,"Poire pomme, alcool, assez court, pas au top"
3.75,"Saw this on sale for $52, seemed like a good value for a 14 yr and the 10 has good reviews. Non chill filtered and 92pf is a thumbs up Poured neat, nice coating of glass. Nose has buttered shortbread, rich malt, cinnamon applesauce and spiced oak. Pretty deep with only a trace of ethanol. Thick oily mouthfeel leads palate of creamy spicy malt with some apple, barley sugar and strong oak . Some heat and sizzle comes through but this is tasty scotch. Its aligned with Deanston 12 profile focusing more on the pure malt flavor with some surrounding accents. Finish is fading malt, some vanilla bean with sturdy oak that dries for some balance. Slightly bitter at end but not unpleasant. Great weight and powerpacked flavor make for an excellent single malt. Doesn't have the smoothness of older scotches(has some heat)and I would easily give the edge to Deanston but this is still upper level malt imo......87/100.......minor deduction for price and excess heat for a 14 yr"

4.0,"Arran tasting night at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 12 July 2019. Whisky #3

Nose: Clean barley malt and fragrant fruit are the immediate impressions. Peaches, mango, honeydew melon, baked apples, vanilla, ginger syrup and a hint of mint, however the aromas are more rounded than in younger Arran expressions. Here there is a sense that they have been stewed together to create a complex sweet sauce or glaze. There's also a cooked grapey note reminiscent of cognac or armagnac coming from the sherry casks.

Palate: A very sweet, creamy arrival followed by a rich, fruity and mouth-filling development. Crème brûlée and malt syrup, stewed fruits (apricots, peaches, nectarines and pears), orange conserve, hazelnut and toasted almonds.  The texture is excellently oily and creamy. It's the most obviously rich and fruity Arran palate and if there is a fault it is that it can seem one-note sweet after a while. Fortunately this is ameliorated by a touch of oaky tannin and some warm spice.

Finish: Medium/long. Sweet malt, fading to a slightly dry aftertaste with dry sherry and tannic notes, some nutmeg and salt.

Arran's 14 year old expression contains all of the elements that are notable in its younger whiskies, but here they are larger, more rounded, sweeter and richer. The characteristic distillery ginger and white pepper spice is much tamed here, and the fruity sweet notes are thick and unctuous. Water broadens the texture even further and is interesting, but not required.

The last expression of this I tasted was an older batch and it had a more herbal character. Arran has been steadily increasing the proportion of sherry-wood maturation in their whisky for some time now and the contemporary 14 year is notably more sherried and richer than in previous years. It's a change of profile, but the overall quality is of the same high level so I'm still giving it 4 stars.

Further to this, the official Distiller scope notes here are out of date. This expression is not bourbon-matured and then sherry-finished (which was the case a long time ago). It is a combination of 50% first-fill bourbon cask and 50% refill sherry hogshead, both components being fully matured in those woods for 14 years.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
3.5,"This is a nice whiskey. When I first opened the bottle it was a little tight and boring but it’s become more interesting as it’s opened up.

On the nose I get vanilla, caramel, hay, lychee, and macadamia nuts.

On the palate there’s modeling clay, papaya, marzipan, chewy caramels, sweet honeysuckle and light herbal notes.

The finish is oily and medium in length with more modeling clay and marzipan that lingers.

It’s not mind blowing but it’s really nice. It has become a whiskey that I turn to at the beginning of an evening when I’m planning to do a tasting flight. It has complexity and balance that helps warm up my palate without overloading my taste buds."

3.5,"Difficult to rate, more difficult to satisfy all readers on this one, because this is not for everyone. 

Shining gold color. 46%abv

On the nose you get a gentle aroma, not to penetrating, very perfumed for a 14 year old. Some notes i got (after putting my nose to a test):
Wet forest;  Some type of candy, Butterscotch candy. Hazelnut. Orange peel, and a piece of wood that in Ecuador beaches is popular to repel mosquitos when burned, called ""Palo santo"", which i took the liberty to search for the english term and i got, lignum vitae (not a term you expect everybody to know).

All that gentleness is lost in the palate. Because of its 46% abv, it is Super hot. Oak everywhere. Very woody, tastes like old wood.

Finish is long and hot. There is also the sensation of a strong mint coming from your insides when you exhale.

Adding a couple of drops of water released a peppery spice, making it more drinkable and pleasant, improving the experience widely. Nevertheless is still hot, still strong. It is so hot like drinking fire. Full bodied, fills your whole mouth. Very Malty, it is not for me, i should not have to add water to really enjoy a dram, that is my way of thinking. I know some people will love it, some will hate it. I found myself doing both."

4.5,"Bottled in 2017.

Arran needs to be highlighted as a distillery that is currently improving.  I still have a bottle of Arran 10 from 2013, and it is pretty bad.  So, even as recently as 7-8 years ago, this distillery was putting out bad whisky.  Now, they are releasing modern masterpieces.  The new 10, 14, and 18 year olds I have tried, and they are all great; but it is the 14 that is spellbinding.

Precision and complexity.  That’s difficult to pull off, but this whisky does that with a delicate balance of cream and green.  Vanilla custard.  Green apples and citrus with powdered sugar.  Kiwi and cucumber with caramel.  A welcomed sharp kick of ginger and sage on the finish with the soft oakiness reminiscent of a much more expensive Japanese whisky.  When sipping on this dram, it feels like a creation with real intention, like it was authored.

When buying, be sure to get the modern appearing bottles.  Unlike with most other distilleries, you want to avoid any dusty old-fashioned bottles.

Score: ** (unimaginably good)
How much does a bottle cost: $70-100
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $150"
