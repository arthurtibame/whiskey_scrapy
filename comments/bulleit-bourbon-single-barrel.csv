4.25,"Costco Store Pick, Gilbert AZ.

Nose: orchard fruits, nutmeg, candy corn, and a wood note that ain’t oak; it’s more like tree sap. Can get all up in there and whiff without singeing the nostrils, so points for that. 

On the palate big, juicy, fruit flavors. They are so well blended that when I try to pick the individual fruits out it becomes difficult but getting white grape, apple, pear, and strawberry. You know what this is? Fruit punch in bourbon form. Oak and some caramel brittle come in at the mid-palate, bringing balance. Finish is hard to describe; the flavor doesn’t change much, it just gets hotter. Not a bad thing by any means. 

Mouthfeel is oily and medium thickness. 

This is by far the fruitiest bourbon I have ever had, and it’s a delight. Very different from everything else in my cabinet. At the $54 I paid and clocking in at a solid 104 proof, it’s a winner for sure. If you like fruity bourbons or just want something off the beaten path, this could be your jam."

4.0,OHLQ pick. Just a real solid bourbon.
4.25,"Tasting:  2 oz. Neat in Glen Cairn this is Binny's Pick#5, high rye (36%) with yeast #3, distillate origin unknown, but likely Four Rose's by contract.

A delicious nose of caramel, strawberry, and orchard fruits.  The palate is like juicy fruit gum.  It is very well done.  It is coating but not thick, sweeter but not cloying.  There is a delightful note at the end of ripe summer peach that transitions into the finish that is long and lasting.

Overall:  This is a winner.  Normally I am iffy about Bulleit.  I don't like that they often mislead the origin of the distillate, and their business practices give me pause.... but this is about whiskey, not about feelings.  Given the fact that Bulleit uses 3 different yeasts, and a few different recipes this is suspiciously close to a 4rs OBSO single barrel in overall profile.  I know it isn't exactly the same because the mashbills are not exactly the same.....BUT given that Bulleit's contract distiller historically has been Kirin (4rs) for bourbon, and mgp for rye, it fits the bill.....and this particular barrel could be better then some true OBSO single barrels I have had.  This is an excellent bottle I am proud to have on the shelf.  I can find little fault except I don't like the origin mystery, and it being NAS.  Say what you are and wear it with pride, because this is damned good bourbon!"
