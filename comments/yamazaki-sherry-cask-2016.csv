4.0,"Had a dram of this last night at a local pub.  All of the tasting notes out there are pretty indicative of this Yamazaki. Deep and dark sherry with the accompanying chocolate and cherry Coke.  I detected no smoke, personally.  I also found a very slightly metallic element to the finish--not at all disconcerting, though.  At ~$300 I would probably buy this--and that is based purely on quality (not as an investment).  For $2000+...I'd wait for something with a little more character and a lot more soul."
null,So not worth $2000 a bottle then?
