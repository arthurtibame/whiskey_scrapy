5.0,"incredible, subtle, lingering ecstasy with a 167 ppm without any if the overwhelming nose like that of Laphroaig 10. Best dram to date."

4.25,"I'm a huge fan of Peated Whisky but I have to say that this one is something.

On the nose you can feel the salty peat but on the palate... nothing can come after this one.

The Whisky for the end of the night and for the start of the fight"
4.5,"The nose is a real cornucopia of smokey BBQ meats, plums, passion fruit, fortified red wine and a dash of brine. The palate carries on this adventure with peat accentuated by smoked meats, American BBQ, sweet port wine and bringing it to a close with a savoury, slightly bitter touch of chilli heat. The finish, long, dry and oily."
4.25,"Nose: Honey, peaty, sweet. As with many octomores I like the ""pureness"" of that peaty aroma
Palate: Still peaty and sweet, the sweetness rises when it gets to the second and third sip. Strong alcohol sensation."

4.25,"This honestly didn't taste as I expected it would - especially given the high peat ppm count. Really enjoyed this, and did purchase a bottle. Suspect it'll be for the collection, and not for sharing :)"

5.0,"Dark chocholate, some clove. Very much clove on next tasts."
4.75,"Nose: smoldering campfire, charred oak, sweet malt, dark fruits (plum, musty grapes) sprinkled in sugar, green olives, vegetal peat, cinnamon, sandalwood, latakia pipe tobacco

Palate: intense, sweet, rich and oily. Its a masterful roaring whirlpool of flavors. Smokehouse, bbq meats, tangy bbq sauce, umami, earthy red wine, dark chocolate, cinnamon and incense, shiitake mushrooms, barrel char, vanilla, slow building pepper spice. 

Finish: cured tobacco leaf, cigar smoke, leather, oyster sauce, smoked meats, tangy peat, creamy vanilla."
4.5,"Nose: That caramelized fruit syrup at the bottom of a fruitcake pan and then a leathery, deep, resinous smoke. There's just a bit of sharpness at the end, like a minty, burnt scent. Lots of toffee and dark caramel, and buttery smoke. There's also a hint of sweet raisins and figs in there, as well as light sultanas.

Palate: Definitely spicy at first and surprisingly thin. Almost like a super spicy rye at first - it's an explosion of spice.Then there's every type of smokiness you could imagine - burnt sugar, bonfire, barbeque, rubber, and almost burnt toast. Definitely buttered toast and smokey malt. Definitely some smoked bacon, that sweet fatty smoke.

Finish: Looking and dry. The smoke comes in everchanging waves brining in a smoked sweet almond note. There's a burnt sugar or molasses sweetness that hides under that smokey buttered toast. After a couple sips the oak shows up as a dense, waxy bitter wood note."

4.5,"Really powerful, rich, and complex. Incredibly peaty, certainly fulfills the Masterclass 8 series’ reputation as such. It’s also rather smoky, but not as much as I would have anticipated – less than a Lagavulin for instance. 

A little sweetness within the peat on the nose. In the taste, hidden amongst the peat and smoke is a bit of citrus, and you get a bit of milk chocolate in the back of your mouth, along with some oiliness. Finish is nice, the full flavor lingers with you for a while and you get a little more charcoal. 

Get as many 8-series as you can find!"
5.0,Only thing lacking is a stronger nose but the finish more than makes up for it

4.75,"Peat! Peat! Peat! When they call this a ‘Super Heavily Peated Whisky’ they are not kidding!  This is a wonderfully full bodied whisky.  Yes, it’s heavy on the peat, but this is a warm and rounded dram.  There are dark fruits, cinnamon and cloves, tobacco and a strange bitter sweetness that lingers for ages.  This is exactly my taste and close to a perfect dram for me.  

I need to ration my bottle - I could finish this in a single sitting and to hell with tomorrow!"
5.0,"Had a sample of this at a friend’s tonight. Great stuff surprisingly not so smoky.

Nose: Vanilla, Caramel, Flowers, Chocolate, Cherry, Apricot, Raisins, Sultanas, Pears, Peat, Citrus, Honey, Strawberry, Raspberry

Palate: Caramel, Chocolate, Sultanas, Cherries, Flowers, Pears, Honey, Mango

Finish: Smoke, Pepper, Tar, Chocolate, Vanilla, pineapple, mango, raspberry"

4.5,Peaty and rich as they have always been with a tinge of fruitiness to it. Keeps the octomore name going
