1.0,"Avoid! Most regretted whiskey purchase to-date at $100. Must let breath for at least an hour, to help somewhat. Overpowering dill in palate and finish - more than expected with this being a barrel proof MGP rye.  Something else very off in the palate/finish - possibly chemical or plastic. This is the first out of 12+ ryes I have ever strongly disliked. There is something about the bitter rye aftertaste, that gets me.  It tastes like all the worst parts of rye, and like there is no other complexity or flavor from anything else in the mash. 
    It seems like the funky finish (sour dill?) of the MGP ryes gets worse with age, as ithe same horrible aftertaste that is present in the Russell's Reserve Rye (6yr's) is worse in the Redemption 8yr. On the other hand, its not really present in the Bulleit Rye from MGP, which is aged at least 4 years (4-7 years, but more likely 4-5). 
      I greatly prefer High West Rendezvous Rye, and even possibly Double Rye when it comes to MGP ryes, considering the strange bitter/sour taste to this. I much prefer Willett 3 year rye and Colonel Taylor Rye to all those, as well as Knob Creek Rye and Baby Sazerac compared to this. Its certainly not worth the $100 paid for it. Still, it's something very different (beyond sweet ryes, Willet Rye, MGP rye, and High West blended rye), if that is what you're looking for. I do get gingerbread, though more dry than sweet."
