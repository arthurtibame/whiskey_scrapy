3.0,"""This bourbon is better than it has any right to be. Nice and smooth and you can't beat it for the price. Not my favorite bourbon but my wallet would argue that point."""

3.0,"Has a light sweet, creamy caramelly nose. More creamy banana on the palate initially which masks the young, green woodiness. Not very complex, but highly drinkable. Feels like a young Old Forester.

Months later I'm tasting this bottle again and here are my notes...

Sweet citrus on the nose, smooth corn whiskey mouth feel, and typical young barrel char on the palate with a hint of rye spice on the finish."

3.75,"Nose is sugar, spice, oak, pepper and licorice. Taste is smooth, peppery, oak and a long pepper finish. Medium mouthfeel."

2.25,"Vanilla and red berries on the nose with a hint of ethanol. On the palate it’s exceptionally light. Cornbread sweetness dominates with silky vanilla. 
One of the least complex whiskies I’ve had in a LONG time, but still well balanced."
2.0,Nothing special. A decent cheap bourbon.

3.5,"For those of you looking for a Kentucky Bourbon that is smooth on the swallow, and very good taste overall, on the lower end price, this one is it"
2.75,"Blah. Not much character. Not much burn. Thin, maybe a light smoke flavor. Very mellow. 

Good mixer, that’s about it.

“It ain’t much but it’ll get you drunk.”"
