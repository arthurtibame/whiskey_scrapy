Honey is immediate on the tongue followed quickly by sweet cream butter and brown bread which make up the primary body.

5.0,"The nose of the whiskey is dominated by the scent of oranges, just at the end there is a sweet note of honey and a faint whisp of smoke.  It is reminiscent of an Old Fashioned.

On the tongue the scotch is light with a sweet twist of orange followed by a light hint of peat.  There is a honeyed sweetness throughout.

By far and away my favorite scotch to date."

3.0,"Had this before but never formally reviewed. This is well known readily available scotch which can be a good thing. Poured neat, nose is ripe red apple, mild spice and barrel with barley malt. Standard speyside if you will. Pleasant and inoffensive. Palate is more of the same with fruity notes along with light malt, spice , and wood however a flash of gentle peat is there. Finish is drying malt and wood with lingering overtones of fruit and maybe a hint of smoke. This is just a nice plain jane single malt. Think of it as scotch training wheels till your ready to jump in the deep end. Seems to be a bit overpriced in some markets(I paid $41) but I have to say this stuff delivers a basic smooth scotch experience without any off notes or scary heavy peat for newcomers. If you have been around the block this will probably bore you but I still appreciate for what it offers........80/100.........Yes this is a long review for a relatively average scotch but I think its important to give some love to these gateway single malts that can lead down the path so to speak...... I do like the new packaging as well"

Not overly complex, nor does it have a long finish, but the orchard fruits and hints of vanilla come through on both the nose and the palate to provide an easy-sipping dram that’s just fine for most people who just want a Speyside Scotch in the $35 to $40 range. Buy it — you won’t be disappointed."

Palate: sweet in the beginning, a slight chili sensation, a good amount of dark chocolate

Finish: wood and ongoing dark chocolate, slightly dry

I must say I enjoyed this one. It definitely is an interesting dram that has to offer different chapters that stand out from each other. But it definitely doesn’t overwhelm with a lot of variety. This whisky offers just a few aspects but those it does deliver very well and convincing. The only real downside is that it feels too „rocky“ midway through the palate until the end of the finish - rocky in „hard, dry and rough“. I miss some roundness that would bring it together."

3.5,"Bought a little taster of this at the local liquor store just to try it.

Nose: it’s got a citrusy smell on the initial waft. Smells like a fizzy citrus, almost cleaning supply citrus. Raisins, nail polish, pears.

Taste: pear, light honey, slightly nutty beginning, does this weird thing where the moment you open up your mouth it goes peppery and slightly oaky, and gives you this slight smoke. It’s got a spicy cinnamon finish. 

Mouthfeel: watery, not a lot of body on this dram. Medium heat that stays for a cup of coffee and not much else, it shows up does it’s job and leaves quickly. The finish is dry like a high tannin wine. 

I really enjoyed this dram. It was exactly what I was expecting of this whiskey which isn’t a bad thing. I’d purchase this again."

Starts lightly in your tongue then shifts to a hot flavor, with little spices in there with a lovely long beautifil finish, with a little smoke present.

Remarks
This is a great beverage over all... I had difficulty deciphering all that there is with this single malt. There are tons of Flavors, Aromas and Complexity deciphering is difficult. It is Very Smooth, Wonderful. And most Enjoyable.
With the addition of water it brings fourth Apple and some peaty-ness.
BTW --- This is the WRONG Image for this bottle.

Be Kind, Be Generous, Be Real, Be Responsible!!!

3.5,"Once more into the sea of Scotch. Glenlivet 12-year-old is a solid welcome to scotch liquid that is found nearly everywhere that sells spirits and the quality is very consistent through the different bottles I have tried. ( Two small, a pint, and a 750ml.) This scotch grew on me as I drank it with my dad and later some friends. It still has the sharpness I associate with scotch but it is a manageable sharpness and with a touch of water or a few small cubes of ice it is actually quite pleasant to drink. The nose is light some fruit and some sweetness there is also some vanilla as well. The body is nice is a bit thin. It is warm and fairly smooth with vanilla and some wood. The finish is light and ends quickly with some wood and lingering sweetness. Overall, this is a nice entry-level scotch to try in my opinion and it will not break the bank. I have read that it has a ""generic Speyside"" profile and I am not sure what that means. This scotch makes a very nice High ball for a hot June day and for a scotch novice like myself its flavors do not overpower anything when I drink it. Glenmorangie 10yr is still the best tasting scotch I have had so far and a number of people have given me suggestions on the next ones to try and I am slowly getting to those. Lastly, on a personal note, I have read more harsh reviews about this scotch than any others to date and I am amazed by some of the language describing the liquid. I say drink what you want and what you can afford. Enjoy."

3.5,"Nose: Toffee and sea salt. Floral and citrusy. Delicately grassy, like beach grass. Some slight hints of peat. 

Palate: Toffee blending with vanilla. Lemon notes. Some honey as well. Almost tastes the way a hot whiskey does. Slightly malty as well. 

Finish: Medium-long. A little warm. Citrus lingering and keeping it lively. 

Overall Thoughts: Not bad at all! Definitely not one of the best but I can see why Glenlivet is wildly popular all over the world. It’s tasty and very easy to drink. However I wouldn’t say it’s a new favorite and I won’t be rushing out to buy a 750 ml bottle. This is something I’d recommend for someone looking to start trying Scotch. I’m more keen to try some of the older Glenlivet whiskies."
