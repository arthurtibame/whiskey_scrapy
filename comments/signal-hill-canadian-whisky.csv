3.0,"Nose (undiluted): a touch solventy at first, then rich caramel and cream aromas, reminiscent of Werther's Original hard candies, toasted oak, cola, and a bit of rye spice in the background, although there’s actually no rye grain here. It’s 95% corn and 5% barley.

Palate (undiluted): rich arrival, surprisingly mouth-coating for something bottled at 40% abv, floral honey, figs, orange zest, a touch of cinnamon.

Finish: medium length, more honey, rye spice, flat cola, ending on a slightly bitter (but still pleasing) orange zest note.

Adding water emphasizes the slight bitter note on the finish. But this is not an ""off"" vodka-esque note nor is it an acetone or spirity bitterness. It's akin to adding a dash of orange bitters to your whisky. I think this would make Signal Hill ideal in a Manhattan or even a whisky sour. The whisky is well-balanced and is perfect on its own as a digestif. 81/100"

3.75,This whisky reminds me of Newfoundlanders. Really sweet but doesn't mean they are weak!
3.5,"This is a typical Canadian whisky profile but done well. The nose is brown sugar, maple syrup and a bit of oak or light spice. Maybe a little bit of orange zest, but just faint. The palate is very sweet. Sugar sweetness. This reminds me of Pike Creek a lot which is rum finished. It does have some nice coating notes, which can come across like butter or cooking oil. A bit of pepper or spice comes through on the palate and early finish. The finish is more sugar sweetness and a bit of bitter oak. I think this would satisfy many Canadian whisky drinkers, but for me, it's just too sweet."
4.0,Roasted marshmallows?
2.5,"Very light nose had trouble smelling anything at first.

Sweet very sweet, like a spoonful of honey with a lingering spice.  Rice-pudding kinda taste and feel sweet spiced with dried fruit. And a coating mouth feel that is thick but not heavy"
