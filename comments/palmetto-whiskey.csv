3.0,Rye throughout. Slight burn.

2.0,You smell the rye come through strong in the nose with a hint of caramel. The rye then hits you strong on the pallet with a bitter pepper finish that leaves the tongue tingling with a little heat.

4.25,Good Whiskey for the price. A bit harsh straight but great on the rocks.

4.0,Very sweet with strong licorice flavor.   Resembles a very high rye bourbon mixed with a bit scotch.  Quite different.  A little harsh straight up.  On the rocks or with a splash of water is significantly better.

2.25,"I've been interested in this one for a while. Not available here in NC, but the distillery is very near where I lived in SC during the 90's. At that time, a distillery operating in SC would've been unheard of. Hell, you couldn't even buy beer or wine on Sunday! I was dropping off a chair to my daughter's apartment and saw she had a bottle she picked up on a recent trip to Charleston, SC. I poured myself a taste to try and...

Not bad. First few sips were Corn Sweetness, Black Pepper Spice, with a pleasant Vanilla/Oak coating after the finish. After a bit though, the lack of age became apparent. You get the hot ""White Dog"" burn/taste. The Oak became ""cardboard-ish"". My daughter said she and her boyfriend thought it was too strong, and I said ""No, it's not too strong, it's too young"". This has some good qualities but I think it needs more time in the barrel. This goes down like a ""shooter"", but it's priced like a ""sipper"". Not the worst craft whiskey I've had, but far from the best. It gets an extra quarter point for the awesome looking bottle."

2.75,"Bad. Hurt. Fire. Star anise, funky, beady but not good."
4.0,Strong vanilla throughout the taste. Slight mid-taste bite with a very smooth finish.

2.0,"On the nose some notes that I associate with young also dusty and sweet. Taste is inoffensive and has a cereal finish. The rye comes in about half way through, tingly and black pepper, and holds on into the finish. Adding a little water accented the cereal notes. I read some tasting notes and people mentioned pink bubble gum. After reading that I can pick it out, the cereal notes I get are reminiscent of the powder coated pink bubble gum stick from card parks. Ice made the proof and cereal more prominent and killed the other notes. 
Interesting and not like anything I remember having. I find myself trying to figure out the notes and what makes this so different from what I have had before as opposed to enjoying."
3.25,"Nose- definitely a hint of that sweet vinegar rye note 
Body- Sweet with baking spices. The heat hits you in the head rather than the chest.
Finish- sweet tea and mint

This is one of the better craft bourbons that I have had. Not bad at all."
