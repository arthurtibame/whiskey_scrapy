4.0,"My wife bought this for me at the Brussels airport.  I enjoy speyside scotch but wasn't sure what to expect from this bottling that apparently can only be found in airports.  This was my first Glenfiddich.  Appearance:  light golden yellow. Nose:  bread yeast, apples/pear, some citrus, honey.  Flavor:  sweet, honey, pipe tobacco, green apple. Finish: doesn't linger long, sweet. 84/100"

Taste: mild sherry, pear, vanilla, light bodied..


A so-so entry whisky.. But at least its smooth.."

Excellent sweet smell.
A good evening snifter.

3.0,"Hmmmm.   Got this as part of a 3 small bottle sampler set of the cask collection at Heathrow airport.  Light golden color and for me, nice scent of vanilla, honey, and flowers.  Very fragrant.  Agree with others that the linger doesn't last long - it's a nice scotch but a bit too sweet for me.   Can't wait to try the other two."
4.0,Very smooth with still the right smokey bite on the finish. Lots of honey and vanilla. The smokiness reminds me of flavored pipe tobacco. Very tasty.

3.0,"Baseline Speyside for beginners and ladies, but lets take it for a spin anyway. Sampled neat with 3 drops of Norwegian springwater to boost the flavour. Nose is mild and intriguing, cereal, mango and pears, raisins and a little smoke to finish off. This is desert and I wanna be all over this lady.
  Taste: Smooooth and sweet, first sip packs heat and the rest goes down gently. notable oak, pears, sherry and vanilla and some tangey peat that sadly takes the high road way too soon. I stand by my prediction, terrific for beginners, but I miss depth."

2.0,"Nose- there is a musty note on the nose of over ripe banana or damp wood which I do not particularly enjoy (your taste may differ) this musty note is similar to Glengoyne whisky.  The nose is very mild in this whisky, with very little alcohol punch.  After some time ripe fruit appears on the nose, dark red apple and pear to my sense of smell.
Taste- very, very smooth drinking with almost no alcohol burn or numbing after swishing.  Thin and smooth.  Not really intense enough for my preference.
Finish- very short and mild finish where the fruit and very mild notes of oak and pepper appear.  If you swish and drink strong warm apple juice the finish may be the same.  This whisky is very smooth and would be suited to someone new to scotch.
Overall- for me, this Scotch is very bland and under powered.  It's not a bad scotch, but it's not a great scotch either IMO.  If you are on the fence, the 1 L bottles found in duty free are not overly expensive.  Look around and you may find the sample pack of cask, reserve and vintage together to taste small before you buy big.  Not my favourite Glenfiddich.  I will not buy again."

1.0,"I buy glenfiddich select cask in malaysia, they sold the blue bottle version. And it too said select cask

Nosing. I cant smell anything but alcohol. I think this is the worst nosing i have ever had. Like there is nothing but alcohol inside. From the nosing I can already tell this whiskey is to get you drunk, not for gentleman-like drink. 

Palate. Believe me this ones is for the cocktail. Better served on the rocks, drink it with your mate, get drunk faster. No smoothness at all, oak floral. No smoke or peat"

3.5,Smells of apples. Slightly spicy and smooth.
4.0,"Very sweet and fruity on the nose reminds me of pear and ginger tart with a hint of vanilla. 

The sweetness continues on tasting with strong vanilla flavours and a richness from the wine casks. A silky smooth mouth feel with no burn whatsoever. 

A splash of water turns the nose to pear drops and turns the mouth feel much thicker and brings out honey notes in the taste."

Peaches, apricots honeycomb waxiness.  Not sugary sweet, but fruity sweet.  Thanks @Generously_Paul for the sample."

3.0,"Taking a quick break from the tour stops to review this travel retail exclusive from Glenfiddich. I found this at my favorite duty free shop and couldn’t pass it up. Two 1L bottles for only $65? Even if it’s bad that’s a price I’m willing to gamble on. Select Cask is another of the solera vat expressions coming out of Glenfiddich. This is a blending of ex bourbon, European oak and red wine casks. Bottled at 40% ABV and is chill filtered with colorant added making it a yellow gold. 

The nose opens with sweet cereal malt, lemon bars with powdered sugar, green grasses and sweet wine notes. Honey, golden raisins and oak that transitions from soft to sharp and back again. Salted chocolate, dates, apricots and tangerines. Very faint mint, vanilla and butter toffee. Grape jelly, apples and pears. Quite impressive for the price. 

The palate is sweet honey and malt, nutty like walnuts. There is something very familiar about this taste, almost like baklava. Very intriguing. Dates, apples with light cinnamon. A bit harsh at times with some green oak, showing its overall youth. 

Light bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium length, mostly oak tannins, slightly bitter and dry with orchard fruits. 

I have to say that for the price it doesn’t get much better. $65 for 2 liters is quite the deal for a scotch. The fact that it’s not half bad makes it even better. I’ve had much worse that have cost twice the price. Select Cask won’t be winning any awards, but I’m glad I bought it. If nothing else I can give away the second bottle as a gift. A solid 3.5 when you factor in the price. 
Cheers"

4.0,"Honey colored, light bodied, with an velvety mouthfeel.

Nose: a light breeze of ripe oranges, dates, and honey. Vanilla spread throughout. Faint nuttiness and a wisp of mint/menthol right at the end. Simple, sweet, and welcoming like a Summer breeze on a sunny day. 

Palate: starts with vanilla and honey. Joined by toffee and fruit in the middle. The fruit gets brighter and sweeter with time. Finish is medium and full of sweet fruits. The flavors of toffee and dates sit on the tongue a while after.

It may be a simple whisky, but it’s a delightfully simple whisky. The handful of flavors all combine perfectly and the lighter body makes it refreshing. I could see this as a great brunch scotch alongside toast and jam sitting outside on a sunny day. 

Quite lovely, I’m pleasantly surprised!"
null,"Color: Light honey

Nose: Vanilla and honey with ripe orange and dates with a faint nuttiness and mint. 

Palate: Light bodied with a velvety  mouthfeel. Vanilla and honey lead the way. With some toffee and fruits build to a bright finish.  Medium finish with lingering toffee and dates.

Over all, a light, sweet dram that would be perfect for a summer day or breakfast."

4.0,"Another Glenfiddich cask collection, using a Solera Vat system to make it. 

40%abv, with a deep gold color.

On the nose is a little dim, losing points there. A little perfumed, elegant, full of prunes, oranges, apples, milk chocolate and almonds.

On the palate is delicious, with caramel, prune peel, ashes and oak notes. It is medium bodied and the finish is long. This one makes your mouth dry, diferent than the reserve cask, which is mouth watering.

80 out of 100, i wouldn't buy this other ""cask collection"" one again, since it gets a little boring after a while, just as reserve cask."
3.25,"More sugary than the 12: caramel and molasses. A little salty as well. Puts me in the mind of a Dalmore but I don't know if that's just because of the antlers thing. The burn is also a bit more pronounced than I remember, but I know more now.

The peat and smoke are minimal, but that burn fills in the gaps. A mild ash but it still pales in comparison to the sweetness. Mild vanilla creme and honey in the finish. Pungent raisins and dates at the very end. 

This is not one of the harsher or peatier Scotches, it might be a good starting point for someone who is more attuned to more rounded, sugary, malty flavors, but with some heat nonetheless."
