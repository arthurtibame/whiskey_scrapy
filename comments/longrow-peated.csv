5.0,"Nose: Whoa! What?! What the hell is this??  Old metal toolbox? Sheeps wool? Oil?  Unlike any other whisky I've had.  Absolutely singular, but NOT for beginners.  Palate: Springbank funk + peat.  The peat is definitely of the rubbery sort like wet rainboots without much smoke influence like the Islayers.  Be advised that you may hate this palate, but I personally find it engaging, deep, complex, interesting, and singular whisky.  Finish: Yep.  Final Thoughts: Unlike anything else being made today.  Totally off-the-wall bizarre, but one of the most fun drams I've ever had.  Highly recommended."

I then added the merest suggestion of some water to it & by some strange alchemy it seemed thicker had more mouth feel,  it also invited the smokey elements to the front of the stage for their moment in the light."

4.0,"On nosing, one may be fooled into believing that this is a peated whisky as the smoke is not all that obvious, tucked away in the way back.  However, vanilla and caramel are obvious.  That all changes on the palate where the peat dominates, but not over-the-top.  As the palate swims past the peat/smoke, brown sugar, brine and white pepper flavors blend and in balance  amongst themselves.  The palate is left with the spice and menthol  and that ocean-brininess.  This was magnificently paired with Truffled mushroom broth, pancetta, baby kale, Dijon matzoball, mimolette that absolutely drew out the flavors and aromas.  [87/100][Tasted: 1/31/16 @ Eat Mosaic]"

4.0,"This is remarkable. At first I didn't know what to expect other than thinking this would be another super peaty whisky. Boy was I wrong. The nose is engaging. Smokey peat with that distillery Springbank funk and a slight sweetness. The taste was incredible a sweetness hits the taste buds then that smoke build slowly and come forward. The mouth deal is full but it doesn't have that alcohol burn you would think you would get from a NAS whisky. This is super delicious. the finish again has that smoke and the sweetness dissipates slowly leaving a smooth and oily buttery finish. Super good! Well done Springbank. Definitely a hidden Jem. The smoke is not what you would think when it says ""heavily prayed"". Definitely one to stock up on"

3.5,"Here comes another peated Single Malt that isn't from Islay: Longrow Peated (NAS) from Springbank distillery. The aroma starts out promising with intense honey-vanilla sweetness, vegetal peatiness and unmistakably coastal/briny notes. On the palate, the mouth-warming, dry and fairly spirit-driven arrival is followed by bitter lemons, white pepper and salty peat smoke. Its youthfulness shows in the earthy, mineral but surprisingly short finish that is not very substantial. To sum up, it's a fresh and appealing malt which doesn’t have the 'oomph' of Islay.

RATING: 3.4/5.0 stars ≙ 82 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE [-]"
4.0,"Drinking neat: This whiskey gives me flashbacks of my childhood going to Santa Cruz each summer. The ocean is ever present with a solid frosted white cake backbone. Floral, lemon meringue, honeydew melon make their presence known like the other two Springbank variants I've tried (Springbank 10 & Hazelburn 12) plus earth and musky plant. There's some pear as well with hints of banana and vanilla custard. The mouthfeel is almost milky and as easy drinking as Springbank 10. Overall Longrow is my favorite of the 3 I have tried and would say not only is it worth a try, but worth a buy as well."

5.0,"Finally getting a pour of this; long been at the top of my list. The nose's first impression is of fresh pineapple, with honeysuckle, a seaside warehouse, and hints of leather being discerned afterward. My wife, whose birthday is the occasion of this tasting, smells the bacon-wrapped dates we had at a tapas restaurant a week ago. On the palate as in the bouquet, the to-die-for Springbank trademark of savory sweetness is evident. Further, I can't understand how this can be a NAS whisky, as it is wise beyond its years. Sweet lemon peel, smoked trout, peppered honey, rich earthiness, and a gradually increasing peat influence (rubbery and oily) mark the palate as I confirm to myself that Springbank is my favorite distillery thus far. This dram finishes deep, warming the throat without being overly wild, and the burn is consistent. Tarragon, peat smoke, and honeysuckle stay for the aftertaste. This will be my next bottle of whisky."

4.0,"Thank you to Davie Warner for this sample (and double thanks for pointing out to me I initially posted it to the wrong bottle page)! Longrow's most intriguing feature is a unique flavor of peat on the nose, like a well-oiled leather. It's unlike any other scotch I've ever had. As the smoke clears, the scotch falls squarely within the Ardbeg-Kilchoman Machir Bay spectrum of citrus-flavored peated scotches. This is a dead ringer for Machir Bay to me, where a bit of sherry finishing mellows out the peat. The finish is not quite like either of those two Islay scotches, but it's quite ashy and grassy, like throwing fresh hay on a fire pit. Trying more and more of these quality no age statement scotches makes me appreciate how important it is to try a scotch and judge it on its own merits."

4.0,"A sight for sore eyes. Non chill-filtered, natural color and 46% ABV. The only thing I could ask for is an age statement, but it's the least important omission. 

Pale gold and even slightly green in appearance, forms a beautiful Scotch mist with added water. 

Nose is of an older, almost forgotten world: powerful woody peat-smoke, fragrant apples and citrus, some bracing salt air and hints of earthy cedar and bergamot. 

Palate is simple but rich, zesty and slowly bittering.

Finish starts with a spicy wash of bitter ginger before a smoother wake of earthy mushroom.

I've had this bottle lurking in the back of my reserve for over 3 years, so glad I finally resolved to break it's seal this season. Springbank distillery has earned my attention! 

Dry glass: smoked malt cocoa."

3.5,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #11

Nose: Gentle smoke, fruity, vegetal, briny, vanilla, caramel.

Palate: Rich and oily, peaty, subtle smoke, spicy (ginger), a slight alcohol bite that is balanced by creaminess.

Finish: Long, peaty and fading out sweet.

Unlike some smoky whiskies, the addition of a dash of water does not develop waxy flavours. It mutes the nose but does not change the overall character. On the palate the effect is stronger, bringing out both sweetness and more smoke whilst taming the alcohol burn.

Adding water and allowing it to sit for 10 minutes is highly beneficial, developing more depth and roundness. Nice whisky that combines the characters of Campbeltown and Islay but has a ""restrained peat"" character similar to that of Benromach.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

Yeah. It’s young. Maybe 7-8 years. Too young. It’s got promise, but not enough character. Light vanilla, vegetal and biscuity. Moderate peat. Strange that this is a Springbank that is completely double distilled, but this one ends up reminding me of a peated Irish, like Connamera. Not my thing. 

It’s ~65 USD for the bottle here. Gonna skip.

Adding water mutes the nose but does not change the overall character very much, however it does bring out more sweetness and smoke whilst taming the alcohol burn. I’d recommend just a couple of drops.
        
My first taste of this whisky was in September 2017, from a 50ml sampler bought at the distillery. A couple of weeks ago I picked up a 70cl bottle and I’ve had several tastes now. The tasting notes above are a cut-and-paste from my first tasting last year, as I didn’t see any reason to revise anything … except the score which I’m now bumping up to 4 stars.
        
Since peat became the new fashion a couple of decades ago a lot of distilleries that had never previously produced smoky whisky have started crafting such expressions. These have varied in quality but for the most part my feeling is that heavily smoky whisky is best left to the experts on the islands.
        
 However, I make an exception for two distilleries that have created something different to the intense bracken-peat of Islay, the maritime peat of Skye, and the soft heather-peat of Orkney.  These are Benromach, who have mastered a very particular dry-fragrant bonfire/woodsmoke, and Springbank, who created a multi-faceted, soft smoky/vegetal/maritime/mineral character by greatly increasing the duration of smoke contact during kilning and doing a double distillation instead of their usual 2.5 regime.
        
Springbank’s Longrow expressions are too subtle and characterful to be dismissed as wannabee Islays.  In fact for me they have more in common with Talisker than anything from Islay, and I like them as an alternative smoky profile that is worthy of exploration.  This NAS expression is very good and a worthy introduction to double distilled Springbank spirit.

3.0,"So, I rifled through my liquor cabinet a couple of weeks ago and spotted this Longrow Peated that I purchased almost 2 years ago and decided this one needs to move along (aka get drank).  For those that don’t know, Longrow is Springbank’s heavily-peated whisky line.  They make several age statement bottles, but this one is the NAS version.  Basically, Springbank has allocated 100 casks per year, since 1973, for the Longrow line.  Even though there isn’t an age statement on this bottling it is non-chill filtered and natural in color.  It’s a pale gold in the Glencairn and forms heavy droplets and undefined legs.  I paid around $55 for this bottle back in 2016.  Prices have remained pretty steady for this one, too.

The nose is surprisingly more salty than I expected.  Very Talisker-esque.  There’s some vegetal notes and lots of earthy peat.  A quick hit of sweet vanilla mingles in nicely but the campfire smoke is kept in check.  The palate brings fresh oak and vanilla to the front, with smoke and salted fish rolling around the tongue.  The youthful spirit is unexpectedly harsh, especially being Springbank, and kind of limits me from detecting much depth.  The finish is medium length, salty and very dry.  This one is all wood, earthy peat and smoke, which is what they’re going for I suppose.  This stuff needs to spend some quality time in a great finishing cask IMO.  As it is, it’s a bit too harsh to be thoroughly enjoyed.  At 46% ABV I don’t think watering it down will help much- it just needs some older juice blended in.

Overall, it’s decent and I guess a respectable preview of what Springbank’s heavily peated whisky is all about, I just think the islands and Islay do it so much better that this style should be left to those guys.  3 stars, tops.  Cheers."

As the embers are moved, a lot of lemon, herbaceous hints, pears, honey, vanilla, a pinch of salinity are spread. Very warm and enveloping, almost a peat herbal tea to sip in winter. Drinking does not vary over time, but remains largely (and dangerously!) pleasant.
