2.75,"Second Total Wine scotch I purchased. Not much info anywhere on this one so going in blind. Its peated and has 8yr age statement so how bad can it be? Poured neat, nose has dusty cardboard, bread dough and mild smoky honey with malt. Palate begins with more smoky dusty honey malt but adds a touch of fruit and a yeasty note. It would be quite good but it lacks any power or depth so the thin taste just flutters around and your left wanting more. Couple drops of water opens it up a bit. Finish is ok with lingering smoke, black pepper ,gentle doughy malt and drying charred wood. I find peated scotches always finish well as the smoke notes carry for a while. This is a decent smoky scotch. Nothing great, but for newbies this is a good intro. Peatheads should open the wallet and go up the food chain to the big guys for their smoke fix. Since Im already there I will not repurchase but this is not bad..............78/100"
