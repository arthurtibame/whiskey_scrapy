5.0,"Tasted with Laura Hay during presentation. Did not write notes so this is based on simple memory, 
This was incredibly smooth but also with great complexity with sweet, smokey subtle fruit and nut flavours. The finish was also very smooth, belying it's alcohol content, which was hardly noticeable due to the incredible balance displayed in the whiskey. Super stuff, but also on a completely different profile to the 21yo"

5.0,"Tasted 10/15/2014 : I was looking forward to tasting this one, having the opportunity.  I have always been partial to Glenlivet.  This dram starts off with a banana and butterscotch sweet nose.  On the palate, this is light, creamy, full and sweet.  A short, sweet, full finish, which I wish was longer because I found this to be a wonderfully, enjoyable scotch."

Very nice whiskey, a bit pricey but something that you need to try at least once."

4.0,"it doesn't even need to sit in your mouth, you can just drink it, amazing scent like the Glenlivet 15 and the Glenlivet 21.  Oh man."
5.0,"If you are fortunate enough to be able to find this jem, ensure you surround yourself with your closest friends who appreciate whiskey. 

Nose: note of ooey gooey marichino cherry Christmas cake. 

Pallet: brilliant, smooth. Warm and welcoming.  Very complex and full body. 

Finish: It comes quickly. And the warmth lasts.

Over time, the whisky morphs into a complex bouquet of vanilla, crime brule and a hint of plum surprises the senses. To achieve this level of pleasure, must sit in the tulip whisky glass neat for minimum of 20 minutes."

4.5,"Nose - Spicy vanilla caramel, dark apple/pear juice, dark honey, very faint dark chocolate mint?

Taste - Hint of smoky toasted oak, dark chocolate, smoked sea salt on a roaster pear filled dark chocolate candy, golden raisins, toasted spices, hint of tobacco & leather, dark honey, dark caramel, lightly oaky dryness

Finish - Lingering toasted spice, wisp of leather/dark chocolate richness, caramel/toffee, mocha

Score - 93/100

Final Thoughts - So this is what a nicely aged Glenlivet should be. Nice ""dark"" nose, very complex taste & finish. This gives me visions of a dark mahogany library with a gentle wood fire going and lots of old books and well oiled leather furniture. Nice complex taste and nice ""bite"" given the lower proof. Very nice from start to finish with no off-putting notes to be seen. You can just tell that this has spent many years aging in oak due to the mouthfeel alone and although I don't think Glenlivet uses any peated malt, there's this interesting light smoky quality to this that makes it very interesting.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes if I could find it ~$250"

5.0,"Unreal. Legit the heaviest dram I’ve ever felt on the palate. This thing swishes in your mouth with such a smoothness that is hard to describe. Sherry is dominate with cooked fruits and some fresh oakiness. Sugary cherries are there as well. Finish is very robust and as smooth as can be. Insane, just insane. The 18 is beyond great but this is wildly magical. 100/100"
4.0,"A bit briny, slightly smoky. Blooms through the nose, quite pleasant. Not sweet. So smooth. Came in a lovely box"

4.75,"This is an odd Scotch which almost tastes like a very good cognac (no complaints here) . It's wonderfully done and with beautiful packaging. I scored a bottle for $300 out the door so I had to get it, and luckily I did. Delicious if you love juicer scotchs, if not then it might not be for you."
