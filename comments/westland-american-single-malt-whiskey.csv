1.0,"I purchased this thinking it was the Sherry Wood product. When reviewing  the DD site graph it seemed to align with MacCallan 12. Boy was I off. This American Single Malt is no bueno. I can't quite put my finger on it, and so I brought it into the office for others to try and tell me how bad my taste buds were, but they had similar looks on their faces. It's either a medicinal run or plastic flavor running all the way through. Weird."

Not bad but not worth the $70 price tag in my opinion.  It is interesting and could be fun at a whisky tasting, just not something I'd buy again."

4.0,"On a recent business trip to India, I had taken a few days off to visit in-laws in Mumbai.  I had bought this for my brother-in-law , as something unique and not available outside the US (especially South Asia).   It's young, maybe 3-4 yrs  old, but hides its age extremely well.  At the onset, you can smell chocolate, coffee and cinnamon.   almost like Mexican cocoa.  The taste is a bit oaky, with a heaping dose of baked apples and cinnamon, followed by ginger and chocolate.  You get more coffee...espresso specifically.   It's definitely Oak driven, wood plays the integral role here.  Really well made, and in my humble opinion...better than most other new upstarts (with the notable exception of Kilchoman).  Also....on a side note---remy martin is buying this distillery.  So...two Americans now bought (High West and now this)."

4.0,"Westland is a lauded single malt made in Washington state and is one of the leading lights of the American single malt movement.  I tend to be quite skeptical of these young, new whiskies, which often haven't had the luxury of aging long enough to develop rich flavors but then get graded on a curve by most reviewers.  That being said, this is very promising.  After a waft of furniture polish clears out and this dram opens up, apple, sherry, and malt produce a enticing, albeit uncomplicated, nose.  Its characteristic flavors are apple and malt, with a little bit of rising heat after a few seconds in the mouth, which is where its youth (two years in the barrel) betrays itself.  The finish is where this shines, starting with a brief, young oak note before transitioning to a deep, cherry chocolate cola note.  It's one of the best finishes I've had in a whiskey aged 10 years or less, better than many scotches.  I'm shocked this is aged in new charred oak barrels, with no sherry involvement.  I also love the 46% ABV and dark, rich, caramel color.  It's simple, but I'd recommend it, and can only imagine it's going to get better with age.  The Kilchoman of the Pacific Northwest."

2.0,"Not quite Scotch, not quite bourbon, yet still possessing notes of each. On second tasting (first tasting ruined by caramel ice cream just prior to tasting) I definitely got a rich sweetness mixed with a woody, pine-tree-like taste. Chocolate, caramel, pepper and definite hints of tobacco and wood, this is not a top-shelf whiskey for me but still a decent treat."

Finish - Lingering Cracker Jack / caramel corn, cocoa nibs, latte foam, sweet roasted nuts.
Score - 88/100
Final Thoughts - I like what Westland is doing with their multi-malt mashbill. I think their pale chocolate malt and brown malt add this very nice nuttiness that helps hide this whiskey's youth very well. Their standard offering is very tasty on its own given its youth and I can only imagine what some additional time in barrels will do to mellow out this malt and smooth out the rough edges."

After smelling and handling the barley used, tasting the wash from the tank and nosing the raw spirit before barreling, this was easy to fall in love with! One of my favorites. The ""single barrel"" mini bottle (at barrel strength, straight from the barrel) was bottled by Laura and I, and only to be opened on a special occasion of her choosing in the future!"

4.0,"With the holiday season (mostly) a wrap, a wee dram to fortify oneself against the winter chill is in order while I get in the seed order for this year's garden. My wife told me to ""go buy some whiskey that you'll like"" as part of my Christmas present, so...I took her up on that. Granted, buying a bottle of something I've haven't tasted before is a bit of a gamble, but this one paid off nicely, and I've no reason to doubt the judgment of the golden palated folks here who've sung the praises of Westland.

The biggest note for me here is chocolate, and in a few different forms...at various moments in time, I get baking chocolate, spiced Mexican dark chocolate, hot cocoa, and fudge. While the chocolate notes are the most obvious, there are some notes of espresso, dried fig, vanilla, and coconut. I even get the faintest hint of charred wood in the background, almost like someone in the neighborhood's just gotten a charcoal grill started. The mouthfeel is deliciously coating, but not heavy.

My sole complaint is that there's a definite youthfulness here...it's a younger distillery, so this isn't a huge shocker, but I did need to let the dram sit for a bit to open up since there was a definite ethanol heat on initial pouring. I'd have loved this bottle at, say, $10 less, but I still feel like I got what I paid for at about $60. Still, if this is what their entry level whiskey is like, I can't wait to get my hands on some of their other output."

2.75,"At the picturesque Biltmore Estate sitting by a fireplace, not a much better setting for a nice dram. Westland is part of my list of American Single Malts and I have heard nothing but good things. 
The one thing I am learning about American single malts is just how different and unique they all are. There really is no overriding common flavor profile. 
This one is amongst the most unique. The overriding note is peanut brittle and nut butter. It's really dominant. The body is pretty viscous and with a medium peanut and oak driven finish. 
Unique. Worth a pour, sure. Worth a bottle? Not for me."

Its well rounded and very flavorful. On the finish I am once again exposed to that coffee note so many find and love Westland for. It makes the finish worth savoring.  This has made me want to fall in love with Westland and has earned it a permanent spot in my permanent collection."

The nose is nothing too radical. Some spice with vanilla, maple from the new char oak barrel. The taste was the most interesting part. This has a subtle coffee cream flavor that coats the mouth. It’s silky, and the taste stays with you for some time. The finish changes from coffee to a nutty flavor that I really enjoyed. 

Honestly this has become one of my favorite American single malts. It sits proudly next to my bottle of Balcones “1” Texas single malt which I love. Is it worth the retail price of $70? Meh... but it was definitely worth the $49 I paid today!"

I thought I'd really like to try something like that (done better than the 2nd Edition Glenmorangie Signet I had) and then promptly forgot about it. Next day having randomly selected a dram I tasted it and thought eh this is interesting, read the bio and low and behold a mixture of different malts and  belgian yeast. You really do get the cocoa, chocolate coming through from the dark malts and that's after drinking a cocoa milk stout beer (and Bunnahabhain 18 in between). Would have loved to pair the beer with this whiskey. It's a young whiskey with a slightly thin body and aftertaste but that's to be expected.. you don't want the cask to overpower the spirit.

4.0,"Perusing the ABC Store aisles in a larger neighboring county, I came across this one on sale for $38. I wondered why I had never given this $40'ish dollar single malt a try (NC sale items are usually only a couple dollars off), so I picked one up. It was only after I got home, sampled and liked it, that I decided to look up the regular price. That's when I realized why I had never given this one a second glance. It's regular price is $70! NC must be closing this one out...Now on to my tasting notes.
NOSE: Unique. Leather, Unlit Cigar, Oak, Toffee, Tea, Hay, maybe a hint of Orange Peel, all wrapped in a light floral note.
NEAT: Enters slightly Bitter and Hoppy, like a Stout Beer. Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans, Burnt Popcorn, Unsweetened Dark Chocolate, and Unlit Cigar. Finishes with a medium length light tingle. The palate is coated with a touch of sweetness that lingers on the palate along with a smoky/ashy almost peaty flavor.
SPLASH: Ups the Floral Note on the nose while adding tea to the palate. Also amplifies the lingering Ashy Note. 
VERDICT: Different and Delicious. Before I became a seasoned whiskey drinker I knew what Bourbon and Jack and Crown tasted like just from casual drinking. This is what I imagined scotch tasting like. I'm not sure that I'd consider this a great $70 whiskey, but I damn sure consider it a great $40 whiskey. So much so that I went back and blew my next two months liquor budget on 5 more bottles. If you are in NC, seek this one out at the close out price of $38, and thank me later."
3.75,"Not a scotch/single malt fan, but I have to say I was impressed by this. Nose and Palate of roasted coffee beans covered in dark chocolate. The roasted note stays with you on the finish, which was lasting enough to my liking. Will definitely purchase a bottle!"
3.75,"Deep, dark, rich, oily and a bit floral. Lots of dark chocolate and coffee notes, a bit of smoke,  black roasted sugar. What you get on the nose you will get on the palate. Finish is a nice bitter dark chocolate. A solid American single malt whiskey. I would love to try this at a higher proof. 3.8 or 3.9 would be a fare rating."
