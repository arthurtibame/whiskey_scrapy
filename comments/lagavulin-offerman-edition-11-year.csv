4.25,"Light peat, fruitier than I expected. A good dram with a great back story! Worth the $65 I paid for it."
5.0,Just a touch spicier than the 16. A cozy but not overwhelming peat.
5.0,"Mid range on peat. More fruit than classic 16, a fantastic dram overall."
4.0,"Was a bit skeptical when I heard they were doing a Offerman Edition. Especially when I was not a huge fan of the 9 year game of thrones edition. But I was pleasantly Proven wrong. The 11 year is delicious and another unforgettable expression from Lagavulin. 

Nose: Peat, smoke, sweet cigar ash. Baked cinnamon apples, sweet pears, and nutmeg. 

Taste: mild peat and smokiness, vanilla, caramel, and candied cherries. Mid pallet is wonderfully malty with a long lingering finish of barrel mustiness, and fruits including apricots, apples, and maybe a slight cranberry? (That could be all in my head)"

4.0,"Color is a dark amber. Nose initially consists of leather and peat. Further nosing reveals a distant spiciness. The first sip is earthy, with a light smoky/peaty flavor, with a mild underlying sweetness. Mouthfeel is light, but not in a bad way. Additional sips reveal subtle dried fruit and the distant spice from the nose. Notes of tobacco (cigar smoke?) get revealed later in the glass. The finish is moderate in length, consisting of lingering earthy peat, mild spice, and a mild nuttiness. Not much Scotch experience to compare to, but overall this is excellent."

4.5,"Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has some nice fruit notes, mainly apricot and pear, with spice and smoke coming though at the back.  Taste has oak and peat, spice and smoke, green apple, heather.  Nice long peaty finish.  

I am big fan of both Nick Offerman and Lagavulin, and  - thus acknowledging the real possibility of a subconscious bias - I am a really big fan of this whisky.  More nuanced than the 16, but still retains that smoky peat awesomeness I expect from this distillery.  Highly recommend.  11/19/19"
4.25,"Peaty aroma with a hint that reminds me of tequilla, less peaty than the 16, very sweet also.  Taste is spicy all along the way except the swallow.  Very woody aftertaste and then a final mouthfeel of caramel that is long lasting."
4.25,Nice and smoky.
4.5,Sweetness up front. Balanced.  Enjoying it.  Like it better than the 12 year.  Will buy another when available.

4.5,"Taste of smoked brisket, brine and tobacco.
Less oily than it's 16 year counterpart, definitely feels younger. Much stronger barrel notes than the 8 but not as strong as the 16. 

I wish this wasn't $5 more than the 16 but it is limited edition after all"
4.25,Aromas of dark honey and a smoky chili powder make this Lagavulin more broody than its older siblings. Sweet mesquite smoke tricks you into lowering your guard before a more vibrant peppery spice fills the mouth. You’re left to savor a peppery finish with a dusting of dark chocolate. It’s perhaps a little watery and lacking in mouthfeel - I’d love to try it at cask strength - but it’s nevertheless an enjoyable variation on the rest of the family and a redemption after the disappointing 10 year.

4.5,"Nose: honey, savory smoke
Taste: bready, the smoke is there but not right at the forefront, pepper, can’t place the sweetness - maybe apricot or just a light honey, alcohol tingles the tongue more than I remember from the 16
Finish: minty fresh feeling, the peppery smoke stays with you
After reading reviews: my experience was pretty consistent with the reviews I found - lots of mentions of honey, apricot (pear to many), pepper, less smoke but more alcohol.  Others find it fruitier than I’m getting, and several focused on the oakiness from the barrel which isn’t jumping out at me.  Overall, it’s really nice with no dominating note but a nice combination of several."

3.25,"Noticed the higher proof right away. You can also tell that it's a tad younger, but overall it's pretty standard Lagavulin. If you like  Lagavulin 16 you'll like this. If you like  Lagavulin 16 and this is more expensive, buy  Lagavulin 16."

4.75,"On the nose, there are these ""musty"" fruits.  Imagine fruits sitting in a wicker basket in a damp cellar.  It reminds me a little of the Lagavulin 9 (Game of Thrones), but this has more of a mature quality.  It has a lot of fruit notes that a lot of Speyside whiskies have (stone fruits with hints of citrus) which I am more than pleased with.  The peat is relatively smooth.  The thing I am learning from having the Lagavulin 8, 9, 11, 12, & 16 is that the age increases, the smoke and fruit become more and more integrated.  It's like a good marriage.  At the onset, the couple are essentially two people with similar goals and personalities.  As they age they become more of a unit and each of their personalities becomes softer in order to complement the other's.  This is how the smoke and fruit work in Lagavulin.  As they age, they become less intense, but more integrated at the same time.  This produces a stronger and tastier unit.  I highly recommend this.  Compared to the 12, it's more subdued (partly due to ABV) and the musty smoke is more pronounce.  The 12 is more fruity, but both are delicious."
4.0,"Not your typical Lagavulin, it’s a bit of a twist on what I’m used to. The Aroma doesn’t have the smoked meat profile and is instead carries a fruitier and sweeter nature; Palate is a tad briny but continues the fruity theme; Finish hits like a smoked dessert."
4.0,"Nose: Bacon bits, peat smoke, honey, grilled citrus, sourdough bread
Palate: Rich.  Salted caramel, tobacco, dark chocolate.  Medicinal finish"

4.25,"N - brine, slightly meaty, dark cherry, a bit flowery/potpourri

T - earthy peat, dried fruits either raisins or apricot, leather, buttery malt. with water some butterscotch

F - classic Lagavulin smoke but with less mint and more pepper. A bit of chocolate lingers.

It could be in my head but does taste a little younger from what I recall the 16 tasting like. Also a bit less briskety. Adding a small drop of water turned up the smoke and pepper which wasn’t a bad thing.  Overall line from what I’d expect with Lagavulin and the added effect of having Nick Offerman’s face stare back at you is a fun perk."

4.5,"Ron Swanson's signature dram. A winner even before opening the bottle. The most pleasant nose - strong aromas of green apple, toffee-apple-esque, with a hint of cinnamon/spice. The subtlety of the quintessential Islay smoke starts here also. On the palate, oak-wood peat intensifies but is bridled and harnessed by the rather sweet strawberry-blueberry notes. A rather short finish more fruity than your usual Lagavulin, but leaves that trademark dry leathery feel in the mouth. The best part (bar the nose) is despite the seemingly fleeting finish, a rather drawn out peaty sensation that lingers and accumulates. A brilliant dram all round."

4.5,"Reminiscent of the annual 12 year old special release, however obviously lacking the punch in the face of that cask strength bottling and, in turn, the power of the peat and smoke isn't as strong. That being said, as many have noted, the fruit notes are more prevalent here. If you've had one of the NAS Jazz Fest bottlings from the past few years, you'll know what I mean. It's a balance that the best Lagavulin releases achieve. The 46% compliments all of the proceedings very well – makes you wish they'd up the % on the 16, though that is the definition of a ""classic malt,"" marketing aside. In any case, this is an excellent whisky, especially given the original retail price (if you can find it for that, still). Highly recommend for Laga fans and peats fans, alike."

4.75,"Ah, Lagavulin. You never let me down. 16, 8, DE, 12 all knock it out of the park. Gimmicky GOT 9-year old?  No gimmicks there. Damn fine stuff. At this point, even though I'm inherently distrustful of the celebrity-branded whiskies, I've actually got quite a bit of faith in this one to deliver.

Nose: Heavy campfire smoke and peat, light brine and sea salt. Caramel, vanilla, custard, butterscotch, gala apple. Banana, walnut, and toffee. Cinnamon, black pepper, and oak spice. Some lemon and grapefruit citrus notes. A bit of smoked meat. Nice blue raspberry. Good start.

Palate: Heavy campfire and peat now accompanied by some iodine and ash. Smoked meat/brisket is written all over this one. Sea salt and brine are now more prominent. Still getting the caramel, vanilla, and gala apple, as well as the cinnamon, black pepper, and oak. Spicy salsa as well. Roasted almond. There's also dark chocolate. Plenty of spice and sweetness, smoke and brine, but above all else, the smoked meat notes stand out. Very nice, and notably darker and heavier than the 8 and 9, and even the 12.

Finish: Mint chocolate, dark chocolate, and vanilla cream. Hits like a bite of ice cream cake. The blue raspberry from the nose reappears. If the palate is the main course, the finish is dessert. Of course, there's still some of that sea salt, smoke, cinnamon, black pepper, chili, and oak. With some brisket. It's Lagavulin after all, and as is customary, those are the last notes detectable before this long finish concludes.

Lagavulin, Ron Swanson, you did not let me down. Unique enough to be earn a spot in the Lag lineup. But it embodies the spirit and the quality that one expects of the vaunted Lagavulin name. It tastes much older than the 8 and 9. Even older than the 12-year bottlings I've had. Don't get me wrong; this one couldn't contend with the 12 line by any means. But the oak presence is noticeably more present.

I'd put this on par with the younger bottlings of Lag. I prefer the 16, DE, and far and away, the 12. But I don't think I've ever given a rating less than a 4.5 to Lag expression. And it certainly contends with the 8 and 9, both of which I really like.

At $65, I feel I got my money's worth. No complaints here; this is a fine offering and a vindicator of the celebrity-branding movement in my eyes. Ultimately, Lagavulin is Lagavulin. Great stuff. 4.75/5."

4.0,"Appearance: A honey gold color lights up this special scotch, with thick watery legs teasing one into a sip.

Nose: The nose could summarize Nick Offerman himself, I’m sure. There is a tough rugged side boasting delectable Lagavulin peat, and meat like tender BBQ. But there is also a hidden softer side with notes of honey and flowers, incense smoke, red apple and cherry.

Taste: The palate isn’t at all overwhelming and is delicious with notes of salty peat, BBQ burnt ends, and dark chocolate.

Finish: The finish is briney and peaty and dry.

Thoughts: Now this is Lagavulin! I would love nothing more than to drink this scotch with Ron Swanson and discuss life and whiskey! It’s a delicious sipper, with admittedly a bit less flavor than I was expecting, but still fantastic. I am glad I tried it and definitely recommend it! Lagavulin, well done, friends! Sláinte!"

4.5,"A new Lagavulin is always wonderful news. But this time they got into the pop culture by releasing this ""Offerman"" edition, in honor of Nick Offerman a tv series famous character who is widely known for drinking Lagavulin. 

Lagavulin even made a series of ""Offerman's documentaries"" that you can find in youtube. 

But the real conclusion that this whisky left me is that this is the second recognizable whisky in the world. What do i mean by this? Well, i have often said that we, whisky enthusiasts, are not as wine master sommeliers, that can recognize a wine and its vintage year with a blindfold; but if you have 10 whiskies in a table and one of them is a Macallan, you probably wouldn't guess which expression it is, but you would definitively recognize the macallan, because Macallan always smell like a Macallan. 

That has happen to me with Lagavulin. 

Lagavulin's prefumed peat aroma is recognizable easily. It is different from the ""tar"" of Ardbeg, the ""Fresh can of tennis balls"" from Laphroaig, the heather from Highland Park and the toffee/salt from Talisker. Therefore, you can guess that a whisky is a lagavulin by only perceive its aroma. 

Having said that; lets get into business. 

Bottled at 46%abv, golden color. 

The Nose is perfection. Complexity. It starts with a Heathery peat. Then i got Fire; actual fire, this is the first time i got this in a whisky.
Fondant; That lagavulin tar/ peat.
There is a sweetness to it

After the first sip, it becomes meringue, AMAZING. In has become sugary in a beatitul way. The vanilla cake note is so accurate and clean. Lemon pie. 

But the palate fails to deliver, without been bad. Sour prunes, a little watery (strange for 46%abv), vanilla and some saltiness. 

Aftertaste is great. Amazing and mild,
Not overly peated but the aftertaste sensation of peat and ginger is beautiful. Mild ¿¿gunpowder??; Grassy peat, hay.

Overall, Lagavulin did a great job here. Most new markets will buy this just because the ""Offerman"" marketing strategy, and then, they will be hooked. Great dram, 92 over 100. Sláinte!"

It was richer in the style of the 16 with more oomph. This profile is a sharper more acidic peat which I'm not a huge fan of. I had another side taste of the Ardbeg Galileo and my preference also lies there. Decent drop but not one for me.

Right up there in that street cred, like having an Oscar sitting on your mantle.  But, I find I can’t seem to link the spirit with the marketed personality of the celebrity.  So, case and point:  I found Wild Turkey Longbranch smooth and silky.  I don’t associate smooth and silky with its celebrity sponsor, Matthew Mcaunaugey.  (Sp?).  But this one...spot on with Nick Offerman.  My impression of Mr.Offerman is down to earth, no-nonsense, a man’s man.  Hats off to Diageo for nailing the association.  ( you made up for the entire GoT blunder...how the hell is the Targaryen a Cardu??!).  

So...onto this pour, which by the way was graciously provided by my buddy @Richard-ModernDrinking .  
The smoke is evident throughout the nose and palette, as to be expected.  It’s a Lagavulin absolutely.  But, here’s the kicker...it’s not as potent as the 16.  I’d expect this to be brutish compared to its older brother.  But it’s not, instead it has a strong smoky caramel flavor throughout, with some fruity backbone.  Really well made; one that I can imagine Mr.Offerman truly enjoying, not such pitching an ad. 

Some places are pricing this above the 16.  Look...it’s good, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves...it’s no better or worse than the 16.  It’s just different.  But I’d not pay more than the 16.  If you see it for less than the 16, a strong buy recommendation."
