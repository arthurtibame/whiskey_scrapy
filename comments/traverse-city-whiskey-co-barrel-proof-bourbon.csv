4.0,Great tasting Bourbon. A little more harsh at the end vs. smoothness but well worth it.

3.75,"Nose: vanilla, toffee, thick burnt caramel 

Body: medium

Palate: spicy, peppery, vanilla, caramel and toffee. 

Finish: medium to long and warming

Note: the best of the three I had from traverse city whiskey. This one is legit."
3.5,"Lots of caramel
And vanilla. No heat reflecting the proof, but not a lot of complexity from a 4 yr old bourbon."

4.5,Wow. Rich. Very good. At this tasting it is rare breed +
4.5,"Right off the nose you know you're in for a wild ride. This bad boy clocks in at 58.4% and it shows. Winning double gold at the 2019 world spirits competition, it does have nice color for a 4 year old bourbon. Nose puts of scents of toffee and butter in tandem with Carmel and just the slightest bit of oak.  Over the tongue it not overly sweet and as it rolls to the back, you feel that proof almost clean out the ears. The finish seems true to the nose and takes the breath away on the first sip but the second and third get smoother. I gave it a high rating due to the nature of being so far away from traditional bourbon country but capturing the true essence of a bourbon. 

Well done, easy to see why you took down double golds for small batch in 2019."

4.0,"Nose is brown sugar and vanilla, but there is also a bit stronger hint of alcohol than I would prefer. Taste is powerful here with heavy Carmel and vanilla before a rising pepper burn emerges. Flavor flavor and more flavor as the layers wash over your tongue.  Finish is a sustained slow burn that leaves a smooth caramel as the fire subsides. Wasn't sure this woukd live up to the San Fran award from 2019, but it definitely does. A very nice pour often!"
