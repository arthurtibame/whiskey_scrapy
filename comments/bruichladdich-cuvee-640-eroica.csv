5.0,"For me, the best dram I've ever tasted. I'll confess to having a massive sweet tooth (I've been told I should stick to drinking ports) and this doesn't disappoint at all in the sweetness department. It's not a spicy-sweetness like you might get from some cognac or port/sherry finishes, but rather something vaguely resembling Glenmorangie Bacalta, just with the saccharine, sugary factor turned up to 11. It hits you all at once on the initial taste but thins out towards the end to reveal a bit more nuance in the form of vanilla, pineapple, and a bit of raspberry. Thankfully, this isn't a terribly viscous fluid so the finish is medium-short, meaning it doesn't stick to your palate and overwhelm whatever you pair it with. Nevertheless, this is still definitely a dessert whiskey through and through."
