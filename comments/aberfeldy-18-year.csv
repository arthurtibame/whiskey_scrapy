3.5,"Totally dissapointing, i expected more since Aberfeldy 12 was pretty good, but then again i don't have much luck with 18yo whiskies.

Bottled at 40%, burnished color.

On the nose, processed bananas, peaches, some salt and nothing else. Fruit aromas lead this one.

On the palate; smooth, pleasant spicyness,  caramel, ginger and ashes. But overall is not that well balanced and kind of boring.  Finish is short and spicy; medium body. 

73% out of a 100. I would not recommend this one."
2.0,"You experience wood chips, coffee beans, a medicinal aroma, a bid of smoke, nuts & nut-shells and caramel. It sure is different to other whiskies and has a uniqueness but while it definitely is a nice whisky, it isn’t for me. 

In my eyes it only touches one spectrum and while that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, this whisky didn’t deliver it in a way that it would be enough for me to drink or buy it again. Not that it is forgettable - it just isn’t very enjoyable."

3.5,Does burn the nose a bit. Strong. Smooth with a bit of a bite at the end.

4.0,"A solid dram, and a budget one at that. For an 18yr old, you cannot beat the $100 price tag. Unfortunately, it is only available at retail outlets. Taste wise? Pancakes. Think big fluffy buttermilk pancakes with a lump of butter and drowning in sirop. Delicious. Do not pass up your chance to pick it up if  find yourself at a duty free shop."

3.0,"A wealthier man's Tobermory 10, with twice the balance but half the pleasure in knowing you spent more money. This isn't a bad whisky, or flawed for that matter. It just isn't inspiring. Floral and herbaceous aromas, with cut grass and a touch of citrus meet your nose, followed with a body that is oily but regretfully light. And while the finish is balanced and pleasant, it is likewise short, vanishing from your mouth and memory quickly."

3.0,Picked this up in Singapore for SG130 which I found as good value. It’s however not much of a step up from the 12 which was pretty good for the price as well. Honeyed sweetness and rather mellow finishes with some cane

4.0,Got it from London Heathrow duty free. Good stuff. Taste the cask at first (not heavily though). Moderately sweet and very smooth. Little vanilla.
