4.5,"I love the 8 year age statement on this bottle, a really great young whisky this is. It's a blended malt mainly consisting of Ben Nevis. It's blended with one other Highland single malt. Rich sherry notes on the nose, Plums, abricots, overripe dark red fruits. As soon as you take a sip this whisky takes over. More sweet and sugary fruits, almost like strawberry jam. No heat for 58% ABV. The finish is long and chewy. Really fantastic stuff! Cheers all"
