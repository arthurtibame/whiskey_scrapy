4.0,"Creamy and silky smooth. Vanilla, maple, and caramel are prominent. Cherries linger in the background with a touch of spice as the bourbon finishes on a whisp of oakey smoke. Not the most challenging of bourbons, but this is a wonderful affair to sip and enjoy at your leisure. Highly recommended as an after-dinner spirit."

null,"Almost too smooth. Dried fruit (citrus?) on the nose. Vanilla, slightly warming on the palate. Very little burn, but just a hint of peppery rye on the finish. Very easy to sip. The critique at this price point is, without question, the lack of stand out taste."

3.0,"For a 20 year old bourbon, it's surprisingly NOT an absolutely over-oaked mess. Though, to be clear, it's still quite heavy on the oak. Without looking up the source of this juice, I'm guessing it's the Buffalo Trace distillery, because it's got a bit of that cherry/apple pie flavour I associate with BT/Eagle Rare. A lot of vanilla here, some custard, sawdust, pencil shavings, cherry liqueur. Slight nuttiness, in particular an almost candied nuttiness. A bit of citrus, like a charred orange peel. Quite dry, with a touch of maple syrup. Slightly chalky aftertaste. And surprisingly hot and alcoholic tasting throughout, considering the ABV and the time it was given to mellow in barrels. 
  
  On the one hand, it's a good-but-not-transcendent bourbon at a fairly high price. On the other hand, you're never going to find another 20 year old bourbon at this price-tag ($99 Canadian) or this easily available. So, ultimately a judgment call: personally, I'm not upset I made the purchase, and I'm glad to have tried a bourbon this old, but what it's ultimately revealed to me is what most distillers in the US have been saying for a long time: the current craze for hyper-aged stuff notwithstanding, bourbon *really* hits its sweet spot between about 8-and-12 years. Anything longer and you're looking at a bit of a gamble."

3.0,"Smells heavy and sweet, like maple syrup, with a hint of fruit. However, it feels thin on the tongue; this a light bourbon. Hints of wood, and wood cleaner or turpentine, some cacao bitterness at the end. Also, not as sweet as the nose suggests. Some warmth and numbing spice lingers, but the finish isn't that complicated. Definitely a pleasant sipper, but at this price you're justified in expecting some more. Hopefully this opens up with time. 3/29/17
  It hasn't been that long, and maybe I'm imagining this, but it does seem have to have developed a bit. Still has a very sticky, syrupy nose, but more vanilla this time around, along with a musky, sour note. A bit sweeter than I remember, but the wood and wood cleaner notes still seem to dominate the palate, and the back end is still spice and bitterness. Looking forward to future tastings. 4/16/17
  Three months later and this has really opened up. More vanilla, honey, and caramel. Still smooth, but more flavor. Some leather notes. Worth the wait. 7/3/17"

3.0,"So, despite my mostly disappointed experience with Orphan Gifted Horse, this bottle of 20 Year Old Barterhouse has been staring at me from atop the bar challenging me to redeem the Orphan Barrel/Diageo brand.  So, I caved in last night and popped the cork on another $90 ""rescued"" bourbon.

This offering comes in at 90.2 proof and is a nice, roasted caramel color while giving off hints of dark, roasted almonds and sweet, maraschino cherries on the nose.  There isn't much oak to be found.  That's kind of unexpected if this stuff has been truly resting for 20 years.

On the tongue, there's some cherry again along with a quite a lot of spicy, peppery oak.  That's it, though.  I expected a lot more complexity for sure.  Even the finish is a bit one-trick pony:  bitter burn.  I was hoping for some vanilla or something.  Nada.

Overall, it's better than Gifted Horse, but not by much and it certainly isn't worth $90+.  At this point, the only Orphan I've had that lived up to the hype was the 22 year old Rhetoric.  Good luck finding that, much less for a reasonable price.  3.25 stars.  Keep sippin' elsewhere my friends..."

Straight- light peppery notes at first that quickly fades to a sweet vanilla flavor, warm finish that seems to lack depth.  Drops of water- still a spicy start that fades to vanilla but then some of the leather, oak, and smoke starts to come thru, much better depth.  This one really does respond well to a few drops of water.  Overall a nice 20 year that's just needs to be handled correctly, find the right amount of water and it will shine."

Notes: I really enjoyed this pour. While the oak is absolutely in the forefront of the flavor, it doesn’t overpower the drink. While it isn’t a complicated sip, it isn’t so simple that you won’t enjoy it. If I had one thing I would change, I think Barterhouse could benefit from a slightly higher proof. Perhaps the heat of around 55% alcohol would liven it up. I know some may think the Orphan Barrel project is kind of gimmicky, but I think it is a great idea. Otherwise we wouldn’t have access to solid bottles like Barterhouse. Given that the heat and spice level is low on this pour, go ahead and drink it neat. Might not be your favorite, but you would be hard pressed not to enjoy it"

3.0,"Another Orphan Barrel review following last nights ""Gifted Horse"". This is Barterhouse, a 20 year old Kentucky straight bourbon. Bottled at 45% ABV and is natural color of a dark copper. Most likely non chill filtered. 

Fairly sweet on the nose. Fruity. Apples, like straight out of the orchard. Dark berries and pineapple. A very light sensation of bubblegum and cotton candy. Very light oak, a little dill and nutmeg. Vanilla, cherries, corn and simple syrup. Not a very deep nose, light but pleasant. More woody/wood spices would have been a plus. 

Very sweet on the palate as well. Corn, cherries and a little pepper. Apple skin, baking spices, but missing the cinnamon, and a little caramel. No real complexity, especially for a 20 year old bourbon. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is a little thin. 
A medium long finish with corn and apples. 

I have to say I'm surprised by the underperformance by this bourbon. I would think that 20 years in a new oak barrel would have imparted much more flavor, especially in the oak department. It's all but missing any cinnamon or toffee. It's easy to drink, but for the age and the price of $80 locally, I would have expected some much more flavorful. Thanks again to Lee for supplying both of these Orphan Barrel whiskies, but I doubt I'll be trying any more in the future. 3.5

Taste - Tannic oaky sweetness, sweet dark caramel, hint of milk chocolate, like a slightly oaky dark chocolate covered Almond Roca candy, light cinnamon spice up front, light bitter oaked brown simple at the tail end as it goes down.

Finish - Drying oaky chocolate covered toffee, light oaky/almond skin bitter/sweet.

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - I hate to admit this but I'm actually a fan of this one. It has a lot of the flavors that I love in a bourbon which are dark chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Fantastic nose. I'm a fan of oak if it's balanced and this does it quite well. Reminds me of this one Woodford Reserve Double Oaked Single Barrel I had which I absolutely loved. A tiny bit more tannic than that one, but it hits all the right notes for me.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, If the price was right."

4.0,"Nose (3.75):  Very soft not alot going on here.  Maybe some carmel and maple syrup.  Not a bad nose but kind of just sits there.

Palate (4.25):  Maple syrup, pancakes, and butter.  I liked it.  Definately a sweeter bourbon but it tastes like a hearty breakfast.  It is not complex but it is inviting.  Much better than the nose.

Finish (4.0):  Leaves with a puff of smoke but not a natural smokiness.  Almost like that liquid smoke.  It is oaky and lingers but the ""liquid smoke"" kind of turned me off.

It isn't bad, not my favorite but I could see you liking it if you are in the mood to have your hotcakes and syrup in a glass.  20 years may have been too long in the barrel because this is a bit timid for me.  This would benefit greatly in a higher proof.  The flavors just are not there for me."
4.0,For sure a sweeter bourbon. A soft maple finish which I kinda like.

5.0,"What a perfect, soft bourbon.  Admittedly, there is almost no hint of bite anymore, which might be a negative to some.  Nonetheless, I found this to be sweet and fruity almost like a bourbon crossed with port or sherry, almost like a hybrid product"

4.0,The color is a beautiful rich dark copper. The nose had a nice combination of oak and dark fruits. The taste was consistent with the aroma. A nice surprise. These long aged bourbons can go either way; Better than I expected.
4.0,Delicious. Smells and tastes like you just walked into a rick house.

4.0,"This is far more gentle and less oaky than I expected for a 20 year old bourbon. Classic notes of caramel, vanilla, honey and a bit of nuttiness to it. Like Walnut husks. This is an excellent dram and easy to sip on the deck"

3.75,"For the price tag I was expecting more but this is easy drinking and extremely well balanced. A lot of the usual bourbon notes...some wood, vanilla, a little caramel but not a ton. I like it but can’t believe the price tag. I should remove so points for that but since it’s my friend’s bottle I didn’t do the buying 🤷‍♂️"

2.5,Was hoping for more. Had it the evening after having one of the Bardstown series bottles which was very good. Nose is good but the taste isn’t as solid and falls short of the nose.

4.25,Oh shit! This is good! Tried blind against belle meade sherry and liked this more. Little more spice than expected.

4.25,"This is actually the first time i have ever heard of the Orphan Barrels. It seems Diageo has some special, unique, ""orphan"" Barrels, that contain diferent whiskies from undisclosed distilleries. Actually a pretty good story, because they say that this are all very limited bottles and once they are gone, well... they aren't coming back.

Bottled at 45.1%abv,

Ok. The story is something. The tasting and nosing notes are another.

Caramel in the nose. Metallic coins, creme brulee. A little toffee. Vanilla. A little refined aroma notes. 

On the palate, very herbal and butterscotch. Apricots. 

Aftertaste is medium, long, very pleasant. It is a fine bourbon. But it is not a Pappy. Not a John E. Fitzgerald 20yo. Compared to those two, this one is fair. 85 over 100."
