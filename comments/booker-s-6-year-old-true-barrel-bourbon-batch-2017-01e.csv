4.25,"We tried 15 whiskies tonight and this one was last and came out tops. Damn fine dram and only $70USD. Could drink it straight no worries but I added some water. Beautifull viscous spicy caramel. My type of bourban to a tee, no Dr cherry pepper, harshness. Very, very nice.  Luckily for me I ordered two samples by mistake so I'll get to try this one all over again soon. 4.5

Despite me not being a big bourbon fan these days this is still damn good. Probably more around the 4.25 mark these days but really love the profile which is more than can be said for most these days."
