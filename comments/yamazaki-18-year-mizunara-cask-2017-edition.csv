5.0,"I’ll never be able to afford this, but it’s still my favorite of all time. Honey, floral, sweet, oaky"
5.0,"Stunning with notes of vanilla, coconut, plum, cinnamon, banana, caramel, orange peel, chocolate, and sandalwood on the nose with honey, plums, dried fruit, and floral on the palate and a long spicy peppery sandalwood honey finish."

5.0,"Warm spice, dried fruits a lingering effervescent finish. My wife bought me a birthday dram at The Whiskey House in San Diego  last week. (Yes it was stupid expensive) I’m ruined ... seek it out."

5.0,"Incredible whisky. Flavours are complex and exciting, but also inviting at the same time. Gets better as you go along too. Was incredibly fortunate to try this, a bartender took a liking to me and offered me some from his secret bottle. I get what all the fuss is about."
5.0,"Incredibly rare and a beautifully balanced whisky. It's all there - dark fruit, spicy oak, floral notes. Very fortunate to have tasted this. Unique and unrivaled in its use of full maturation in mizunara casks."
