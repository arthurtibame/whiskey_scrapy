4.5,"Sweet, complex"
4.5,"Candied fruit, nuts, spicy notes, slight smoke and oak notes. Very smooth."
4.0,"Lots of vanilla sweetness, along with some peppery spice from the grains. Not much bitterness from the barrel, despite the strong vanilla influence. Also, despite it being a very young spirit (they told me at the distillery it ages for 9 months in quarter casks), it doesn't have the spikiness typical of other young spirits. I can't wait to have a chance to try it again."
