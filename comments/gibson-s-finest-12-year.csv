4.0,"Light, silky smooth, and sweet. Well balanced with soft caramel, oak, floral, and soft spice notes. $30 in Ontario."
4.0,"Quite nice. Not as nice as Gibson's 18 year, but very few whiskys are. The nose is slightly harsh with some alcohol burn, which also manifests itself in the mouth, but all-in-all this an excellent whisky. I do prefer the Sterling because it's a bit fruity, but you really can't go wrong with the 12 Year Old."

4.0,"The first thing that hit me on the nose was butterscotch. Like, ""holy butterscotch, Batman!"" levels - rich, oily, creamy butterscotch, exactly like the hard candies in the bright gold wrapper. With that is coconut, floral notes, caramel, and a tiny hint of cinnamon. The palate is light and a bit fruity, with a less obnoxiously butterscotch quality, milk chocolate, coconut, vanilla, and an oily, but not heavy, body. This is a light, fresh, perfect-for-summertime whisky...but light doesn't mean insubstantial here. Plenty good neat, but I suspect it would hold up well on the rocks or with a bit of club soda for those times when you're really looking to go light and refreshing."

4.0,A great example of a Canadian Whiskey.   Smooth and easy to drink.  Cannot beat the price either.

3.0,"On the nose, a certain olive oil nuttiness that I can't quite place, fresh baked light rye bread, some marzipan and butterscotch. Extremely smooth, coats the palate with an orchard fruit sweetness that gives way to a savoury sensation that ends without notice. Short finish. Overall, quite unique, a bit different from most other Canadian whiskies I have tried, and overall a great value at $32.95 in Ontario."

2.0,Very surprised this is a 12 year old. Gibson's NAS shows just as much character while being only half the age. Not a fan.

2.75,"Caramel, fruity nose. Sweet through the palate to the finish. Not a ton going on, but for the price it’s a nice easy drinking whisky. Finishes a little spicy."
1.5,Not good. Maybe because of an older small bottle

3.75,"Easy 3.5 all day Our cousin Jeff introduced us to it as his pick for best sipping whiskey and I have to admit it is by far the most tastey smooth and complex whiskey I have experienced for $25 Cad so like 5 dollars USD ??! LOL fruit, slight oak, spicey, sweet burnt sugar and smooth would love to put this in with all the worlds whiskeys $25 and under and see if it would win the number 1 spot"

4.25,"Gibson's Select Rare (12 Year) has a bright gold appearance, clarity, and prominent alcohol legs. The aroma is of pungent, full sweet corn whisky, with some whiffs of rye spice and mild wood & vanilla. The flavor is of those elements, with a somewhat lingering finish. RJT"
