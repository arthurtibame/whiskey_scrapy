3.5,Nutty caramel nose which makes way for a flavor not unlike candied walnuts with burnt toast. Nice cinnamon finish.

3.0,"Very different taste. Kind of taste like vitamins. I don’t taste any peanuts. Still debating if I like this or not. 
It has a similar taste to Joseph Magnus bourbon."

4.0,"No this does not taste like peanuts. 

Tasting notes: very bourbonish and you get a slight hint of bourbon for the finish. Highly recommend."
3.75,Greasy smell. Licorice. Taste comes back around. Lingers for a while. And comes back in a second wave. Smoky for sure. Honey. Good heat. Lingering taste is better than initial.

5.0,"Tobacco, bacon grease, mostly delicious savory notes with a bit of butterscotch maybe. Legs for days, oily, love it."

3.75,Definitely a polarizing bottle for whatever reason but I personally like the level of richness and heat. Reminds me of George Dickel BiB 13 and Barrell SiB - two of my current faves.

3.75,Not as sweet as the Straight bourbon.  Distinct flinestone vitamin taste.
1.75,Interesting. Nose smells like vitamins  a little bit of fruity too. It has a bit of Carmel to the tastes and not to much heat it has a chewable vitamin taste come up on the finish. It’s not bad but the little bit of vitamin taste isn’t the best and once you taste it it doesn’t go away. It would be a little bit higher rated if it weren’t  80 bucks or 13 and it being a 13 year old
