4.0,"So, thanks to @Richard-ModernDrinking I am able to try a few more variations of the Compass Box Great King St Artist’s Blend Single Marrying Cask. This is Artist’s Blend refilled back into some of the casks used to make the original blend and aged for another year, then bottled at near cask strength. This particular cask (No 68) was bottled at 49% ABV and offers a deeper reflection of what the Artist’s Blend can be if left alone a little longer.

So, this is the fifth different batch I’ve been able to try. This final sample from Richard seems to ride a fine line between fruity and grainy.  It is possibly the best of all of the Marrying Cask bottles I’ve been able to try.

The nose has tons of lively citrus and oak cask notes.  The fruit is a bit restrained, but it’s also lightly floral.  A good bit of depth here if you wait out the nose a bit.

The palate is lemony and citrus forward, while being a bit more lively and smooth.  The flavors mingle with orchard fruits hanging around well past mid sip.  It’s more oily and warming than the others and creates a greater mouthfeel.  The oak cask provides a solid backbone here, too.

The finish might be the longest of all 5 I’ve tried, but it still isn’t extremely long.  The added length turns a bit harsh at the very end, but the sweet fruits really keep it from ruining the overall experience.

This one ticks in at 3.5-3.75 stars and I believe if this one was regularly available I’d choose this over the normal Artist Blend.  If this can be had for $40- it’s a great deal.  Thanks again to Richard for sending me pours of 4 more of the Marrying Cask bottles.  This was a fun experiment.  Cheers, my friends."
3.0,"Thanks to @Richard-ModernDrinking, I took this sample with me to Orlando on a business trip—-thought it would be a good reprieve after long hours in the office.  I had previously the Highland version, which I found a more complex dram.  This one came across lighter, more subtle...maybe suited for mix drinks?  Interesting experiment.  Thanks Richard!"
3.0,"A lighter nose than the Highland cask finishes, with a hint of mint and lemon. In the mouth it's sweet, with a tamarind-like sourness to its long finish. See cask #31 for more information on this series."
