3.0,"Nose is almost identical to glenfiddich 12. Similar taste profile too although rougher. Tastes like an improperly finished glenfiddich 12. It's almost like they have picked a flavor note and gone with it, unfortunately it isn't a particularly good note."
3.0,"Mild fruity sweetness on the front, gives way to a mild peated character"

3.5,Hints of vanilla in an overall balanced scotch that is light on peaty flavor.
4.0,This single malt is a great value.  Carmel is the omnipresent note right from the first sniff to the last swallow.  Light and easy to drink.

Taste - caramel, oak spice
Finish - thin and a bit hot"

3.0,"Good color, easy nose, simple yet full flavor with notes of salted caramel. Wonderfully aged and a good speyside"
2.0,"Nose: drying paint, almost harsh fumes (like I’m in a Sherman Williams store),  alcohol, will subside if you let it sit and open up for a few minutes, perfume, bright fruits, pear, apple, some (sticky) sweetness, darker sugar notes, hint of old leather. 
Taste: sweet, maybe honey, moderate fruitiness, spiciness takes over, oak spice, cinnamon like note, ginger, slight earthy tone on the finish. Finish is medium but fades quick enough. It’s middle of the road in my book."

3.0,"Light in color. Very light smoke and hints of honey in the nose. Taste is a tad bitter and short with a dry finish. Not bad for the price point, but leaves you wanting something more."

2.75,"This was a small gift/joke that was given to me by some friends who asked me what they could bring over for dinner (appetizer or dessert). I jokingly said scotch.  To our small humored surprise, they did and purchased this 12 year.

An ever light nose of simple, baseline aromas: sweetness, fruitiness and cereals. Butterscotch, honey encapsulates the sweetness. Orchard fruits of apples and pears embody the fruits. Barley and oatmeal with a touch of leather captures earthiness. 

The body is watery thin delivering a handful of flavors; as if the weight of many flavors wouldn’t be able to be supported by the thin body.  On the sweeter side of vanilla and honey. The sweetness fades quick and turns slightly spicy with ginger and cinnamon.  A mineral, earthy, woody quality comes through at the fade. 

The finish is simple: drying oak tannins and orange zest with a slight nuttiness  that last for a medium length. 

A simple straightforward dram that does what it was designed to do: easy and enjoyable at a bargain of a price.  Can compete with the likes of Glenlivet or Glenfiddich and can save you $10 to $20.  [84/100][$32][Tasted: 11/22/19]"
