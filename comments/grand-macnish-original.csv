2.75,"A cheap Blended Scotch, this can be considered as a smooth whisky, with ghostly flavors that fade quickly, but i guess it works for cocktails. 

Bottled (in a strange looking bottle) at 40%abv 

On the nose, it feels young. Right away grain whisky aroma. Butter. Cheap Butter chocolate. Acetone. Fresh fields. Aroma dissapears almost completely after 4 mins. Maize. After first sip a ghostly lemon note can be found.

The palate follows the same path with Grain notes, very Smooth, Vanilla and Honey. Gets peppery. Easy to drink.

Aftertaste has a very dim smoke note. 
Almondy. Its very short and dim.

Very easy to drink, this is young but not rough. Not interesting, i guess you can taste it and forget about it. 56 over 100."
