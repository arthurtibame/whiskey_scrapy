5.0,"This is a fantastic bourbon, definitely something worth trying and adding to your collection. Its rich sweet corn and oak flavors seem to blend perfectly to make this New York Straight Bourbon a force to be reckoned with. It has a long, resonating, and very pleasant finish that will leave you very satisfied."
