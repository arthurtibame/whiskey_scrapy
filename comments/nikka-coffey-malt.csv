4.0,"Intense and very fruity nose with lots of tangerine, then smoke and pecan and brazil nuts. Pouring it in a large  tulip shaped (red wine) helped very much in catching the full richness of the nose.
  Taste:  Medium rich, nicely balanced.  In the mouth initially less fruity than on the nose, but a week after opening the fruit unfolds here too, with apples and oranges. Vanilla, hints of maple suryp (but not sweet) and towards the end come spice, smoke and some iodine. 
  Very nice whisky for the price."
5.0,"Incredibly sweet and fruity whisky, love the tangerines, mango and coco flavour! Works best for me if you let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes."

4.0,"Nose - Clean crisp floral yet spicy. Filtered honeyed apple/pear juice and late harvest sultanas.
Taste - Lightly bitter white tea, grape/pear filtered hard cider, white pepper spice/heat, more late harvest sultanas, hints of rum and slight steamed milk sweetness and thinned, yet creamy mouthfeel.
Finish - Lingering spice on tongue, lightly tannic oversteeped tea bitterness, white cranberry juice cocktail in that it's a very crisp, slightly tart, sweetness, but tastes a bit artificial.
Score - 79/100"

4.0,"Wonderful whiskey, but I wonder if the name wrongly influences the aromas some have used to describe it - as if the word ""coffey"" somehow subconsciously makes us taste and smell ""coffee"" here. Blind-tasted, my experience was quite pleasant and complex. The nose has wonderful notes of nuttiness (maybe pecans, maybe almonds) and a certain fruitness that is evocative of granny smith apples. The body is well-rounded, though on the verge of disintegrating at 45% ABV, with a palate rich in chocolate and caramel (someone here likened it to a crème brulée and I think it's spot on). The finish is incredibly smooth with enough presence to last a minute or so. All in all a really good japanese whiskey."

3.0,"On the nose, slight hints of nuts, vinegar, ash, wood, and maple syrup. This tastes like a country breakfast, the maple syrup transfers  to the palate and I get some smoked meat and cereal notes. Not what I was expecting from a Japanese whisky. On some sips I even get chocolate-covered bacon. There's spice on the backend, which lingers even after the warmth going down subsides. I like the Coffey Grain better, but this is another good offering by Nikka. 4/14/17"

Taste lingers and brings deep notes of crumble, cookies and cafe au lait. This is one to cherish."

4.5,"Nose: Toasted cereal, buttered toast, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, vanilla, panettone, baked banana. There's a tiny ashy hint. Adding a drop of water brings out a little oak aroma but it mutes the nose too much.

Palate: Rich, creamy, silken arrival. Milk chocolate, creme caramel, coconut, nutmeg, butter, caramel, savoiardi biscuits and some light oaky notes. The addition of water unleashes several types of honey and more varieties of cereal.

Finish: Medium. Mildly spicy with grainy mocha flavours. There is an interesting segue to fruitiness as it fades, and a delightful lingering sweetness.

This is an excellent whisky, and together with the Coffey Grain from Nikka it's a duet that you need to hear. 

The nose and palate are intensely cereal driven, with hints of every type of grain and baked product you can imagine and it is wonderfully mouth-watering.

The fruit part of the character is subtle and it's not about bright citrus fruit at all. It's much warmer, heavier and oilier and is totally integrated with the cereal profile. Think banana bread, walnut loaf or avocado mashed on whole grain toast.

If adding water do so very carefully, just a couple of drops at a time. This whisky is fine neat, but water brings out notes that are just as nice. However as much as it loves water, this whisky can't swim to save itself and you can ruin a wonderful experience very easily. Don't even think about putting it anywhere near ice or mixers.

Delightful, and arguably the best tasting and best value Japanese whisky that you can still obtain fairly easily.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

Palate: Fruit preserves, mainly peaches again or apricots, it sweet but in no way cloying to me.  I get no smoke at all but all in all it’s beautifully clean and just very nice.  I get a warm medium to long finish with this one, with lingering peach and powdered sugar.  I hope I can always find this."

4.5,"I must say I was intrigued by this dram of how it transitions and shows you different notes throughout the tasting.

The nose has a full toffee and vanilla tone just like a Bourbon would have, even though this is malt and not maize. So I expected a similar experience.

Now to my surprise the palate gives you something completely different!
A sensation of fresh fruits, almost on the Orange side with citrus peals that gives a tart feel on the tongue. Very fesh and light.

On the finish you still have a light feel with a moment of fruitiness which then transitions towards dark chocolate, hazelnuts and some oak.
A bottle worthy of the shelf!

4.0,"Here we've got one from Japan's number 2 brand, Nikka. Suntory and its products take the cake as the clear number one, but Nikka isn't too far off in second place. This only refers to notoriety, not necessarily quality. I need to do some more digging to determine the latter. So here it is, my first Nikka review.

Nose: Huge honey note, followed by banana, toffee, butterscotch, and vanilla. Graham cracker and marshmallow. Extremely sweet, even a bit syrupy. Some brown sugar and maple. Slightly nutty (walnut). This one drives right up to the border of overly-sweet, but stops just short. It noses like banana walnut pancakes with maple syrup. Very good.

Palate: Still big honey, vanilla, butterscotch, toffee, brown sugar, and marshmallow notes. Walnut as well. The banana is now accompanied by some apple, pear, and apricot. There's chocolate, but it's more akin to a powdered hot chocolate than anything else. Slight oak spice. The palate trades the pancakes for a fruit bowl, but is otherwise relatively close to the nose.

*5 months later and I'm back. Definitely some tropical fruit here. Mango and pineapple. Especially mango. In fact, I'd say that's now the most dominant note on the palate. Interesting what time and oxidation do to a whisky.

Finish: The idea of the banana walnut pancakes with maple syrup resurfaces here, but very briefly. Then it's cinnamon, nutmeg, and oak spice for what adds up to moderate finish, maybe even on the short side. A bit underwhelming compared to the rest of the experience, but it's respectable in its own right.

Damn good stuff. The Suntory products have always reminded me of Scotch. This Nikka Coffee Malt, however, is completely unique to any other category of whisky. A lot to like here. Great balance, only dropping off slightly at the finish.

I paid $63, and feel I got my money's worth. I'll admit that Japanese whisky, in general, is overpriced. But within the context of the category, this appropriately priced. Great experience, looking forward to the Coffee Grain next. Nice job, Nikka."

Palate: Full bodied on the palate, malt flavor stands out.  Somewhat one dimensional but a full flavored smooth finish with an appropriate hint of coffee that's not overpowering. Did not add water as drinking it neat is perfect 

Finish:. Leaves a pleasant lingering coffee aftertaste, great whisky for the price and consistently find myself wanting more."

3.25,"Passes for a syrupy apple juice in the glass - golden wheat with a touch of oily weight.  Grain-forward nose, with white pear, apple blossom, and allspice. Subdued but noticeable puff of spice.

The taste is sharp and tart, opening with mounds of orange rind plus unaged grappa, aspartame, and white pepper. A dash of walnut: equally rich and bitter. The aspartame sweetness builds while lavender, sage, and licorice arrive. The citrus, herbal notes, and aspartame continue through a pronounced puckering tingle that lingers on the finish.  The tongue stays awash with synthetic orange cough syrup.  It could be mistaken for a very spicy highland grain whisky (note that I am unaware of any examples of this made-up category... but it comes to mind when tasting).  Despite the myriad flavors, it all feels quite cohesive and had me feeling like it was all one huge (unidentifiable) flavor through the first quarter of the glass.

The experience is unique, intriguing, and has appeal.  For me, however, the positives get torpedoed by the dominant saccharine notes.  The craftsmanship is unmistakable, but unfortunately I am strongly averse to most artificial sweeteners and just can't look past those flavors, which of course may not be an issue for others.  Halfway through the bottle so I'm sure its not just a fleeting impression.  My appreciation of this pour has improved with time, but not enough to recommend it unless those tasting notes sound right up your alley."

4.0,"My favorite single malt whisky. Normally I'm not a big fan of single malt whiskies, as I'm not fond of the wine/sherry aftertaste, but luckily that's not present in this one. For the most part, I taste vanilla, butterscotch and milk chocolate. As I'm more of a bourbon guy, it's no wonder I like it a lot. I got this one as a gift for my 28th birthday."

4.5,"The backbone of a good Japanese dram: sweet. Spicy. Aromatic.
Nose: Sweet creamy soda, vanilla bean and slight caramel. 
Palate: Stewed peaches and pear with a Butter Menthol oiliness. Milk chocolate undertones with shortbread.
Finish: Like that last taste of a Creme Brulee. More peach sweetness and a slight hint of coconut."
4.5,"Top shelf for sweet whiskey lovers. This is a sensational whiskey. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the slight acetone aroma on the nose. Beyond that, I get banana and heavy malt on the nose. The palate is extraordinary- citrus, gives way to a creamy richness and hints of cocoa. The flavour is incredibly deep and nuanced. Finish is slightly spicy but with a wonderful dried berries note. A must try for any malt lover."
4.25,"An excelent expression, specially for the price. The main perk of this whisky is that it is a single malt but it has been distilled using coffey stills (continuous or column stills) which are usually used only to distill grain whiskies. 

Bottled at 45%abv, tawny color.

On the nose, very citric. Nice. Orange, lime; 
Dark chocolate; Tang orange juice. Wet Rice (no japanese cliché, this is really the aroma i got). Soap. 

On the palate, very steady more of the same: chocolate, oranges, pepper. 

Aftertaste is nice with almonds and chocolate with ginger infusions. Very well done.

Overall this is a great everyday dram. Mostly citric and sweet. Good job from Nikka. 88 over 100."
