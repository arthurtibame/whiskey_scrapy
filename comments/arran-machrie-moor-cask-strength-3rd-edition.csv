3.5,"Really fresh peat notes. The sting of the 58% is real. Smells sweet like a teriyaki beef jerky.
Behind the alcohol burn there is a lovely full underlying sweetness of red apples, grass, dried plum, and pure chocolate.
The finish is surprisingly short with a little weird bitterness like orange pith and overextracted coffee."
3.5,"I preferred the Caol Ila moscatel finish. This one is an interesting dram, you get an intense sweet peat hit up front which immediately dissipates and a blast of ethanol washes the flavour away a leaves a long warming glow then a weird pear flavour on the mid tongue. Interesting but not a big fan."

3.75,"This is an interesting dram.  It tastes like a grain whiskey in some ways. The alcohol is strong.  The flavors - vanilla, floral, a touch of spice - come fast and all at once and fade as the alcohol kicks in.  I haven't tried the non-cask version, but I'd like to.  I have a feeling this is one instance in which the lower ABV will allow the flavors to blossom. The smoke is lovely, however."

3.5,"Nose: Smoke and peat, pine resin. Light floral and fruity notes way down deep. It’s a somehow distant, very dry and ethereal nose.

Palate: Taken neat the arrival is dry and spicy, then there is an intense alcohol heat. Suddenly the development springs from nowhere with an explosion of fruity flavours – grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, cranberries, goji berries – but then it fades just as quickly as it appeared. One of the most fleeting developments I’ve ever tasted. There is a subtle background smokiness throughout.

Finish: Medium, a lingering astringent and hot sweetness with some oak tannin.
  
The aromas and flavours of this whisky are reserved, distant and locked up tight as a drum by the high alcohol level.  It has a fruity and lightly smoky character overall, but the fruitiness is dry rather than sweet.

When taken neat it’s most enjoyable 5 minutes after finishing the dram, when the palate has relaxed and overcome the alcohol shock and the after-echoes of the whisky reveal its full character.

When diluted down to under 50% it is much more approachable, but there is a fine line between taming the high abv and washing out the delicate character. If adding water do so very slowly, drop by drop, and allow it to sit and recover for 10 minutes.

A curious malt that is almost but not quite immensely satisfying. I can’t help but feel that it was bottled at far too high a strength for such a delicate and subtle whisky and I prefer the non-cask strength Machrie Moor expressions. They seem more balanced and complete.

It's also one of the most natural presentations of a whisky I've ever encountered. Add a couple of drops of water and within moments a thick mist arises in the spirit - it must be seething with heavy oils and has only had the most cursory of filtrations. Yay!

  “Good” : 3.5 stars"
