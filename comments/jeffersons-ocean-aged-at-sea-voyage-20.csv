3.25,"To this engineer the concept is really cool: keep the whiskey moving, even rolling at sea, to get the most out of the barrel oak. When I took the first sip it was obvious that the agitation had achieved the desired extraction of all the oak's secrets.  As I understand, these extracted compounds break down in some cases, combine, or polymerize in others as the whiskey ages in a typical warehouse. Pulling out the extra lactones and what not darkens the blend and adds tons of flavor,  but no maturity. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the end effect struck me more like an oaked moonshine than a fine bourbon. I'm not an expert, so maybe it's just me.  Still worth trying, because you never know until you try."

3.5,Creamy head. Good mid heat that gets hotter as it finishes. Not a huge flavor profile but delicious. A little pricy

4.25,"Very rounded feeling, never hits too high or low.  A bit mild on flavor, but not in an unpleasant way."
3.0,Smooth and balanced. But nothing special for $70.

3.75,Good flavor but a more harsh burn than I would expect from an older bourbon.  Overall I would buy something else for the price.
