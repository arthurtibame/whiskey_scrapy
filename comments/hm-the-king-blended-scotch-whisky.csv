2.0,"Ok nose, rough middle, strong finish."
3.0,"Appearance: The color I see in my Glencairn is a honey or a straw yellow. With a swirl I notice the legs, medium in thickness, easing their way back down slowly.

Nose: On the nose a light smoke note starts off the ride quickly pairing with a honey floral sweetness. Caramel and earthy moss come together following the honey-smoke like one of those awkward couples that realize by the end of the movie they were made for eachother.

Taste: Notes of vanilla and red apple lead the way into the palate. I also get n essence of ripe peach, whole grain toast, and cherries.

Finish: The finish lasts decently long after an initial bite in the swallow, and, to quote HM’s website, ends, “with subdued smoke and late peat.”

Thoughts: Well my consensus is, for an apparently lower shelf pick, this is a really good dram for your money. It’s affordable, the well designed packaging doesn’t cause it to look like a bottom shelfer, it's approachable and inoffensive to most palates I would wager, all around though there are better tasting options this is still good! HM The King, thanks for the taste! Sláinte!"
