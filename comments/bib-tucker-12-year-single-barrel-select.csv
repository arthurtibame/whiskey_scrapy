4.0,Nose is clean bourbon corn and vanilla. Taste is a clean bourbon corn taste. What is great is no bad after tastes. You can taste hints of the charred barrel as an aftertaste.
3.75,"dark and oaky like sleeping in a forgotten barrel. heavy spice of old, wet oak. a flash of peanut in the cinnamon red hot finish"
4.5,"Floral Sweet Nose with a little spice. Bold flavors of Carmel, Vanilla, and Oak Tannons.  Smooth finish.  Delightful."

4.0,"Just got around to cracking this Bourbon after an amazing day with the the family and it's really pretty darn good. 

This is a single barrel offering that is age stated at 12 yrs old and is distilled and bottled in TN. So basically we can assume the distillate is sourced from Dickel. They disclose that it's double distilled and unlike regular Dickel distillate it's non chill filtered. They also disclose that it's barrel entry is lower than the industry norm so this could potentially be bottled at cask strength (I have seen some as low as 46% ABV from Dickel). The rub here ofcourse is the price point coming in at a hefty $129.99. Let's dive into the tasting:

It enters very rich and viscous! Great mouthfeel and the initial notes are sweet. Rich natural vanilla, butterscotch. Hint of cherry as well leading to an array of baking spices. The finish add roasted cinnamon almonds, oak and barrel spices that linger. The finish is really long. I poured some of my 13yr old Cask Strength Smooth Ambler sourced from Dickel (53.3% ABV) and it's no comparison. This is richer, denser with a much longer finish. It's also has none of the ""Dickel funk"" the Smooth Ambler retains. 

All in all I am really digging this bottle. Is it worth $129.99?? Honestly it's still hard to justify but it is damn tasty. This is one of the great things about getting Whiskey as a gift, I would have otherwise never bought it but l am very happy to own it. Cheers All!!"
