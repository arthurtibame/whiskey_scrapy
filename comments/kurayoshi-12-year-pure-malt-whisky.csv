3.5,"Smoky finish, nuts and fruits low sharp mellow"
3.5,"Nose: macallan-esq sherry apricot nose with caramel and pepper
Body: medium
Palate: malt, vanilla
Finish: medium
Note: this one is ok, not enough body. I guess I don’t see what the fuss is about with these Japanese malts. They seem to fall flat for me. And again more rice."

2.5,"Nose: cherry and oak, but rather smooth/flat. 
Flavour: first strong alcohol hit, then some sweeter notes
Finish: almost wood polish like aftertaste. 

...not really for me."

2.5,"Lightly sweet on the nose. Spicy with a medium bite, hints of vanilla. Short finish, a bit less refined than I would expect from a 12 year."

4.0,Fruity nose. Taste fruit and wood notes.  I would mistake this one for a scotch.

3.5,"Soft on the nose with musty notes of dried leaves, bergamot and dried fruit"
3.75,3.75 alot like Macallan but sweeter.  Clean initial taste of sherry and then a very sweet long aftertaste. A little hot

3.75,"I had a Kurayoshi tasting night, and i had the Sherry Cask, the 12yo and the 18yo. Got to say this one was the loser on that night, because even if it is not a bad whisky, it is not something you will remember. 

Actually Kurayoshi is a blended malt (pure malt in japan) from scottish and japanese whiskies, from the Matsui distillery. 

Bottled at 43%abv

On the nose, it is an speyside whisky doppelganger with a little earthy note (which i found in every Kurayoshi).full Citric notes. Toffee. Grapefruit, Strong alcohol note; passion fruit. Earthy and Citric. Raw rice and Floral notes like a cheap Air freshener from a Taxi (a cab).

On the palate, too straightforward, but nice i guess. Dulce de leche (toffee), citric and pepper.

Aftertaste is intersting. Earthy like mud. Ginger. Very dry. 

Overall this is a whisky that is not bad, but lacks emotion. I guess that it's intention is to compete with other 12 year old whiskies out there (which might be the whiskies top competition) and for that purpose, it is a good offer. 77 over 100."
4.0,Impartial to sipping whiskeys.  This one is definitely my favorite experience.  It's got a fragrant nose and a fruit forward and embracing first sip.
3.75,"Earthy, malty and nutty"
