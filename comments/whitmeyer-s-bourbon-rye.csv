4.25,"Strong!  Hits you with a sweet fire, but this bourbon rye has a sweet aftertaste.  Woody notes, a slightly charred butterscotch flavor comes across as you let the whiskey linger on the palate.  Pairs well with a nice fire and cold night."

4.25,"Nose: bold, sweet honey, vanilla, caramel, and cherry with a dusting of corn and light baking spices.

Palate: oily and rich mouthfeel. Honey, vanilla, light cherry, with a caramelized corn note. Towards the back half of the taste a eucalyptus and herbal note shows and finishes with an oak ding and baking spice.

Final notes: I was recommended to purchase this from my Spec's guy (Texas liquor store), because ""it tastes like a $60 whisky in a $37 bottle"". If this was priced at $60, I'd still buy it. It's just a very rich and flavorful experience both on the nose and palate. For pairing, I'd argue that this is a whisky to be enjoyed by itself. However, a cigar pairing that has medium/medium-full bodied notes of cinnamon, oak, and baking spices would be very enjoyable.

Disclaimer: the requested whisky lists a 55.8% abv, however, my identical bottle is 50.5%. I believe proof on this whisky varies from batch to batch. Mine is specifically batch 7."
