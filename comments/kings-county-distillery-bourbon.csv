3.0,Very immature bourbon.  Heavy corn flavor with limited flavor profile.  Needs to age another five years.

1.0,"I've had the chocolate iteration of this brand.  I won some at a company party.  It has to be one of the most aweful flavored whiskies I've ever had.  It smells of super dark cacao, and licorice.  It hits hard and leaves a synthetic syrup residue in your mouth.  I'll be passing this off to somebody else who is curious about this little quirk."

2.0,"2/5 Very grainy and under mature. Lots of issues here: 1) they should not be making such a heavy distillate with pot stills if they aren’t going to age longer, 2) open fermenters in NYC climate creates consistency issues, 3) minimal aging using small casks creates a harsh, immature spirit, and 4) I’d include wheat or rye in the mashbill. Just corn and malted barley makes for a pretty one dimensional bourbon IMO. Really not a fan of this, particularly at the price point."

2.0,It's like that time when you see a college student hitting on an older woman at a wedding reception. He is well intentioned and has all the makings of a good choice but is just missing about 4-6 years.

2.0,"Not unpleasant, but ultimately a difficult bourbon to cheer for. There's a certain immaturity to the whisky that I found myself unable to get past, although the honeyed notes are welcome. The finish is smooth and clean, yet predictably short."
3.5,Straight up ✌🏼
3.5,"Straight Bourbon Batch 141: LOTS of American oak on the nose (I like American oak so I consider this a good thing), with some vanilla in there as well. Palate is nondescript grain, but with a pretty strong and tasty smoke/char note at the end. I don’t get the “youth” that others on here seem to, but I definitely agree with the one dimensional-ness. Overall, the flavor doesn’t quite deliver on what the nose seems to promise, but wow am I excited about what will come from this place."
