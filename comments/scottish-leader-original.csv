2.0,"The hunt for decent low cost scotch blend brought me to Scottish Leader. Deanston and Bunnahabhain are two of my favorite single malt distillers so hoping some quality made it into this cheap ($15 paid) blend. Poured neat, looks nice enough in the glass. Noses honey lemon cough drop similar to JW Black. Some light smoke, maltiness with some weight. Palate starts nice with smoky honey ,malt and some wood. Then the grain alcohol takes over with bitterness and the honey note turns to more of a corn syrup. Finish lasts but turns bitter and dry. Water helps it greatly losing the overly bitter notes and smoothing the grain bite as well as improving mouthfeel and finish. Not too bad for the $$.....72/100 blend score.....works ok as a mixer but I would not repurchase. I think the only real good blends are the age statement ones or vatted malts. Im sticking to bourbon in this price range"

2.75,"Vanilla, nutmeg, and grain on the nose leads to a palate of caramel, baking spice, toasted oak, and a spicy finish of licorice and wisps of smoke. Hot for 80 proof, definitely recommend a splash of water or an ice cube. At this price point, I think I prefer Grants, or Red Label for a few bucks more."
