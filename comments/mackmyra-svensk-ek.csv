4.0,"Good oak but the high sense of minerals makes it an obvious Swedish single malt. If you close your eyes, you can almost see the forrest. Something different and probably aquired taste."

2.0,"Thin mouthfeel. Light straw color. Light malt, apple and peach. Hot, even with water added. Not much depth of flavor."
3.0,"Starts a little sweet, then you get a lot of sort of raw oak, then a bit of burn/bite.  Not quite like licking a tongue depressor, but not very refined, either."

5.0,"Don’t usually rate to 5 stars for any whiskey, but for this... it is more than deserving. This whiskey isn’t remarkably different from say, any highland scotch whiskey, but it is almost as if Mackmyra took the single 
best trait of every highland scotch and incorporated it into their recipe. This one spoke to me. Not daring, not even bold. Just damn good whiskey not pretending to be anything else."
3.0,Smells a lot like bubblegum

4.25,"Not sure if this is the right Mackmyra; the bar had a hand selected cask and I couldn't get the label. 

Bourbon nose with oak, honey, and cinnamon. Oily palette with barrell spice and wood tannin. Just yummy"

3.0,"Au nez, on retrouve la pomme du Brukswhisky mais plus sucré, comme de la pomme cuite.
En bouche, c'est léger aussi, mais avec davantage de caractère et des arômes d'agrumes. C'est encore trop vert pour moi mais mieux que le Bruks.
La finale est agréable, sur la langue, avec des arômes d'orange sanguine.
Un whisky léger mais sympa."

3.0,Light and grassy on the nose with a sweet corn profile. The palate is bright and oily with hints of coastal seawater and moss. A warm and oily body that lacks complexity. Baked spices round out the taste for a heated finish.

3.0,"'16 Advent Calendar.oakey, salty, woody - very unique flavors."
4.0,"One of the most exciting realities in the world of whisky these days is the drive toward deepening the connection between place and spirit...the terroir of whisky, if you will. The Svensk Ek from Mackmyra is a great example of this, with locally sourced grains aged, mostly, in Swedish oak. The Swedish oak lends a unique profile to the dram; the nose has a perfumed quality to it, with allspice and sandalwood alongside vanilla and a grapey note. The palate comes loaded with juicy ripe fruit (especially stone fruit), a bit of vanilla, spice, a little salt, and a woody note. I couldn't help but think that this is what an Old Pulteney NAS might taste like, to a degree. This would be a slam dunk if it didn't taste so young; it's just a little too rough around the edges yet. That said, it's a delicious promise of good things to come with some extra maturation...and still pretty enjoyable to drink as is."
3.0,Very flat and woody. Peach and green apple on the pallet. Quite grainy and not very malty. Interesting tipple.

Quite similar to scotch whisky's highland style but distinctively different."

3.75,"Nose: Juicy, sweet apple tart with marzipan. Coffee with milk. Touch of dark chocholate. Rosted nuts. Vanilla. 

Palate: More roasted nuts and marzipan. Spicy and sweet coffee, but with a light fruity touch as well - which goes well with it. 

Finish: Medium long. Sweet and woody, yet fruty. After a while it tirns into milk chocholate (very faint). 

Overall: Liquid apfelstrudel with coffee! Really nice. Mackmyra’s (green) fruity, spirit goes very well with the active parts of the casks used. Solid 3.75 - just a stronger finish from being really great."
3.5,"Color: Light amber. 

Smell: A very distinct oak smell to it and a bit of sweetness. 

Taste: Oak and maybe some herbs. 

Aftertaste: Warm and dry, the oaky taste stays for quite a while."
