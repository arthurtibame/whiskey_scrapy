2.5,Beautiful fruit nose. Such luscious French spices. But where is the grain? There is beautiful organic single malt in this ten year old whiskey. But I can’t taste it. Coming off that big nose it’s thin and lacks the chewy malt I am looking for.
2.75,Little spicy. Better taste than smell but don’t love.  A bit fruity/sweet too.
