3.75,Unexpected tastes. Dried fruit on the nose. Some petroleum notes. Sweetness.
3.75,"Note: toasty, rye, apricot, sherry again has a sake like nose
Body: light-medium (nice)
Palate: malty, bready, vanilla
Finish: medium
Note: this one is really good."
3.0,"Nose has some spice I can't put my finger on, honey, and light oak.  

Taste has a touch of smoke, maybe a splash of salt, savory meats, honey.  

The finish is toasted oak with hints of vanilla and some kinda of rich savory desert.  

Not bad for a fake Japanese whisky.  I got this on sale for $75 which was about 200 off of the MSRP of about 275 retail.  At 75 buy all you can.  At over 150, this is a pass."
4.0,So rich and complex that I feel like drinking a different whisky every time
4.5,"Lemon, spirit, and floreal al The nose.
White pepper, toffee, salt, honey and wood at palate. Elegant, sweet long finish. Nice"

4.0,"WhiskyLive NJ.  After the Balcones Rye and Amrut Intermediate Sherry, this was probably my third favorite.  Blend if Scottish and Japanese.  Can’t recall exact tasting notes, but was good enough to make my top 5 for the night."

4.5,"Best Kurayoshi i have tasted so far (i have tasted 3) and i believe all its flavor comes from the higher abv. This scottish and japanese blended malt made me have a good time, and i really enjoyed it. 

Bottled at 50% abv.

On the nose, it is beautiful. Very Floral, Perfumed.
Dried fruits and Grapes  No alcohol note whatsoever even for a 50%abv. 
Strawberries, sweet bread; Fantastic.
Grape juice, Cereal, Honeycomb, Bananas and that ""typical"" dulce de leche, toffee note from the other Kurayoshi. 

On the palate, also very good. Almonds.
Nutty. Butterscotch.Pepper and Citric notes. More dulce de leche (toffee)
After the third sip it becomes earthy.

Aftertaste is the best part by far. Perfect score. So rewarding. A super pleasant spice bomb, a mixture of pepper, ginger and oak spice.

Overall, i got to say that there are better 18yo whiskies out there but this one deserves to be tasted at least once. Great whisky, only Kurayoshi i would recommend, 92 over 100. Kanpai!"

4.25,Very floral and vanillary on the nose. Citrus-orange with the ever so slight smokiness of black tea on the palate. More vanilla and smoke in the finish.
