2.25,"The nose is quite typical of scotch with malted grain and some floral honeyed fruit, though there's quite a bit of meatiness that borders on smelling like sulfur. There's a fair amount going on on the nose, but it's fairly out of whack with a prominent smell of stinky feet covering up the nice traditional highland notes. The palate is a bit harsh with a questionable balance, but it's better than the nose. There isn't a ton going on on the palate though and the finish is weak. That stinky feet smell comes through as hot dog water. There's aren't any notes here that are good, though the floral bits and hit of lemon zest are OK. The rest is decidedly sub-par. There are some sea-spray flavors that come out more on the palate than on the nose. The complexity really isn't there either. There actually isn't a ton of the grain coming through either. It's just a very traditional scotch profile, but not a very good one. It's kind of drinkable, but really isn't enjoyable. I might be convinced that this is a bad 12 year old, but it doesn't taste older than 10, and really it tastes even younger than that. There's enough sweetness to carry it, but it's quite a bland sweetness. There's some spice, but it doesn't have much particular character (maybe white pepper?). Like Glenmorangie The Original, this has serious flaws, but I can't bring myself to hate it. It's not as good as Glenmorangie The Original, but it's acceptable perhaps. There's a nice bit of toastiness with even a hint of peanut coming through on the finish. It has that sweet, light flavor with fruit and vanilla that's characteristic of bourbon barrel aged scotch, along with a hit of cinnamon bringing up the spice and some smoke. It's hard to justify better than a 12 or worse than an 8 for this. That's a pretty broad range, but I think 9 to 11 is the most likely.
Second tasting. The nose is stronger with more going on that that of Arran 10, but the balance is off with clear sulfur (though nothing like Clan MacGregor levels). There's quite a bit of cherry on the nose, somewhat like a moderately young brandy, perhaps a la Symbole National, though not as rich (though still somewhat similar). The palate is fruity and the sulfur isn't too bad. There's some stuff going on here for sure and it's moderately rich. It's more rich and complex than the 10 is, though not by an incredible amount. It isn't very interesting, but it does have some of that apricot in it a bit that's very appealing. For a fairly cheap Scotch, this really isn't a bad choice. I'm upping it to at least a 12. Ooh, the long finish does have some sulfur, so I don't think I can go above a 12."

3.0,"Definitely a young whisky, light. Agree with notes. There is a definite burn to it. Liked it a lot and good for the right occasion. Definite spice to it."
4.0,"1/17/18
Nose: Incredibly sweet, caramel and brown sugar, mild smoke, lightly floral.
Palate: Sweet at beginning, transitioning to savory. Starts caramel, then transitions 
 to mushrooms. Medium finish of peaty, earthy smoke."

5.0,"Fresh bourbon on the nose, fresh wood sap and wood shavings. Kiwis, lime, lemon peels. Honey melon. Tropical, yellow fruits, pineapple - hint of mango. Gooseberries. Rhubarb and green ferns. Sugary sweet. Vanilla pods. Thick yogurt note. Icing sugar. Anise.
Pears on the palate.
Oloroso.

Altogether very woody and aromatic, very fresh and citrus y, very green, and certainly very delicious.
Reminds me very much of a Dailuaine.

A more than pleasant surprise.

Happy Burns' Night!"

3.75 due to low price, otherwise it would be 3.5 for me."

4.0,"Proof you don't have to spend a lot of money for a good scotch whisky, what this expression lacks in sophistication it more than makes up in balance. The toasted barley, honey and cinnamon play nice, with a smooth finish you keep drinking considering it's only $50 CAD."

3.0,"Would give it 3.5 stars if I could. For a bourbon aged whisky it certainly doesn't have the overly-corn-sweet nose of some American oaked scotches, but conversely, for a sherry finished scotch the colour is extrmely light - almost clear and off-putting until you have a sip and can imagine something much more caramel-coloured. Not disappointed, but for the price (which was more than a good value at $65 CAD) I'd buy a Glendronach or something similar first. A definite ""try it"" nonetheless."
