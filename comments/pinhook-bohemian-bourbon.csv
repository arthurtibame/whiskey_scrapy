4.5,"Lemon pound cake, Corn dust, slight oak on the nose, Orange Marmalade, corn, vanilla on the palate."
3.5,"A bit young with earthy piney grassy notes, but turns into sweet brown sugar and a rye finish."
2.25,"So how much latitude should we give a Whiskey that shows ""potential""? Layer into that a Bourbon that is the innagural release from what was the Old Taylor Distillery and is now known as Castle and Key. It's a fairly limited release with around 15k bottles available nationwide (for reference last year's George T Stagg had 28k bottles available). As you ponder this question let's look at the specs for this release:

Mashbill: 75% Corn, 15% Malted Barley and 10% Rye
Age: 34 months
Filtration: Unfiltered
Proof: 114.5
SRP: $50 (average price is closer to $60)

So how does it taste? Let's dive in...

Upon entry it's fairly light and surprisingly easy to drink. On the palate you are hit with ripe mandarin oranges and tangerines interlaced with cinnamon. Mid palate adds lemon zest, vanilla and some brown sugar. Finish is a medium length and with some overpowering young oak. It falls apart a bit on the finish. 

So now back to the original question, should we pay $50+ for what is clearly a Bourbon not yet ready for prime time. Does it show ""potential""? Sure, the citrus notes along with spice and classic Bourbon notes makes for a potentially tasty combination, however, right now it's disjointed and suffers from the bitter oak and dominant cinnamon due to its youth. For me it's a pass for the bottle but I think in a few years (assuming they allow the base age to grow) it will be good. At that point however will they expect $80+ a bottle? 
Also take into consideration New Riff and Wilderness Trail waited to have there products age for 4 years, are cheaper and better across the board. So really the age and new Distillery play doesn't fly here for me. 

It's a pass for me but I am sure plenty will buy into due to the history around the Distillery! Cheers All!"

3.5,"(34 months age statement, first bourbon release from Castle & Key Distillery for Pinhook) Rich and spicy. The nose is very bright and inviting while the taste is full with a medium length finish. A classic bourbon with a youthful approach. Very nice!"
