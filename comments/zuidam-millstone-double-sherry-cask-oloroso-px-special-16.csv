1.0,"Tried it neat. 

Nose: Salty caramel and toffee with an hint of cherry
Taste: alcohol, acidic with a bit of tangerine. Bitter on the side of the tongue. 
Finish: liquorice (but more the Southern European style)

...a bit better after adding a few drops of water. Now it smells of glue (shoe shop) but the taste is a bit softer and slightly floral

Good that I just bought the 30ml sampler. ...will not finish it."
