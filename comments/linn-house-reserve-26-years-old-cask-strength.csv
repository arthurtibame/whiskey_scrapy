4.25,"My last review on ""impressive whiskies i had in Scotland"" and actually my last review on any whisky i had there, i have left this marvelous collectors item, The Linn House Reserve. What is it you say? Well, this is a bottle you can only get if you are invited to Linn House, the Chivas Regal Castle in speyside. This is not for sale, they will give it to you as a gift, and i had the honor to get it signed by the master himself, Colin Scott, Chivas Regal Master Blender. 

Linn House is a House/Castle that Chivas bought in the late 1800s, and it has been remodeled to receive guests (brand ambassadors) from all over the world. 

Bottled at 52%abv,

On the Nose: absolutely citric. A classic speysider here: Orange and Lemon. Orange Zest, lemon peel. Super fresh. Maybe a little dim on the nose.

On the palate: very Fruity, orange is the main note, the freshly cut oranges you often get from a Chivas 18 or a Ballantine's 30. Ginger and Chocolate. Amazing.

Aftertaste is wonderful. Tobacco and dry grass, very pleasant. 

Overall this is a jewel for a guy like me. I am so proud of it, but i can't lie in my ratings, and even if the Palate and Aftertaste were superb, the nose was a little dim. 88 over 100, that is the proper score for it. Sláinte!!"
