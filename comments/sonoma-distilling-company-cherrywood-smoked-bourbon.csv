2.5,"Cherrywood and smoke is a little overwhelming. I’ve heard non-bourbon drinkers describe bourbon as taking a bite out of a wooden shelf. They might have an argument with this one. But, if you like the cherrywood and smoke, this one might be just right."
4.0,Very interesting flavor yet smooth and pleasing. The cherrywood is certainly noticeable and a nice change.
