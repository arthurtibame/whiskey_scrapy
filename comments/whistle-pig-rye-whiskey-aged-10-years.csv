3.75,"Spicy, warm and a rich body. Lots of wood and hot alcoholic flavor. Alcohol burn is unique to anything I have tasted yet and I’m not sure if I like it or not. That burn contributes to my 3.75 and not above 4 star rating. Will definitely come back to this and enjoy it, perhaps to the point of changing my rating."

4.0,Heavy alcohol aroma with vanilla /caramel undertones. Starts smooth then gets sweet with toffee and caramel finishes slightly harsh with a definite Rye  back taste that gets right in the gills.

4.5,"I’ll preface this with saying that I’m a big whistle pig fan. I’ve had several from unique barrels, but this standard rye is one I always want on my shelf. You can smell the rye warmth. The heat is not overbearing and mostly comes on late. I get clear flavors of s’mores and coffee. Undertones of vanilla and caramel throughout with a wonderful aftertaste!"
