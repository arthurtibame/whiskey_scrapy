1.0,Way to young. Could not get paste the aroma of it.   Could taste metal in every sip.  Couldn't  even make a decent Manhattan with it.  Everyone I made a drink with it never finished it. Cool bottle. But that's about all I can say it had going for it.  Try it in a bar before buying a bottle.

4.0,Anafirst I really did not like this. I was so mad that I spent money on such a crappy whiskey. As time went on I really began to enjoy it in an Old Fashioned.  I still didn't like it neat or on the rocks but in an Old Fashioned it gave it a very unique tasty flavor
3.0,"Strange. Floral and herby to the point that I had a sudden craving for the Amaro Dell'Erborista afterwards. Definitely not a starter rye, and not what I look for in a whiskey."

4.0,"Very pleasant and quite different rye. With the 100% Rye mash this really stands out when nosing, tasting, and on the finish. Imagine fresh rye bread, cinnamon, pepper, raisin/prune sweetness, clove, wood. Also get some tobacco notes as well...perique like notes. Incredibly long, thick legs in the glass. You get the woody, tobacco notes first then a sweet, delicious smooth and soothing burn in the finish...Albieit it's a bit short. Happy with my purchase and even better that they now bottle this juice in the 750ml for a couple of bucks more than the 375ml."

3.0,The spices didn't come out as I had hope but it's there coupled with the maple savoury sweetness.

3.0,"Day 9. Rye day. There are a few Rye's that I love (in fact the first whisky I liked was a Rye...local distillery, not available anywhere else and expensive as hell), but most of them are not really my cup of tea. On the nose you get a lot of spices, oak, rye, and for some weird reason, basil. Interesting, haven't had that smell anywhere else so far. The initial taste is bitter, sharp, and not very enjoyable. Then you get hit by the one main note: dark bitter chocolate...hot chocolate. That one note is almost worth buying this one. It literally feels like drinking molten 99% cocoa chocolate with a drop of milk. Awesome. No sweetness whatsoever. Unfortunately, it's the only note besides bitter spices. Rather one dimensional, even if that one dimension is nice. There is no real aftertaste to speak of, just a bit of heat and spice that's staying for a couple seconds. All in all, I'm glad I tried this one because it had some interesting notes in the smell and in the taste, but it's not something I'd pour to just enjoy a glass. Also, price/performance ratio doesn't work out."

2.75,"This was the single barrel, which I did not see listed on the site. Anyway, this is an interesting one. It has a unique flavor profile compared to other ryes I've tried in the past. Honey and maple on the nose. Brown sugar and iced tea on the palate. Not a particularly memorable finish. Overall, it's decent. 3 stars, and that may be considered a bit generous. It's not objectively bad, just not for me. Still better than their bourbon, which I found to be highly disappointing. At this point, I think I'll stay away from Hudson in the future."
