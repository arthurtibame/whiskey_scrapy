4.5,"Woahoo....this was my favourite Adelphi beating out 25 yr Mortlach and Bowmores. Now it was end of day 2 Dramfest 40 drams in so who knows how it would rate in the cold light of day but man it made an impression. 

Adelphi are known for their px sherry finished whisky and this one from Tomatin, was first-fill ex-Pedro Ximenez sherry butt...what a cracker!"
