3.0,Was impressed on first tasting and less so on the second.  Will need to have a third to break the tie.  Had more of an oily feel to it like Breckinridge.

5.0,9/17 Red Rabbit w Alana.  Liked it very much.  Aging gives it an extra rounded dimension.

4.0,Very smooth. A bit of bite in the middle of ingesting. Caramel notes. A bit of apple. Very good. Nice compliment to the collection. Cousin to EC.

5.0,One of the better medium priced bourbons for general neat pours. Love the sweetness of the bourbon. Smooth on the pallet and the chew and finish is vanilla like.
4.0,Vanilla and spices
3.75,Similar in nose and taste to Eagle Rare. Excellent bourbon at a slightly higher cost.

3.5,"It's got the barrel age taste, but because the char on the barrels is #2, you get more grain taste than wood."

3.0,Nice if unspectacular.  Too much cinnamon for me though countered by fruit aspects.
