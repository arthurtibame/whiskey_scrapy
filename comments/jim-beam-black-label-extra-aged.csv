3.0,"I'm not exactly torn-up about the loss of the 8-year age statement on Jim Beam Black, because Jim Beam Black sold in Canada never actually had an 8-year age statement (international Beam Black was a 6-year-old). Regardless, its replacement is . . . sorta meh. Nice enough smell of caramel, vanilla and (fairly subtle) nutty Beam funk. Maybe some tobacco and stone fruits. But the taste is a bit thin, and leads with tobacco and Beam funk. A bit of peach, maybe. Candy corn. Lightly dry, toasty wood finish. An unremarkable bourbon, though the price is right. Beam Black is like every entry in the Beam Small Batch collection, if every entry in the Beam Small Batch collection was totally uninteresting and generic. It's Beam, it's bourbon, it's fine; the price is good ($28 in Canada on the right day, which is approaching bottom-shelf territory)--but for the same money, you'll have to pry Evan Williams Black Label out of my cold, dead hands."

3.0,"Wood,wood. and wood on the nose. Some mustiness, nuts, and vanilla as well. Surprisingly smooth on the tongue. Hints of walnuts and some dark chocolate. You definitely get the standard Beam black cherry walnut cocktail. Not sure this actually is the highest rated bourbon in the world (ISWC 2016), but this has a lot of bang for the buck. Jim Beam Bonded is better, but this is more amenable to session sipping. 6/8/17"

3.0,"So, I grabbed a bottle of this about a week ago based on some above average reviews from people who’s reviews I trust.  Basically, I was looking for a reason to replace my standard mixer which is Jim Beam White Label.  This used to be called Double Aged and came in at 8 years old.  Well, I guess that was too long for the cash grabbers at Beam Suntory so they dropped the Double aged moniker and probably shortened the aging by 2-3 years and renamed it “Extra Aged”.  To quote Jurassic Park: “Clever, girl.”

As it is, the nose is typical Beam with candied corn, sweet toffee and faint vanilla.  The palate follows suit but adds a bit of oak spices while remaining slightly smoother than regular Beam.  The finish is a bit more warm than the regular white label and is medium in length- it’s still a bit too sweet.  I just wish the extra ABV and aging lead to something more noticeable on the palate.  It’s still relatively cheap (I paid $23 here on the shelves in Virginia- and while I think it mixes equally with the standard white label, I think if I’m going to switch up the ingredients in my B&C’s I’d do better by going with the Beam Bonded.  The 100 proof really adds a kick to my mixer for the exact same price.  

I don’t see myself switching brands here- I’ve been a Beam drinker since I was an infant (Mom said a little Beam on my pacifier always soothed the angry beast, lol).  3.5 stars.  Happy mixing, my friends."

3.0,"A great introduction to the world of bourbon, even for a whiskey beginner. It is quite smooth for its price. You should drink it neat. But for me I usually water it down for my everyday drinks, bcs the abv is quite high for me, so I can open the flavor. 

Nosing and palate is very bourbon-y. Sweet, smooth, oak taste.
Go buy this if youre confused about which bourbon / whisky to buy"
4.0,"I grabbed a bottle of this bourbon a couple of weeks ago and have been making my way through it pretty quickly (I shared most of it with family). Here’s what I’ve found. 

Bottled at 43% ABV and most likely chill filtered. It’s a Kentucky straight bourbon so it’s natural color by law. This is a straight amber. It’s a NAS that formally had an age statement of 8 years. My guess is that it’s somewhere between 6-8. Not a bad price at $23. 

The nose is strong on the corn. Plenty of oak, vanilla, cinnamon and clove. Buttery rolls, orange zest and some milk chocolate. Toffee and butterscotch, baked apples, a bit of banana and almonds. It’s a very nice nose especially considering the price. Nothing really remarkable, but nothing bad either. 

The palate is more of the same with corn leading the charge. Caramel, vanilla, oak and a touch of mint. Stronger banana than on the nose and walnuts instead of almonds or maybe both. Very easy drinking and inoffensive. 

A light bodied mouthfeel that is a little thin but a little oily too. 
A medium short finish with oak, banana, walnuts and corn. 

For the price this is a solid choice. More expensive than Evan Williams Black Label ($16), but much better quality. Definitely good enough to drink neat or with a little ice, and almost too good to drown in a mixed drink. I still need to try EW White Label (which is still cheaper than this one [$18]) to compare, but this might become my go to house bourbon. A solid 3.75 factoring in the value, but could be bumped up to a 4 depending on how many I’ve had lol. 
Cheers"

2.0,"My home bar was in dire need of a cheap mixer so I snagged up a bottle of this for $24 in DC (came with 2 tumblers, too!). As someone with limited experience with Beam over the past decade. I figured the abv and spice (according to distiller) would do nicely in an old-fashioned cocktail and maybe even enjoyable neat. 

The nose is heavy on sweet corn, caramel and punch of vanilla which for me triggered the feeling I’d struck bargain basement gold, but sadly it’s downhill after that. A thin and pedestrian mouth awaited and is bookended with a quick, hot, oaky spice but ultimately flat, blah finish.

As far as being a mixer goes, so far so goodish, but I feel a ping of regret for not just getting Turkey 101 as planned. Alas, my rabid search for a bottom shelf but respectable utility mixer continues. Free glasses though! ;)

3.0,"Nose: The nose on first approach has strong notes of oak, some corn, and smoke lingers about as well; but overall nothing too exciting.

Taste: Once again oak is on the palate with notes of corn. It has a slight burn going down that leaves a tingling mouthfeel behind and the finish has notes of mint. Just FYI adding a little water makes this whiskey more friendly and removes that burn and adds a nutty flavor too.

Opinion: This is Jim Beam's extra aged bourbon. Usually I associate more time in the barrel with better quality whiskeys. However, in this particular instance, though I do enjoy this bourbon, I am not as impressed as I thought I would be. In my humble opinion I may actually prefer Jim Beam's White Label to this dram. Adding a splash of water did help me to enjoy it more, but though this was a fine dram, it wasn't my personal favorite. Sláinte!"

3.5,"Jim Beam Extra Aged is yet another bourbon that lost its age statement (was 8 years) in recent times, an unfortunate trend in the bourbon world right now.  So where does this Beam Black fit in with existing Beam expressions?  Let's find out!

Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn, no added water.  On the nose, a nice lightly sweet caramel with a bit of vanilla frosting and an oaky backdrop.

On the palate, somewhat thin mouthfeel, starts lightly sweet but quickly changes over to a bitter tart.  More caramel and vanilla with a bit deeper character than you expect from the lower end Beams, and accented by a bit more oaky char than usual also.  Very smooth, with just a little spice and heat. At times I seem to detect a light fruity note but it's not dominate by any means.  Probably a good place to start for beginners in the bourbon world or those looking for a nice smooth sip to ease into a session.  

Finish is somewhat long actually, producing lingering vanilla, some honey, and nice oaky smoky char. The enhanced smoky char is the best part of the sip for me.

Overall, a fairly basic Beam bourbon but the extra aging, as is typical of longer aged bourbon, produces a bit more character and depth of flavor.  I'd put the Black certainly well above White label and Repeal Batch and on par with Double Oak, but a bit below Devil's Cut (stronger oaky character I prefer), Bonded (stronger Beam peanut funk), and well below Distiller's Cut (just delicious and best Beam expression for the $).  So Black falls about mid pack in the Beam bourbon portfolio for me.  It's far from bad, just not their very best either.  It's a classic bourbon profile really, with caramel, vanilla, and smokiness in spades, but not a whole lot more.  It lacks complexity and enhanced spicy fruity or floral notes, but is super smooth and easy to pick apart the classic bourbon profile.  I feel like the 43% ABV is hurting this one a bit.  Kicked up to 47-50% I think would really bring out the bit of extra aging and take the flavors up a notch.   Not bad, but go for Distiller's Cut if budget allows, as it offers so much more feel, flavor, and kick.  Cheers!"

This is a weak bourbon. It tastes like very watery Single Barrel even though the difference in proof from 95 to 86 may not seem that significant. Everything is muted here, I barely smell anything unless I swirl it up. I still get that peanut brittle flavor but again, more muted than Single Barrel. This is easy to sip don't get me wrong, but at $27 you can buy plenty of other easy-sipping bourbons at the same price or less.

The vanilla and caramel continue into the palate with a sip that is sweet with a consistency that is just thin enough to be called thin and with just enough oil to keep it from being dry. Towards the back, charred oak, pepper, and cinnamon lead to a finish where the vanilla, caramel, and oak linger for a shorter than expected time. It's got all of the classic bourbon flavors and feelings but not in a way I'll remember or crave. Excellent quality for the price and a very good introductory or well bourbon for your home bar. I would say it's something to keep on hand as it is well rounded and will be an excellent first choice for cocktails and a decent sipper, if there is nothing better on hand."

3.0,"On the nose, you get lighter notes of vanilla and corn with much louder notes of caramel and peanuts. The nose also has a sugar caned oak note. The sweetness really does pop out the glass. The palate is thin and not as sweet as I expected, with continuing notes of caramel and peanut, and with a much stronger taste compared to the nose of vanilla along with a hint of cherry. The finish is very short and does not have any distinct lingering note other than ""generic bourbon flavor"". This is a definite improvement to Jim Beam's white label if the prices are comparable in your area."

2.0,On the nose it’s sweet with a classic Jim Beam smell. On the palate there is some spice that starts to bring heat as you move to the finish. The finish starts spicy but fades quickly leaving corn. It’s okay neat but is better in an old fashion.

2.0,"A little light on the mouthfeel, but the finish is where all the flavor is. Huge oak notes. The rest is vanilla, and maybe some allspice.

Nothing special. Would like to taste side by side with Evan Williams Black.

Edit: As it cools with 1 small ice cube this gets weirdly sweet. Too sweet. Dropped to 2 stars from 3."

4.0,"Besides this family having more hands in Bourbon than Jeff Bezos does my life this deserves all the awards it's gotten.

Vanilla and Spices come forward with light corn towards the end. Corn and leather with a sweet vanilla come together, a slight burn towards the back quickly fades into a clean/smooth medium length finish. Hints of vanilla and carmel and grain linger. 

Would use in Cocktails for the price but the balance of this most definitely deserve a heavy lean toward straight or with light ice/water to open it up. Don't think this is just another whiskey. It's not."

3.0,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 3:

I’m trying this side by side with OG Jim Beam. For Science.

The color of this is a bit darker than OG, but BARELY. A very Beamy nose, and for my money, stronger than standard. But it’s the same familiar scents: banana, leather, but of brine.

Body packs a punch. Makes OG seem mild, which is funny since OG makes the repeal batch taste mild. I’d bet this drink would make the repeal batch taste like water. While OG and RB had very similar flavor profiles, this body has a bit more. Heavy leather and nutty flavors. Some sugar and brine too. I get zero banana, which kind of blows my mind. Compared to OG, the body does not taste like a different degree of the same thing. These are very different beasts.

Finish on this is heavy on cinnamon and peppercorn. Very bitter in mouth feel too, probably from the brine. Where OG Beam finishes relatively quickly, (albeit with similar flavors and mouth feel), this little guy drags on with spice and buzz.

I don’t care for the Beam family of products so far, but of original, repeal batch, and this one, I prefer this one. Not as friendly for entry level bourboners, but far more interesting.

I don’t know if I actually have 28 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."

3.5,"During this Great Hiatus, I have been treating myself (mostly) to mid-and-high end Bourbons – the Woodfords, Elijah Craigs, High West’s, and so forth. But today I noticed a neglected bottle of Jim Beam Black Label Extra Aged Bourbon at the back of the bar, and I decided to give it a shot. What a pleasant experience.The nose has an affect of milk chocolate and gasoline (I mean this, I think, as a good thing), and I was delightfully surprised with the taste: Smooth yet with a nice little attitude, with elements of caramel, pear, and to a lesser degree toffee and black cherry. It goes down creamy, then gets a little snarky as it hits the back of the mouth, and there is a very slightly numbing/Novocain aftertaste, but nothing unpleasant. Now, fifteen or thirty seconds later, there’s a bit of an harsh scratch at the top of the throat, but it’s only there if you gulp too big, or if you are looking for it. Really, this is a pleasant surprise, and a good thing to reach for when you don’t feel like over-thinking your choices or dealing with the often multi-layered, more complex experiences of pricier bourbon."

4.5,"I hated Jim Beam. White label and apple were very low rated whiskies, but this one... this one is a Marvel. It changed my whole perspective of the brand. An instant favorite.

When i tasted it i wanted to score it with lower points because i am not a fan of the brand, but this was so good that i gave it the true score.

On the nose, fantastic: cola, grapes, a dim spicyness, perfumed vanilla. Letting it sit for a couple minutes will release banana aromas, caramel, banana split, banana ice cream, and wood smoke like a fireplace. Simply outstanding.

On the palate two notes, but beautifully crafted: banana and cinnamon. Finish is long, creamy and spicy. 

I really enjoyed it, i have read good reviews everywhere before tasting it and it did not dissapointed me. I rate this baby a nice 92 over 100 and i absolutely recommend it. Cheers!"

3.5,"Nose: Dusty corn, caramel, a little vanilla, and oak.  Alcohol is present, though not crazy.  Bready, with a bit of rye spice coming in, with almost some mint and basil/thyme.  Maraschino cherries - the cheap kind.  Bananas, peanuts.

Palate: Exactly as expected - retains the same core notes as the nose, though the vanilla is a little more pronounced.  Not sickly sweet, but close.  Nuts, small hit of tobacco and leather.  Hershey process chocolate.  Black pepper, oak, touch of char.  Fruit cup.  Medium light mouthfeel.

Finish: Oak comes way to the front, turning the experience more dry.  Flash of texture on the tongue, then nuts, fruits, and rye spice reveal while the oak subsides.  Finish is medium short.

Other Notes: I'll take this over standard Beam white label any day - far more refined, though not necessarily the most complex thing, either.  Still, a good ""background whiskey"" if you're looking for a no-frills sip that won't break the bank."
