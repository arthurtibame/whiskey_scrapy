5.0,"Subtle smoke and peat on the nose.  Very refined.  Reminds me of being next to a fire in a small pub on a cold night on Islay.  Sherry, oak, a whisp of smoke on the palate.  A little spicey, but not too hot.  Finish is long and pleasant with smoke in the background.  This is a real class act.  Debatably one of the best Islay whiskeys I’ve had."
