4.0,One of my new favorites. Smooth as butter with a little spice to the end.

4.0,"If you like Wathens (8 year old - Singke Barrel).  You should love this.  

It comes from the same sources.

The new 10 year old is fantastic too."

3.25,Traditional bourbon nose and palate with a little bit of oak and rye spice. Finish is a little dry and quick. Not bad but nothing unique especially at its price point.

3.5,Little bit of rye but I definitely like it for an unknown...to me at least.
3.5,Some honey and oak with spice in the finish. Slightly oily mouthfeel.

3.0,"Decent bourbon, smooth with the oak expected of a 12 year, but overpriced."
3.75,"Smooth off the bat, barely a the remotest hint of a kick, actually not even, a smooth finish to mock the opening"
3.25,Some rye spiciness over light oak. Tends to be overpriced.

4.0,This is for Tim. Representing the D while on the road. 2/22/17.
3.25,"Fruit and acetone but not unpleasant on the nose, fruity with hints of vanilla and a long fruity alcohol finish"
5.0,I love this one. You taste the vanilla and caramel then spice then it disappears and you’re curious what you just tasted so you go in again and you find more complexity in the spice. Old fashioned ready - almost as tho an angostura bitter is already built into it.

3.0,I would easily give this 3 and a 1/2 stars if it let me. It has a great upfront buttery flavor my only complaint is that the finish which is reasonably long has too much alcohol flavor not a burn just the flavor.
