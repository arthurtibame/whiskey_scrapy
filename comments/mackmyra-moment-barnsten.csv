3.0,"!Review of Mackmyra Moment Mareld - placing it here! Despite being named after the phenomenon of bioluminescent plankton, the Mareld does not glow. It does smell of smoke and sweet liquorice, anise, flambeed pears and a bit of pine. Skål! The dram itself is strong and hearty, and warms the throat going down. Best Mackmyra I've had so far. Quite the iodine taste, smoke, white pepper and pine resin, but there is a new depth to it, probably from the sherry casks finishing. Speaking of finishes, this is peat and pine, and a bit of cumin, very sweedish."

4.0,"Drinks by the Dram sample:  This is an interesting whiskey.  If an Islay, Highlander, and a tropical Kavalan or Amrut decided to mix, this is the outcome.  On the nose, you get blueberries wth a wisp of 
    Smoke.  Taste is fruits grilled over charcoal.  Specifically, something of a cross between mangoes, pineapples, and berries.  But all steeped in red wine, and with just a hint of smoke.  Think sangria, with a side of grilled meats.  The finish is long with this lingering disappating heat.  I know you can't find this in the US, but if your travels take you abroad, it's a worthwhile and unique whiskey to bring back."
4.0,"The nose took a little while to open up, but five minutes after pouring, its full of sweet wine notes (reminiscent of the Jefferson Groth cask bourbon), toffee, candied orange peel, big fat, juicy, dark berries and I'm getting a touch of fresh mint – of all things – hovering around the top notes.

It's just shy of 50% so it's lovely and warming on the palate, the second sip is laced with juicy currants and almost a touch of cherry brandy. There's something almost sweet vermouth like about it - almost like 'essence of a manhattan'.

The finish is fairly snappy, but with feeling."
