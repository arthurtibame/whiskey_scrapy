3.0,"Nose is sweet and fruity, munch banana, reminds me of Pisang Ambon, but also notes of malt and fresh green leaves. Alcohol is quite sharp and almost burns the nostrils.
 Sweet on the tongue, again with banana notes, quite smooth, but still with an edge.
It's interesting but not quite up my alley, maybe for a dessert mixin?"

3.5,"My first sweddish whisky. Actually a very light, pleasant and very easy drinkable. 

Bottled at 41.2%abv, very light pale straw color.

On the nose, Grape, Plum, White wine, orange candy and carnival foam (really).

On the palate, it seems like a typical speyside scotch, just a very light pear juice. Finish is spicy/salty with ashy notes, aftertaste is the best part.

Overall this is a begginers, entry level whisky, i dont think it is expensive and it can be used as an everyday drink. My score for it is 78 over 100."

3.5,"Nose: Pears, pears, and green apples. Very fragrant, light and fresh. Deeper sniffs reveal cereal notes (cornflakes?). Some light toffee as well. Like this a lot. Like Old Pulteney 12 with the apple/pear notes on steroids.

Palate: Slightly thinner than I hoped for. You need to take larger sips to get the full body if the whisky. More pears and light vanilla. Some very well rounded spicyness (black pepper). No bitterness/woodyness. Very fresh, almost a white wine quality to it.

Finish: Pleasant but on the shorter side. No new notes emerges. 

Overall: I like this style of fresh whisky. It reminds me of OP12, but with even more pears/apples but with less funky notes (as can be sensed in most OP). I score it 3.5 on the back of the delicate fruity notes which are just lovely (it’s not far away from 3.75). A bit more taste and a stronger finnish and this would have been a really great one."
3.0,"Sweet, herbal and vanilla notes. A bit spicy. Collor: light yellow. Good whisky, but I think a little bit expansive."

3.0,"It's nice... But it's just another very subtle, sweet whisky with caramel notes, a lot of vanilla, it has it's own unique touch, with some herbs here and there and it's not very oily, more water like in texture (which I found oddly pleasant).  I think I want to give Mackmyra Svensk Rök next."

4.0,"Brukswhisky is roughly translated ""useable whisky"", and that's exactly what it is. The ambition of this whisky is printed on the table, so don't expect a challenge, innovation or out-of-this-world experiences. It's a well balanced, easy to understand and nicely finished whisky build on the single malt concept. Good harmony beetween taste, quality and the rather low price range. Had it been more expensive, I wouldn't give it four, but I pay respect to the Mackmyra ambition of this bottle"

3.0,"The nose is eerily reminiscent of a Jack Daniels, with subtle touches of banana , vanilla and oak - quite bourbonesque. There's a hint of pears and cinnamon to the palate. The finish is where the experience disappoints, with a discordant bitterness that lingers a little longer than you wish it to. It's alright."

3.5,"Nose bananas on the first hit but as it breathes pears and green apples.

The palate is light and fresh with pear drops but a dash of pepper to spice things up

The finish is medium with some new wood and a continued pepper

Overall a very light and enjoyable dram"

1.0,"Nez très vert sur la pomme et la poire.
En bouche, c'est sec mais vraiment léger. Peu d'arômes hormis le vert, l'alcool jeune.
La finale est aussi très légère sur la réglisse.
Vraiment pas mon style de whisky."
