5.0,"Way too good for the price. Ashy smoke like Laphroaig with violets and heather with some iodine. But the mouthfeel is more oily and honeyed like Ardbeg. There’s also a lovely fresh herbal and minty peat aspect to it like Kilchoman. Perfectly balanced sweet salty smoky and oily profile, with little to no grit or heat. Well done!!"

3.0,"Peaty, and slightly nutty. Very unique with a decent amount of character but friendly. Easy Islay to drink, but not the one I'd recommend. Bowmore still holds that title."

4.0,"Nose: musky brine and salty meat smoke following it. Also tart baked apples and apricot from sherry.

Palate: initially light in body, but the finish feels more thick and oily. Fruity notes and sweet tea at first. Then it gets more citrus and briny smoked meat, not unlike a mixture of Ardbeg and Lagavulin."
4.0,"I like the concept if blending whiskies to reach the taste of old closed lost distilleries.

This one was an illegal distillery in Islay and the taste reminds me of Bunnahabhain or Kilchoman. Peated briny floral sweet. Everything is fine"

4.25,Fairly standard peat and smoke on the nose. Medium peat on the palate. Long lingering finish with some sweetness and dark fruits in there. I wish it was slightly higher proof.

3.0,Good midrange whisky. On a smokey side. I find a bit rough on edges and lack of complexity. Not a bad drum but not for me

3.0,"The Bottle: The Lost Distillery Company does a really good job with their packaging. The bottles are all black frosted glass with lovely, stamp-like labels. There's a wealth of information on the label that provides details on the recreation in question. 
Specifically for this, the Lossit distillery from Islay wich oerationed from 1817 to 1867. 

In the Glass: Light straw.

On the Nose: Medicinal peat, wet rocks and brine. There is a definite marine quality to this, but with very little sweetness. It reads like a younger cousin to Laphroaig (and I would be amazed if there wasn't any of that in here).

Taste: This is on the younger side of things, but not to its detriment. The nose continues through the palatte, but there is a pronounced dried fruit sweetness on the finish that turns bitter after a few sips. Let it open up for at least 15 minutes and the bitterness gets tamped down with more sweetness. 
It's a solid autumn sipper. 

This is a simple, fairly-well integrated dram. It was priced right around Johnny Walker Black mark, and I do prefer it to that; but I think that I'd rather spend the extra few dollars and go with the Laphroaig 10. The Lossit reminds me so heavily of Laphroaig's flagship that I can't help but compare the two.

I can totally see where others would prefer the Lossit to the Laphroaig, since this is a bit softer and less medicinal; but for those who enjoy that facet of Islay, there is no substitute.

The goal is to produce a modern interpretation of what this distillrey would be producing if it were still in business today. Now this is very intriguing, if not a bit safe (since there's no way to actually know what would have been). 
Still, that-being-said, the team at The Lost Distillery Company does an admirable job across the range. I really enjoy the perspective that they bring to the table for things that we'd honestly never be able to try.
I had never heard of Lossit before this, so at the very least it's an interesting(and tasty!) history lesson."
