4.0,"Sweet, smoky vanilla and caramel on the nose with a full, oily middle and a long leathery, spicy finish. All this with about three drops of filtered water in a 2oz. pour. I think it gets more interesting if you let it sit a bit between sips. I'll try the other two bottlings I have then re-visit all three side-by-side."

5.0,"At a New Years gathering and someone said there was Bookers. I said, “Ooooh, what kind?” It’s this guy. The nose starts out sour and oaky. As it rises from the glass it becomes a drying aroma. It gives the impression of opening up an antique wooden chest. On the palate, there are herbs and spices up front, like basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes. There is a juicy berry sweetness mid-palate, and lots of complexity at the back. Mouthwatering and incredibly astringent, this bourbon finishes burning all the way down, numbing and soothing. What I needed all 2017 but only got at its end. (Partially kidding.)"

null,"High proof, very complex. The proof/heat of it take away some of the flavor notes. It's an interesting change from the norm - unique flavor and feel, but not worth the $60."

3.75,"I am running low on my Booker's stash and had to dig deeper in the vault to pull this one out! The 2017 and 2018 batches have been so good, I have not felt the need to break this one open! With the price of Booker's now north of $75, I figured there was no better time to crack this one!
Upon entry it's classic Booker's notes of vanilla, burnt brown sugar and peanut brittle. Some spice in the mid pallette with slight smoke, oak and the return of vanilla on the long ish finish. A hint of leather as well.
This is a pretty tame and easy to drink Booker's. For some that may be welcome, for me, I prefer my Booker's to be in your face and very big. So this one falls just a little short of the typical Booker's experience. Not bad at all, just not on the level of the more recent batches! 
A big rock did actually improve this one bringing out rich toffee and butterscotch notes whilst maintaining it's viscosity. Even though it's not a hot batch, the big rock is the way to go with this one. 
Cheers all!"

3.75,"Ohh this is a good one. Had with @salvatore8 and @James-Pak for a nice Friday afternoon after a meeting. Beautiful smell. When you first crack the bottle you get a nice warm sweet caramel smell. There is a matching taste. It is hot for sure, but I wouldn't say too much. I would for sure enjoy this with friends. This is one of my favorite Booker's."
