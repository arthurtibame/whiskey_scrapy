3.0,"As one of the more unknown distilleries, Glen Moray is a bit off the radar. However, sometimes there is more than first meets the eye. The shy Speyside nose of this 12-year-old expression offers fresh fruits, orange peel and honey. With water, the fruitiness intensifies with sour plums, apricots and marzipan. On the palate, sweet and malty flavors combine with bitter lemon, cinnamon and a touch of wood spices. Short but pleasant in the finish, the aftertaste fades with hints of chocolate and licorice. A refreshingly honest and reasonably priced Single Malt!

3.0,"Interesting, and in some ways complex, but there's something towards the finish that I just don't like. The nose is very clean and fresh, with hints of honey and a certain herbaceous note. Quite sweet actually. The palate exhibits barley and vanilla, progressing towards a finish I find a little flat and bitter. It's ok, but not more than that."

4.0,"glen moray is my enduring ""best on field per price point"" in the speyside single malt scotch segment.  it's a fantastic dram and continues to offer age statements where others cannot.  that fact may speak to their historically diminished single malt profile, and their key role in supplying high throughput blends.  But as an everyday, bat-away single malt, there is very little on the market to give you better quality for investment."

3.0,"Nose: Orchard fruits, vanilla, light honey, faint notes of violets and rose, but very gentle, soft and understated. The dry-glass aroma is of sweet honey and is surprisingly reminiscent of Highland Park 12, but without that whisky's subtle smoke or complexity - a sort of ""Highland Park lite"".

Palate: Vanilla, malt, cereal and honey. Very sweet and juicy but quite light in character. Some nuttiness.

Finish: Medium-short. It trails off into faint woody notes. There is a pleasant warming aspect to the finish as well.

Overall this is a very soft and shy whisky bottled at the minimum ABV. Water is not required to enjoy it, but it does bring out a touch more depth in the palate. If adding water only a few drops are required.  As a mixer with soda it makes a refreshing and light aperatif, but with anything else it is a little understated.

Interestingly, its sweetness makes it reminiscent of bourbon when mixed with coke or in coffee. This is not a challenging or deep whisky, but it is a light, pleasant everyday dram that is comparable to the better blends in this price bracket. If I had to choose between a bottle of this or the Compass Box Great King St Artists Blend it would be a tough call. A solid three stars and good value at the price.

UPDATE - As this whisky oxidises it gains richness and depth in the fruit flavours. The array of orchard fruits turns into a whole market stall of tropical fruits - banana, guava, mango, pineapple ... quite delicious, but not subtle and very sweet. If you have a sweet tooth this is a great value inexpensive malt, however if you don't it will seem much too sickly-sweet and cloying.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars."

3.0,"Lovely nose and taste that the caramel/spicy, but rather short, finish can’t live up to. 87"
4.0,"The more complex big brother of the Elgin Classic I can only find at my local store. Nose consists of honey comb cereal, green apple, and fresh cut grass. Sweetness of honey on the taste with a little pear, orange peal, and spice. The finish is medium short with some spice and lemongrass. This is not an overly complex whiskey and there is not a darn thing wrong with that. It is a great whiskey for kicking back with a good book or a warm summers fire. I give it an 87."

3.75,"Look: Fairly light, straw colored. Compared to the bourbon next to this whisky in my closet, this is looks like a light beer sans carbonation. Dark on the edges, alcohol legs that drip down, Glen Moray looks par for the course:

Nose: A lot of toffee hits me from a distance, with some grape, pear, and other fruity notes. Sticking my nose into the glass further, I get more toffee, less fruit, and more malt/bread. Agitating the glass gives more floral and fruit smell. 

Palate: Bready, and fruity on the first sip. Some of the grape that I was picking up in the nose shows itself, followed by pear, caramel, toffee. 

Finish: Slight heat, fruity earthy finish is what I’m getting, and hangs on for a bit. 

Overall: I like this, and for less than $35 a bottle, this is a decent bargain pickup. Usually one of the cheaper single malts I see, Glen Moray 12 is worth a shot."

Bottled at 40%abv with a yellow gold color.

On the nose you get the most of it, with prune peel, vanilla cream, earth (dirt), grape branches, cabernet Sauvignon wine, nutty and medicinal notes. Almost perfumed.

On the palate is a little hot and harsh, but manages to deliver. Main notes: Honey, wood (oak), almonds, cereal, oranges, and spices in a pleasant way. Finish is spicy and hot, long and full, one of its perks. Medium bodied, and mostly hot, this is a fair dram. 80 out of 100."

3.0,"Bought this as inexpensive($30) 12 yr single malt I hadn't tried. At 80pf and chill filtered its a light scotch and yes it leans to the sweet side. Poured neat, nose I get strawberry, peach, sweet apple with malt, no dark notes. Palate is rich malt, berries and honey vanilla fading to oak. Finish is medium, fruity dry and woody. No peat/smoke and plenty of fruit in line with most Speysides. I enjoyed the light fresh sweet flavor. Overall it has some good malt presence which I like but does lack body and depth. Its a little hot for 80pf but still drinks very easy. Simple and accessible, good value for 12yr SM. Im glad I tried it, I like it and will check out other Glen Moray offerings ................81/100"
3.25,"ELGIN HERITAGE: Neat, at home: Rounded notes of CARAMEL and TOFFEE; rich honey. Vanilla creme with a second wave of sea salt. The body is chewy and slick. The burn is barely there. Peat is there but very much a secondary CHARACTER. LEMON squares, Graham cracker crust, tartness at the end. Definitely a lemon meringue finish. 

With a droplet of water, the salt emerges and a more mineral component comes out. (Maybe it's my water?) More tobacco and autumn leaves come out. The toffee and caramel also mellow out. Peat actually blooms a bit with a drop. It sticks on the lips."
