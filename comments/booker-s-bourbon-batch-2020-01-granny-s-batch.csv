3.0,Disappointing for a Booker.   Traditional Beam taste of peanuts and Booker heat.  But seems to lack the depth of previous versions.
4.0,"Ice really opened up the flavor of this. Oak, fruit, and vanilla finish. I got a heavy nut flavor right away, but it goes away fast. I’m a huge Jim Beam fan and this batch is quite different from previous years."
3.5,Crunchy peanut buttery savoriness combined with some brown sugar sweetness. A bit of ethanol on the nose as you’d expect from a 126 proofer. Good warmth and Kentucky hug but not overpowering heat. Very excited as this is off the neck pour. Cheers!
2.5,"Consistent first batch, heavy heat throughout like Kathleen and Teresa.  Flavor overpowered by heat.  More flavor than antique 107, similar heat"
2.0,"Giving it a 2 because I need to justify the $90 I just spent.  Hay, Hay, grass and bitter peanuts.  This is terrible, most disappointing bourbon I’ve had since the latest Black Maple Hill out of Oregon."

3.25,"As someone else posted earlier, very earthy with hay notes. Reminds me of an old musty cow barn with dirt floors we had growing up"
2.75,"This Bookers was my first to have tasted. I haven’t had much experience with anything over 107 proof, so this being 126 was a new experience for me. The heat wasn’t as harsh as I expected when sipped neat. As far as taste goes the two big things that I noticed is an up front earthy almost grass like flavor that was soon followed by long lasting oak barrel. A nice addition to have around but I don’t feel I will reach for this quite as often as other bottles."

4.25,"Reeses Pieces all day on the nose. Doesn’t fall off too much from that after the initial sip. I love me some Booker’s!! The more I buy these the more I can appreciate the nuances present while still maintains that big, rich, flavor profile Booker’s is known for. Simply awesome stuff!"

5.0,"Best batch I've had in some time.  Better than any 2019 release, maybe better than any 2018 or comparable to ""Kitchen Table,"" which was my favorite that year

The 2020-01 ""Granny's Batch"" smells of warm peanut brittle, brown sugar, and fried apple fritters.   A wide complexity of flavors comes through with old-fashioned cinnamon donut, peanut brittle, caramel, vanilla and candied orange spread through a medium-long finish."
3.25,"This has opened up a bit and not so bitter and harsh now, still not great but definitely get more sweet notes along with a strong peanut profile.  Kinda peanut brittle like the Distiller review said."
3.75,"Previous reviews have been right on the money with the descriptions of earthy, grassy notes wafting from my Norlan glass.  Although I appreciate the complexity, it’s not what I enjoy in a nose. With that said, Granny’s Batch redeems itself on the palate and more so on the finish.  The earthy notes continue on the palate with caramel and cinnamon flavors taking over on the back end. The finish is incredibly long as you would expect a 126 proof bourbon to be. This is much in line with what other expressions of Booker’s have brought over the last couple of years. I must say that the Booker’s line is my favorite across the board, however this one has to be my least favorite so far."

1.5,I opened my bottle several weeks ago and I didn’t enjoy the first testing. I have gone back a couple of times since and I haven’t even been able to finish the glass. This is the worst Bookers I’ve ever had and it may be the worst bourbon I’ve ever had since it now cost $90. It’s hard to put a finger on what I’m tasting but smoked tobacco to aged plastic.
5.0,"Bookers is always, hands down, my favorite whiskey, period."
3.75,The nose brings peanut brittle while the taste brings spicy vanilla with a salt water finish

3.25,Slight burn upfront but smooth finish. Smells like peanut butter
3.75,null
3.5,"Nose: Heavy Peanuts, roasted and salted. Also get underlying notes of peanut brittle. Some oak spice as well.

Palate: peanut butter all the way. Baking spices and oak are noticeable towards the finish.

Finish: that salted peanut note shows up with cinnamon. Finish is medium to long and crawls down the back of the tongue.

Overall I’m impressed, but not crazy complex compared to previous batches!"

2.75,I’m not a fan of this batch. Taste of sweet Tobacco/cigar. It becomes slightly more bearable with some ice.

4.5,"Nose:  Not the best out of the booker’s as it’s almost mildew.
First Taste:  full body oak up front and some proof.
Finish:  Fantastic sweet finish with some burn from the proof."
4.25,Peanuts!!!!
5.0,Solid.  Good spice great finish.
4.25,"Nose: This is definitely Booker's - dusty corn, light brown sugar, and barrel, with some nice char in the mix.  Fresh chocolate chip cookies, peanuts.  Mint, camphor.  It has some of that bready quality that you'll see in most Booker's, though not as much.  Apricot and lemon.  Alcohol shows up, though not punishingly.

Palate: Even more of what you'd expect - sweet corn, brown sugar, vanilla, and more of that barrel character with accompanying toast and char - barrel bitter/bite on display here.  Buttered toasted wheat bread.  Warm dark chocolate chip cookies.  Roasted, salted peanuts, mint.  Tannin character, though nothing crazy.  Cinnamon candy somewhere between Red Hots and Cinnamon Mike And Ikes.  Apricot, strawberry, and banana sweetness, to boot.  Mouthfeel is medium, leaning toward medium-light.  Finish starts with a solid punch of barrel, tannin, smoke, and brown sugar.  The brown sugar and barrel evolve together into a sort of burnt caramel and whipped cream, along with a swell of ethanol and fruit.  The sweetness and fruit fade off and you're left with fading alcohol, barrel, and tannin.  Finish is medium-long.

Other notes: I've never disliked a Booker's release.  I find these to all be high quality, beautiful expressions that are very well blended.  Though this does not live up to the high bar I have for most Booker's releases, this is still very good.  It stretches into some pretty uncharacteristic territory for them, which I find both unusual and also pretty exciting.  A solid buy, and I will likely buy another bottle to explore some more simply because this was just so unusual and warrants more of my attention."
4.5,"I don’t always go for high proof, but this stuff is quite nice.  👍🏼"
3.75,"Peanut brittle is a great descriptor, it’s very forward and identifiable. This is a full bodied whiskey that doesn’t pull any punches."

4.5,"Aroma is soft with sweet brown sugar and caramel. Starts with a nutty sweet pecan taste. Buttery and thick on the tongue. Finishes with smooth with a high octane warmth in the chest. 

Nice. 👍👍"
3.75,"This is really a very nice early year bourbon offering at a time when most of the A1-- series aren't as good as b or c offerings it's nice something so early is so good. This one needs time to open up though. Right out the bottle the nose is quite ethanol heavy. Once that is out of the way the nose is typical jim beam profile salted peanuts in the shell, dark almost burnt corn sweetness(not quite caramel), vanilla cream, apple/pear fruit note and balanced amount of baking spices. First taste goes sideways but in a good way. It's unique and interesting fruit/sweetness to say the least. The rest of the glass once your palate is accustomed to booker's is the salted, creamy peanut brittle, cinnamon spice, light alcohol ding, vanilla cream and light charred oak. Finish is looonnng. The spices and cinnamon tingles the tongue well after swallowing, the oak, fruit and vanilla with the sweetness linger on the finish obviously the charred oak lasts the longest. Very good I've never tried the 30th anniversary but some liken this whiskey to that in similarity if that is true then this is a very good whiskey if not then it's still a very good whiskey."
