null,"Had this at the Chivas event, and it was wonderful. Lots of wood, dry finish, smooth and pleasant sherry. It goes for around & $900 in stores and is about $175 for a single glass at a bar. My brother and I each had two glasses!"

4.5,"Another super premium whisky from Pernod Ricard's Chivas Regal, this time a 38yo expression, called Royal Salute: Stone of Destiny, whose name comes from the ancient red stone used for coronation of scottish kings and later in history, in the coronation of brittish kings and queens.

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, Fresh Orange cut in half (just as Chivas 18yo or Ballantine's 30yo). 
An artificial orange juice called ""Tang"", i don't know if you have ever had it but it is just like that. Watermelon (wow! That is a first!); Caramel and Toffee.

On the palate: Super smooth, Vanilla esence, Spiciness builds with every sip. 

Aftertaste is AMAZING. Toffee with spices, such a buttery, pleasant finish.

Overall this is what high end blends can achieve. Maybe a little straightforward on the tasting notes, but definitively very well crafted and delicious. I know it is expensive, but if you can have a glass of it, don't doubt, you will love it. 94 over 100. Sláinte!"
