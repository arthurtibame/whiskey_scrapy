2.5,"Not the headline but a rare society release: Hazelburn 11 years old society release 2019

54,2%, newly opened on world whiskey day (16.5) 2020

Glass Clencairn
Color: light yellow golden, almost greenish hue
Nose: pepper, sweetness, hay or moss. Adding water produces herbal / grass notes as well
Palate: very distinctive mineral and medicinal notes, chili burn on the tongue from the high alcohol content. Water tames it a bit. 
Finish: medicinal with tree bark, not very long

A decent dram, and a rare bottle. Not my favorite, though 2,5/5"
3.5,"Appearance: golden with heavy viscosity 

Nose: baked apple, cardamom, grapefruit, salted caramel, lime, anise, lemon, orange, pine

Palate: sharp yet creamy. Citrusy"
