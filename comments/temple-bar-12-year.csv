0.5,"A friend brought this to me after he tried it a few times and didn't enjoy it.  He wanted my opinion.  We don't always agree, so I kept a completely open mind.

I can only describe this whiskey as awful.  It was bad enough that I did not linger over the fine points of it's descriptors.  There was a dominant, unpleasant, but difficult to identify flavour on the palate.  Finally, it clicked: soap.  With that note in place, I will stand by my description of the palate as ""dirty dishwater"", which is where the rest of this bottle belongs."
