2.5,"To be honest, I expected a bit more of it. The grassy taste at the back of the throat is something that I disliked. Also, its finish is fast and unmemorable."

3.0,"If you don't go in with high expectations--and let's be honest, why would you, because we're talking a sub-$40, no-age-statement single malt at bare-minimum 40% ABV, courtesy of that corporate titan Diageo--again, if you don't go in with high expectations, this one is surprisingly likeable. One-dimensional and sweet, with basically no finish, but likeable. Smell is sweet lemon and sweet red fruits (berries, red apple); slightly doughy, some vanilla and caramel. Very, very, very faint smoke? Body is fairly creamy for the low ABV: red apple (+ apple skin), lemon, some dough or yeastiness, a bit of pepper. Very sweet, with just a tiny floral/herbacious note. Orange zest and berries. Finish is gone in an instant--just some vinous fruitiness, light apple, and a bit of fresh lumber. Easy to drink and pleasant enough. But then so are a lot of whiskies."

null,"This is a very well priced malt, both bottles I've purchased have been sub £25, added to that it is a very nice drinking malt  Nice light flavour, easy on the palette, nice for a quite evening by the fire when you don't want a peaty well aged malt and maybe want a couple more than you would normality have."

3.0,"3.25. Sherry and oak just punch through immediately. Creamy mouth feel, finishes dry, some subtle tobacco & smoke notes. Pretty nicely balanced for the intense fruity sherry notes you get on the palate."
