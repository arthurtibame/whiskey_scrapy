2.0,"WhiskeyLive NJ.  Had a quick taste more so out of curiosity than anything else.  Aroma is amazing, autumn in a bottle.  Taste...not so much...couldn’t have more than a sip.  Better idea is to place this over a non-flammable heat source, and just smell away.  Then again...you can get Glade air fresheners for a fraction of the price, and will do the same job.  On a side note: the guy who was pouring this, I fixed his technology issue on his iPad during the WhiskeyLive...I’m glad he didn’t repay me by pouring extra"
