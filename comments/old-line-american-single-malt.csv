3.0,"During one on Maryland visits, at one of the spirit stores I visit, Old Line was having a tasting and was fortunate enough to talk to one of the new owners, Mark McLaughlin.  A former Navy Flight Officer, he and his business partner, as we discussed, went under apprenticeship from the original Navy veteran from Washington State, purchased and moved operations to Baltimore, Maryland.  This particular whiskey was “aged at least two years in 10 gallon barrels” that is “aged in charred, new white oak casks"" and “distilled on Samish Island, WA”.  He is passionate and enthusiastic and looking expand the reaches of Old Line.
      
      The color is deep amber, though uncertain if that is it’s natural color.  It is distilled from 100% malted barley.
      
      The nose is very much bourbon-like.  Somewhat simple with vanilla and spices of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  
      
      A lightweight body arrives with an initial rush of oak.  The oak transforms to a momentary sweet vanilla and maple syrup or rich caramel.  That glimpse of sweetness give way to dry cinnamon spice.  As it starts the finish, the palate gets slightly bitter .
      
      The finish is woody-oak and drying.  You are ultimately left with the flavors of cinnamon, bitter orange rind and black licorice.   
      
      When water is added, an “American Mist” (can’t truly call it a Scotch Mist) forms.  The sweetness is diminished though the dram becomes more cohesive, but I prefer without water.
      
      Though it’s distilled purely with barley, it has all the flavorings and characteristics of a bourbon.  A decent and enjoyable whiskey.  Not overly sweet and has that spicy and oaky that I enjoy out of a bourbon. [Dry Glass: Faint candy corn][84/100][$42][Tasted: 9/22/17]"

4.0,Wonderful American single malt. Dark amber color. Aroma of vanilla. Taste of both vanilla and caramel. A little bite on tasting. Caramel and apple on the aftertaste. Definitely oak in the palate. Good stuff. Makes a great old fashioned.
4.0,"Notes of vanilla, definitely oak and caramel. Really nice finish."

2.0,"I love trying American craft distilleries, gotta hand it to their ingenuity, trying various techniques to overcome the shortage of time.  They don't have the luxury of waiting 18 years.  No, they need to get 'er done in less than 2 years.  How else are they going to sell this otherwise to Diageo or LVMH or Pernod-Ricard?  Show a great IRR, strong customer segment, and a unique market.  They're going the route of George Clooney, High West and Del Maguey.  But American craft distilleries are caught in a bind.  They can't just overnight produce a 18 yr old, and yet their sheer labor cost elevate prices to those of 18 yr olds ( $100 for a 2 year Westland anyone?).   This sample was provided by Scott as a bonus sample in our trading team.  Sour apples.  Strong strong oak...like new wood.  A bit bitter.  It's a good effort, and you really gotta commend the hands-on craftsmanship.  But, needs a bit more time to ease things off or maybe a finishing to hide the bitterness."
3.0,"This review is from a bonus sample provided by Scott from our tour group. Old Line is a new comer to the whiskey world. This is an American single malt made from 100% malted barley from the Pacific Northwest. Made in pot stills and aged in charred new American oak 10 gallon bucke...I mean barrels, for two years. Bottled at 43% ABV and is probably natural color of a beautiful deep red mahogany. Most likely chill filtered. 

The nose starts off a little harsh, but a little extra time takes care of that. Strong charred oak. Vanilla, toffee, caramel and maraschino cherries. A little malty, but the oak hides most of it. Red apples and a little berry note. Not bad for only 2 years. After a little more time, some buttercream and vanilla cake, roasted caramel malts and brown sugar appear. There is a slight cardboard note that is a little out of place. Some cinnamon and clove in there as well. 

Very strong oak on the palate. Somewhat bitter. Vanilla and cherry cough syrup. Sour apples, burnt toffee and caramel. Cinnamon and clove. More bitterness comes in, it really erases the nose in the overall experience. 

I added water to see what would happen. It takes out any harshness in the nose and brings out more toffee and apples. Water nearly kills the palate but everything is still there, including the bitterness, just all weakened. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel. Dry but fairly smooth. 
The finish is long, but that is a bad thing here. Bitter oak, cough syrup and barrel char. 

It's my belief that the use of such small barrels was simply a way to get product on shelves as fast as possible. I've heard that barley distilled in pot stills is a much harsher spirit than a corn mash bill from column stills. This is why scotch is not typically matured exclusively in virgin oak, because the wood tannins are extracted too quickly and does not play well with the new make spirit. I could be wrong on that, but it's what I remember. The nose on this young single malt is pleasant enough, but the palate and finish killed it for me. 3 stars, but it could be a 3.25 with water. Thanks for the sample Scott. 
Cheers"
3.0,"This is an American take on a single malt whisky.  It was supplied by a member of our scotch sample trading group as an extra.  Our extras range from craft beer to tequila to gin to Indian whisky to bourbon and even other scotches.  This one was sent by Scott from Long Island.  He picked it up on a trip to Baltimore, MD.  Thanks, my friend.

It’s a deep mahogany in color and makes some fat legs in the taster.  It gives off your typical bourbon aromas on the nose:  vanilla, cinnamon and fresh cut cedar.  The palate is a bit harsh, but I found that this stuff is only 2 years old and was aged in very small, 10 gallon charred oak barrels and made using malted barley sourced from the Pacific Northwest.

The finish is hot, somewhat harsh and long.  You can tell it’s very young, but the flavor and punch are there.  It would be very cool to try this stuff after it sits in the barrel for 7-8+ years.  I’d love to know if it mellowed while it kept extracting that beautiful charred oak flavor profile.  As is, it’s better than I expected but I’d have a hard time justifying more than 3.25-3.5 stars.  Overall, an enjoyable extra.  Thanks again, Scott.  Cheers."
