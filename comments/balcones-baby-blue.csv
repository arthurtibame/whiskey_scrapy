3.0,"Batch No. B817-1; Date 03-07-17 (no idea what the date refers to)

We don't often get Balcones products in NC, and when we do, this and Rumble are the cheapest offerings on the shelves. I picked this up last summer and have avoided it, it's just not my jam. For a product with a 6-month age statement the color and oak influence are insane. If you were unsure what happens in Texas heat, this is a prime example of what it can do.

The nose is a cinnamon bun without vanilla frosting. It is sweet and bready, similar to Brown-Forman products, especially their double oaked offerings. It is sickly sweet on the tongue. Too sweet for my palate, and I have a gigantic sweet tooth. Most BF whiskeys I've had have balanced sugar, oak, and alcohol flavors. That sugar overpowers other nuanced flavors you may get if this was aged in a different climate or had a different mashbill. It tastes very malty to me with the classic malt funk replaced by oak and cinnamon bread.  

My opinion has not changed since I first bought the bottle. It is too damn sweet. It's kind of like George Dickel going off the rails and adding artificial sweetener to its GD12 or BiB. Actually for me the closest comparison is Rua American Single Malt. Yes I know this is corn and that is malted barley, but I think the similarities in flavor come from aging. Balcones has that Texas heat, Rua has NC heat combined with aging in small barrels. I think the flavor in both is primarily influenced by the oak barrels and not the new make itself. Because the Rua wasn't as sweet and had more complex flavors, I enjoyed it much more. If you are interested in corn whiskey I suggest trying something cheaper first."

3.0,I really enjoy the butterscotch on the nose and some of those sweeter caramelized sugar notes but I don’t think it really follows through on the palate. I think those sweeter notes are coming from using the blue corn which I think I may prefer to the standard yellow but this whiskey maybe has not been aged long enough to clear up those more astringent notes. A strong effort but not my choice.

In the glass it has some nice oiliness to it, with the runners slow and thick on a glass swirl. Alcohol harshness on the front end of the palate, but quickly gave way to a pleasant mix of buttered popcorn and vanilla sweetness. Medium finish that carries the sweetness all the way through. a little water helps open it up and take the front end harshness.  Definitely worth picking up for the uniqueness."

3.0,"Day 15. We continue with blue, but instead of a blue label, we get blue corn today. My first corn Whiskey if I remember correctly. On the nose you get hit with a lot of sugar, some corn, marzipan, bit of vanilla and subtle hints of banana. Really aggressivly sweet smell. The taste is not quite as sweet, but still on the high end of sweetness. We get a lot of vanilla, the raw sugar of the nose transformed into a brown, roasted sugar with a bit of banana and cinnamon. The short aftertaste is just sweet vanilla. This is a tasty whiskey for sure, more of a dessert than anything else, but it's a bit one dimensional. Sweet, sweet, and banana. Nice if you're in the mood for sticky sweetness, otherwise grab something else."

This tastes like you'd expect a pure corn whiskey to taste. Sweet, pure, with limited barrel flavor. It tastes surprisingly full(?) but I'm not sure what of. Floral/fruity like a subtle Irish whiskey and a bit salty/smoky but nothing distinct. This is smooth with a slight woody after taste, like a blend between those Utica moonshiners and Woodford. Easy drinker straight, this would be dangerous over ice.

3.5,"First foray into both Balcones and 100% corn whiskey in general. Looking forward to something off the beaten path. 

Ok so before we get to far in, let me just say this thing is SWEET. And I mean really sweet, like a sticky bun with extra icing. (Not the flavor components of one, but just trying to illustrate the level of sweetness) 

The nose is powerful; even if you set the glass down away from your face you can still get the occasional whiff wafting from the glass from a few feet away. Rich scents of English toffee, caramel, powdered sugar, and vanilla.  Underneath all the sweet is buttered popcorn. Smells pretty heavenly. 

The palate opens with the toffee from the nose, but quickly switches to various corn flavors. Getting sweet creamed corn as well as stone ground tortilla chips. Just before the finish there's a nice buttery flavor. 

The finish is where things take a downturn. I think the best way to describe it is that it tastes and feels young. There's a grainy harshness which doesn't compliment the nose or palate at all. It's not that it's terribly astringent, it's just not the finish you are craving after what’s already been presented; your tongue wants silky smoothness and instead it gets mugged and has it's wallet stolen. After the harshness fades, there is a lingering flavor of popcorn. It is a short finish and the mouthfeel is medium. 

I think I like the idea of this whiskey better than the whiskey itself. Overall, it's interesting and unique, but the juxtaposition between the palate and finish didn't work for me. That said, I am interested to try other Balcones products as I see where they are going here. At a craft distillery price point of $57, can't say I'd recommend this one."

4.25,Super buttery sweet butterscotch/toffee on the nose. Much more classic bourbon/corn whiskey taste. Tastes like a higher proof but without the burn. Very unique whiskey and definitely worth a try.
4.5,"Sweet and fruity with a suprising, pleasant bite. It hits right away with fruit and spice which quickly mellows to a buttery smoothness that holds on to the tongue for a long time."
4.5,"Smooth, Carmel, vanilla, brown sugar...NO burn. Really a delightful pour!"

4.0,"Killing some time at IAH with this one. Since I apparently can only compare whiskies to dessert items nowadays, this is banana pudding. Banana, vanilla cream, biscuity cookie, and a little hint of caramelized sugar. Rich, round mouthfeel and a sweet, lingering finish. No complaints here."

2.75,"I never do this but I couldn’t help myself - the suggestion seemed so outrageous. Distiller recommends Balcones Baby Blue Corn Whisky if you seek a more floral version of The Macallan 12 Year Old Double Cask (previous tasting). Let’s see just how odd this lineup is. 

Balcones Baby Blue is a corn whisky made from roasted heirloom blue corn and aged a minimum of 6 months in some sort of oak. It used to be aged in new, lightly charred American oak but I don’t see that on the bottle anywhere. Bottled at 46% ABV and features a curious, faintly green-tinged gold color. (The green is readily apparent if you hold it up to a light.)

Nose: Buttered corn. Loads of it. I’m tempted to double check that there aren't actually buttered corn kernels resting at the bottom of my glencairn. You can smell the corn cob, dusty husk, and all the rest. After wading through the corn maze, you are greeted with loads of vanilla and honey-drizzled bread. 

Palate: Holy buttered popcorn, Batman! Rich and oily mouthfeel with surprising amounts of spice and oaky astringency considering how little time this has spent in a barrel. Lightly salted, buttery nuts and spicy baked apple - I’m not sure how’d you’d prepare this kind of spicy baked apple, but it’s there. A floral and herbal quality so faint, it could just be mistaken for more corn notes. 

Finish: Starts sweet and a little leathery, but quickly returns to tannic oak. Somewhat reminiscent of a darkly roasted coffee but without the coffee’s overwhelming acidity. Very young and a bit harsh. Warming. 

Empty Glass: Buttered popcorn jelly beans. 

I know Distiller is just generally plotting the flavor, but I don’t see how the profile of Baby Blue is remotely close to Macallan 12 Year Old Double Cask. I won’t bother comparing and contrasting them here. In any case, while this is certainly an interesting dram to visit occasionally, I’d get bored of it quickly. It would be like ignoring all the other jelly beans and just seeking the buttered popcorn flavor. For the rest of your life. I can’t handle that much diacetyl (and it’s not because of my fears of popcorn lung disease).  

This is right around a 2.75 to 3.0 for me but I don’t like it as much as the other drams I’ve rated 3.0. I’m putting 2.75 but it’s more like a 2.9 from me.

Taste is initially caramel, with little hints of sweetness. Not a ton of oak flavor because of how young it is. Very light texture.

I’ll be honest, at first smell and taste this made me think of cheap tequila. I wasn’t sure how to describe it but that’s the thought that came to mind.  I really didn’t like it.  By the end of the glass it started to grow on me.  It is unique and interesting.  Definitely nothing like a standard bourbon, which is what I expected and probably why I was so put off at first.  I still think it has as much or more in common with tequila and bourbon.  Worth trying for the unique factor, but not my style."

3.25,Light and sweet on the nose. Maybe a sweet oat bread sent. Taste is a bit nutty with spice and a semi smooth finish.
3.5,"Very young, indeed. Nose is corn (obviously...) pears and other sweet fruit, burnt caramel. subdued barrel notes linger.  Very distinct nose.
Gets more exciting on the palate.  It's sweet and lively, with a bit of an oily stickiness.  Soft slow rollout of corn-barrel-corn and other grain notes mixed with spices and a hint of saltiness.
It's interesting, for sure.  Probably not something I'd do again, but that's not because it isn't good...  I just prefer bourbon!"

2.0,"The nose is light with caramel and some grass. An interesting chalky scent comes out that makes it seem odd and reminds me of Corsair Quinoa's earthiness, though with a sweeter note rather than the bitter teabag scent mixed with dark fruits. It smells gross, like Lucky Charms (without the marshmallows) were steeped in it but with a bit of the malty, yeast still there. It certainly smells grainy. The palate has a bit of harshness - more than the nose suggests. The chalky grassiness immediately comes out and coats the tongue. The light caramel is there blending with the grass in a way that sort of works. The grain and grass intermingle here with the chalkiness (sort of like oatmeal dust) pervading. The grassiness here is a bigger problem than in Herradura Reposado because the citrus isn't present to add some bitterness and liven it up (also because tequila is supposed to taste more like vegetation). There's more sweetness here than in Herradura Reposado, but it's unbelievably grassy. The actual taste of oatmeal does come in too. Although the caramel doesn't have that fake, 6 month old sickly sweetness, it has a lightness that really makes it taste young. It tastes a lot like a reposado tequila; in fact, if you convinced me it was one I'd like it better. There is a nice hint of apricot on the finish, but it's more the thoroughly dried variety than the luxurious kind. On the long tail of the finish, there's a faint hint of coffee grounds. This isn't so much awful as it is weird, though it isn't really good either. Don Julio 1942 has some of the same flavor elements with the grainy variant on grassiness, but it is nowhere near as chalky and it has a much nicer caramel and more robust flavor. This tastes awful after trying Don Julio 1942, though I do get some of the subtleties coming out with the lightness. It's very interesting. The spice and smoke flavors are lightly present. There's plenty of vanilla, moving with a bit of a floral element. There's a little tartness but not too much. This is clearly predominantly corn (100%, as it turns out). I could believe that there was a small amount of rye in here, but wheat is definitely the closest other flavor that I get. Corsair is rich and luscious after drinking this, though with a bit of that Old Forester Signature flavor that lacks subtlety. Coming back to this drink, the mouthfeel is actually quite viscous and reminds me faintly of Don Julio 1942, but if Don Julio 1942 weren't very good. The complexity does eventually come out, saving this with a basket of grain flavors, but it never tastes great and the beginning is really rough. After every break - even just a minute long one - that painful first sip returns. Confusingly, the finish is substantially better than the nose or initial palate. Corsair Quinoa has a comparatively mild beginning and while it has fewer flavors in it, there's a rich, interesting quality to it that makes it more enjoyable. The finish on Corsair Quinoa evolves too, becoming more fruity with some more standard hedonistic notes of chocolate and tobacco."
