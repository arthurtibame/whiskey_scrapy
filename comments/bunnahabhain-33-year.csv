4.5,"On the nose:  Sweet flowers, over ripe apples, soft honey & roasted nuts, very smooth and almost no peat.  Some tobacco cigar notes and touches of orange. This smells great!

Palate: Honey & chocolate with touches of oranges, nuts and a little grassy.  Not bad and matches well with the what I smelled.  Some small outdoorsy notes but that is also what I like about it. Very good, smooth and elegant. 

Finish:  This is awesome!  Very smooth and beautiful on the nose and wonderful to drink.  Found myself smelling the glass for almost 15 min after I was done.  Only wish this was still around to have more.  A must have for any scotch drinker."
