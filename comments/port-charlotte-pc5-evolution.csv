4.5,"Drinking bleach does not cure coronavirus.  But, I’m not sure there isn’t a whisky that can’t.  If there is one that might, what whisky would that be?  Port Charlotte PC5 Evolution.  6,038 bottles were released in 2006.  The few bottles that remain out there in the secondary market are now fetching $500-900.  Well worth it, if it works against coronavirus.

This is the whisky that has the purest “medicinal” profile that I have ever tried.  PC5 is like fruits dissolved in 63.5% ethanol and 36.5% other chemical and organic solvents.  Is there even water in here?  There’s certainly butane, butyric acid, lactic acid, Sauerkraut water, and flaxseed oil.  The funky smoke on this whisky is unbelievable.  I don’t like cheese in general, and I hate stinky cheeses; but boy do I love stinky whiskies.  In the mouth, this has an engine oil viscosity.  The whisky is only 5 years old, and yet it offers an endless rich, farm smoke that feels 10,000 years old, and coiled inside the 7 invisible dimensions of string theory, freed only when you swallow and transition to the caliginous finish. 

Adding some water brings out the sweeter flavors for a more balanced whisky.  There is some milk chocolate, vanilla yogurt, and ripe blueberries in there.  But this whisky is so dominated by its acetic, poisonous smoke that these little peeps of benevolent notes are rather like intruders in a fathomless liquid that exists at the end of knowledge.  I have never owned a bottle of PC5, and I still think my PC8 is the better whisky, but this is probably because understanding the naked singularity that is PC5 is beyond my mind’s abilities.

Score: *** (I am not worthy)
