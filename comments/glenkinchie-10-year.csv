It's young age wasn't present through bites of alcohol but sort of springy notes and burst o flavour. Much, much better than the 12y.o"

4.0,"A really mild aroma on the nose, maybe a little weak. Immediate notes of honey, strong floral notes, and a lot of apply juice in the finish. Not a ton of peat, less when it’s cold. Overall this is really enjoyable."
