3.75,"Neat. Neck pour.  Nasa liquors Mars Attack pick, 12 year MGP.  Cabernet influence is front and center on the nose.  Getting raisins or dates with a cinnamon glaze.  The finish really mutes the typical MGP sweetness and leaves these dark, dry fruit notes in its place.  Getting behind the fruit, the rye begins to emerge and transitions into a dull vanilla.  Starting to get some buttery pie crust as well but still lacks the expected sweetness.  On the nose, I would say the finish mutes rather than compliments a typical MGP 12 year.  The longer I sit with it, that pie crust gets a bit darker and now leans more oak.

Texture is viscous, oily and coating.  The dry, dark fruits dominate the tongue.  I’d now call it a dark cherry.  There is a little confectionery sugar to it but again the sweetness is muted and the dark fruits are a bit bitter.  Transitions into a MGP butterscotch, which is a really nice note.  The finish is pure Cabernet and has decent legs.  The aftertaste is even like drinking Cabernet with a slight tannic feel.

After a taste, the sweetness on the nose is emerging.  That butterscotch note is now there on the nose and opens up more and more on the taste.

I was prepared to call this one disappointing. I was thinking almost this entire time that the cab finish just didn’t compliment the MGP.  But this pour has changed drastically sitting out for 30 minutes.  The dark bitter fruits taking a step back and letting the butterscotch out.  I’ll revisit this in a few months, I’m thinking it will actually open up into something quite nice.  Fingers crossed."
4.0,"Unexpectedly good. Cbrc club pick “bull somm”. 124.26 proof.

Lots of ethanol heat in the nose with some overly ripe fruit notes. None of the classic vanilla oak nose.

Flavors are very mellow for the proof and the nose. Interesting combination of underripe banana with overripe pears and apples. Finishes with lots of cherry and a hint of burnt sugars.

Dry finish, that lasts for days."
2.5,I’m a Kentucky Bourbon drinker and tried this for something different.  I tried it twice on the rocks and once in a Manhattan but I just could find any real redeeming qualities.....
4.25,Lots of flavor of the cab if that’s what your looking for.  I really like it.
