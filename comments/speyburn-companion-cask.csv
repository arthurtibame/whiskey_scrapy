3.75,"Single malt pick from Heritage in Denver. 

Agree with other reviewers, like an unpeated single malt. Very light in color and sweet on the nose.

Pear and white grape forward that finishes with a rye pepper punch... no dill or brine flavors though.

Delicious and easy drinking but not the most complex thing in the cabinet."

4.0,"""Appalachia Barrel Select"" pick. Honey, grain, pear, floral. Citrus nose. Heavy bourbon cask influence."
3.75,"Smell of pears, white grapes, and an assortment of citrus fruits and vanilla. Sweet  grain, honey and oatmeal lead the taste. A finish of white pepper with a smoothness close out a delightful whisky."

3.25,"For today's edition of the midweek dram review we have a pretty unique offering. So let's start with a little background on this one as it took some research to uncover. First the basics; This is an NAS single malt release from Speyburn. It's a US market exclusive that is non chill filtered, with natural colour and bottled at 46% abv. SRP is $40 and I paid $32.99. Nice proof for the price for sure! Now for where this one gets a little unique! It's a single cask offering where the retailer chooses their own individual cask that is unique to them. For my Bourbon drinkers this is the single malt equivalent of a ""store pick"". It's fully aged in casks sourced exclusively from Buffalo Trace Distillery, which are all first fill (source Speyburn Distillery via Facebook). They would not disclose to me the age of my specific barrel (Barrel # 349 picked by Costco AZ) nor the specific BT Whiskey the barrel previously held. Note Buffalo Trace and Speyburn are both owned by Sazerac hence their ability to get their hands on the casks.  
So far so good. For the price this is for sure an outstanding value. 
Now normally I don't get into nosing or colour, but I did notice that this one was particularly light in colour (straw/gold) and nosed like a classic non Peated single malt. I mention this because it so different from the pallette! Let's get to the tasting:
It enters soft with your typical notes of honey, malt and candied apples. This quickly moves to a spiced peanut notes, clove, oak spice and brown sugar. Finish is medium and features a big spice note (rye/clove) with orange peel and oak. It's all just about in balance and is truly a unique pour. It enters as a Speyside single malt and leaves as a Kentucky rye! I personally have never had such a pronounced Rye taste profile whilst tasting a single malt. 
Now there is no doubt this is a young distillate that is relying on the cask to do the heavy lifting and it just about pulls it off. If I had to guess, this particular cask previously held either a high rye Bourbon or Sazerac Rye. 
All in all, it's a unique and interesting pour that whilst not overly complex, it's does enough to keep your interest. At the price point it's hard to complain. 
For predominantly Scotch drinker's, I would say avoid this one as I think the profile will be a turn off. For Bourbon/Rye drinker's or just plain explorers, it's worth the price of admission for the experience. Cheers all!"
