3.0,"Aroma carries an almost winey sweetness with cereal grain and fruity sweetness complimenting it; Palate tastes a bit young/unintegrated with the woody notes which open to some caramel syrup; Finish though is quite nice with the sweet and spicy fade. It’s fun, but doesn’t feel like all the pieces have connected here."
4.0,Creamy and warm. Worth the price of admission!
