3.5,Sweet and salty carmel on the nose. Sweet notes of apple on the front with a burn on the back. Hallmarks of a young whiskey.

3.75,"A little lite, not smokey, sweet and with hints of caramel.  On the nose, this whisky is a little light.  On the palate hints of caramel and honey.  The finish is short, but satisfying.  During this time that people are looking for Japanese Whisky, Yamato offers a valuable option."
