4.25,"A fantastic bourbon!  Wish it was 100proof, but even so I haven't found a 100 proof or under bourbon in my collection that beats this juice.  A little pricey for a daily drinker, but if you can find it I would say it's with adding to your shelf."
4.0,"My first impression after the pour is that this is going to be sweet and rich.  The nose is sweet cream and candy nougat.  The color is a beautiful polished walnut. I let it rest about 10 minutes and tasted neat in a glencairn.

First sip is very impressive!  Sweet and smooth with a beautiful finish.  Great mouthfeel. 

The 94 proof is evident with its bite, but there's no ""ethanol"" elements to detract. Very suave.

 The contribution of the barrel is way more complex and complete than just about anything I've tasted in a 4 year old bourbon.  There's no age statement on the bottle. This is a blended straight bourbon, but the base elements are all 4.y.o. as I understand it. 

This is an OUTSTANDING bottle!  I can't wait to try their single barrel offerings!"

3.25,"Grass, vanilla and sugar nose, spicy and sweet palate, Boozy finish"
4.25,"Initial pour-

Nose: Caramel, oak, dark fruits, some cherry 

After sitting for 10 minutes-

Nose: Fruit, mostly cherry and vanilla, some oak and light caramel.

Palate: Mostly cherry, oak, dark fruits, light spice 

Finish: Medium, caramel, oak, and dark fruits, cherry 

This is surprising and impressive for a only being aged four years. Worth keeping on the shelf. Would recommend"
4.25,This was a bit of a surprise. A very young bourbon out of a northern distillery that rivals the bourbon trail. Very enticing smell leads to a vanilla laced spice. A fantastic match of sweet and spicy.
4.0,"Really quite good for a 4 yr whiskey. Like this a lot, wish it was available in FL"
3.75,"Very sweet and rich with a full vanilla, toffee, and oak finish. Really like this bottle."
