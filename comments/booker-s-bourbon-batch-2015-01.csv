5.0,"[Batch #: C07-A-12 / 7yrs; 0mos / 65.3%ABV] - Sweetness of the corn, Apple Betty, cinnamon and leather are on the nose.  The palate immediately discerns the oak tannins, drying the mouth.  Definitely hot and spicy (think concentrated Red Hots), pushing the limits but never exceeding those bounds.  The tongue is instantly anesthesized.  A bitter, extremely dry oak finish with a fair amount of tongue burn. Like licking the dry stave of bourbon-soaked cask. As sweet as it is on the nose, it's deceivingly hot and dry.  Imbibing at cask strength is definitely a daunting challenge. A healthy dose of water does not dimish the noses' sweetness, but decreases the cinnamon and leather.  The sweet profile without the spice is dominate.  Water makes it an easier dram to manage and definitely recommended.  Without it, hair will grow in the wrong places. I am a ""scotch guy"" but this is a bottle I will make sure I always have available. [94/100]. [Tasted: 3/2/15 @ Black Eyed Sally's, Hartford] [Opened: 4/12/15]."
5.0,Booker Noe created the Small Batch style of Boytbon with this one whiskey.  So strong yet smooth. Lots of tannins.  This edition of Bookers is the 25th anniversary of the bourbon but also the last Booker made him self before coming to sick to continue his work.

Can't beat the price...just above $55 .  Only downside?  Without ice...you'll be drunk by the 2nd glass (or end of the first one)."

5.0,"Ok. There's Bookers and then there's Bookers Batch 2015-1. Best bourbon I've had, easily. I tried it neat first but at almost 130 proof it had quite a bit of burn to it. Adding a single ice chip to it to soften that and opened up the whiskey like an explosion of caramel syrup. The palate is full bodied with oak and spices. The finish ghosts in after a few seconds with leather and oak and cinnamon."

5.0,"I normally don't drink bourbon but his one did it for me. Good for sipping and I take it neat. Liked the nice burn and rich flavours of spice, caramel, corn and vanilla and a great finish! Had opened a bottle of 1792 and the Booker's just blew it away. Bought myself a case! Excellent!"
1.0,"Drinking Booker's is like swallowing oak splinters! It is flavorful, but I can’t get past the overwhelming, harsh, bitter burning sensation, all the way down. Yes, I watered it to my preferred proof, and even further. And you know what I get? A watery burn instead of a rich and flavorful burn. I even tried it with ice–which I rarely do–but it still burns. I gave it several tries. I let it sit for quite a while between tries to oxidize. I even aerated it. It’s still harsh, bitter and painful to swallow. There are so many great bourbons out there, like Four Roses Single Barrel, Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel, Angel’s Envy, Stagg Jr, E.H. Taylor, Rock Hill Farms, Wild Turkey Rare Breed. Each and every one of those blows Booker’s right out of the water. Don’t waste your time or money with this. The Beam distillers obviously do NOT know how (or are unwilling) to cut out the nasty heads and tails from the distillation run. Same with Heaven Hill distillates. I’ve tried many, many bourbons; but if you don’t believe me, taste Bookers side-by-side with ANYTHING from Four Roses, Wild Turkey or Buffalo Trace. Life’s too short to choke down nasty bourbon like this."

5.0,"I'm a fan of Bookers but because of its price, it's stayed one of my special occasion pours. I have noticed a little variation between batches but the strong character and smoothness have remained a constant. I picked up a bottle of the 2015=01 and am damn impressed. A little less tannic than any other Bookers I've had and the other flavors seem to shine brighter. It's great neat. I got a great deal  ($39.99) on it and will   buy a little to put away.
It's the best bourbon that I've had to date by a good bit.  To my taste it's special."

The taste is sweet corn, caramel, & a hint of leather, not unpleasant at all. With a pure caramel finish, Bookers has a thick mouthfeel--you know it's there--but it's not oily. It's by far one of the best bourbons for the money."

As I gullibly touch the glass to my lips, a sudden ""FWOOSH"" of green banana and wood resin curl my nose-hairs. The instant the syrup-like medicinal candy-corn sap rushes onto my palate: My entire mouth starts fizzing, my ears pop and I suddenly find I've grown a full handle-bar mustache... Well played Booker, well played... Then the cinnamon fireball arrives, and stays for breakfast. I then tried it with (lots of) water... Then in a Manhattan (sacrilege, I know). It's like taming an angry lion with a folding chair and a towel-whip. The sweet vermouth realized what I was about and refused to pour from the bottle, like old ketchup. The ice then caught on fire and the cherry jumped out of the glass. I guess there's nothing left to do with the stuff but open clogged drains and remove grease stains from asphalt. Oh, believe me, it's good, a little too good... I'm going to go back to Scotch now... huddled in a corner... rocking back and forth..."

4.0,"Really Enjoyed this one as my first Booker's and have been a fan ever since.  Very rich, however, the High Proof does not ruin anything.  It only adds to its complexity.  Very smooth!

This bourbon goes into my ""Zombie Apocalypse"" Closet next to the ammo.  :-)"

4.0,"The nose is strong with the almost 130 proof, but if you can get past the alcohol it's sweet caramel and apples. The taste is similar with the initial punch of the alcohol. It leads down with dried fruit and caramel. A  long finish with tart fruit and caramel. Overall well rounded and very full and in your face. I'd give it 8.5/10"

4.0,very hot / borderline too hot and lacks depth. id say the 2015-03 batch is far superior. honestly not sure why this one is ranked so high
5.0,"Bought six bottles 2 yrs ago. Last night my local liquor store called and said he found six cases of this in the back. Made a deal to buy 2 cases dirt cheap. Of all the bourbon I’ve consumed, this specific bottling is the only one that I’ve sought out. It is without a doubt an amazing pour."

5.0,"Sipped neat. I love it. Lots of heat like a high proof will give you. Let it sit a little and you’ll smell some caramel, some vanilla. Like a fall candle. 

Have a taste and then let it sit. When I breathe with my mouth I get the the same peanut butter flavor like I would when eating a Reese’s cup and getting that dry-ish peanut butter flavor. Love it!"

1.25,"98!?!? This is easily one of the worst batches of Booker's I've had in the 12 years I've been a fan. Not very complex, low quality notes in disharmony, and like most Booker's, it's very hot for the proof-- which is something I easily forgive when Booker's is brings it's A-game. Bribe a critic, get 98, go figure. Most of the ""special release"" Booker's weren't very good at all compared to many other standard bottlings. It's always been a bit or miss brand, but to give this batch a 98, gives it a bad name."

4.75,I can definitely see why it's rare. It was nice and robust while staying sweet. Amazing whiskey and if I can get a hold of this at a good price I'll do it.

4.75,"Nose- honey roasted peanuts, vanilla, caramel candies, dark fruits, 

Palate- salted peanuts, red (spanish) peanuts, vanilla bean, toasted oak, dark fruits, cherry, caramel

Finish- Long, full bodied finish of oak and red spanish peanuts 

Wow. This lives up to the hype it receives. Nose is good, very balanced but a bit hot. Nice smells of peanuts and vanilla. Palate is where this shines. Unique flavors of peanuts i’ve never got in another bourbon. So balanced."
