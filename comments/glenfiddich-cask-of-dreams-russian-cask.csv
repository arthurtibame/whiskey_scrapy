5.0,"I know you haven't heard of this before. But now, you need it. Where did i found it? In St. Petersburg, Russia. In a restaurant called ""the tsar"" (very recommended too).

A REMARKABLY BEAUTIFUL GLENFIDDICH, Called the Cask of Dreams, Russian cask, 2012. 

It is now in my top 3 or 4 whiskies ever.

Bottled at 48.8%, with a light gold color.

On the nose, you will find: salt, raisins, dates, blackberry marmalade, vanilla cake, and a slight peatyness.

On the palate it is just wonderful. Cherry candy, red fruits, gentle hotness, tobacco, allspice, all wrapped up in a beautiful balanced way, with a long sweet finish of creme brulee and ashes. Just fantastic. Medium body, this one is a delicatessen.

97 over 100, the most interesting, breathtaking whisky i will have for a long time. CHEERS!"
