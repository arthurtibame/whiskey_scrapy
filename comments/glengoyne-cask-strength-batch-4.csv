3.25,"Brown sugar and a bit of alcohol burn on the nose -- expected in a cask strength really. I pick up some fig and light raisin in there too. some sherry notes but doesn't overpower the other scents.

Sherry and raisin on the taste. Spicy bite of a cask strength present. A drop or two of water doesn't seem to change it much."

4.0,A step down in price from the 21 year but still a damn nice drop. Reminds me of a CS less complex Bunnahabhain 18 in a way. Similar raiseny sherry profile. Great value at $65USD a bottle. Doesn't even need a drop of water.
