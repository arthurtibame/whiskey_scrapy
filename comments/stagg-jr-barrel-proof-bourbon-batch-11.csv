4.5,"On the nose: dark fruit (raisins?), cinnamon and vanilla. The arrival is syrupy and jammy, with the fruit stealing the show. The heat and spice make a strong entrance on the mid-palate, but given the proof this is a surprisingly smooth dram. The finish is long, with some bitter dark chocolate appearing with the cinnamon and some barrel char. A fantastic deal at $50"
5.0,Sticky. Loads of berries just like GTS. Stellar stuff!
4.0,Nice spice full flavor not getting as much of the cherry syrup flavor like with the previous batch I had. Which is some what disappointing but still a good bourbon. The high proof isn't over powering I would recommend this.
2.0,"Trash. All sizzle, no steak. Heat without flavor.

Nuts, dried fruit, baking spice on the nose.
Brown sugar sweetness and oak.
All of which are ham-handedly overrun by acetone and ethanol normally reserved for whiskey of a much higher proof. Next time just add pure grain to VOB."

4.75,"Despite the high proof of 127.4, this has a surprisingly soft smell. There are scents of salted soft caramel, with a hint of peanuts. I would compare the smell closely to peanut brittle. The taste has a comfortable warm burn. It leaves the tastes of applesauce and cherries that flows right into a sweet strawberry jam. There is a semi hidden note of leaves and fall. The finish is pleasant and leave behind notes of cinnamon and nutmeg."
3.5,Nice warm caramel

3.75,"Bubble gum, vanilla, Carmel on the nose. Baking spices and oak with cherry on the palette. Long sweet oak finish."
4.25,Hotter than batch 12 or 13 despite the proof. Less brown sugar on the nose and palate. Some fruit. Medium finish with heat. 12>13>11
