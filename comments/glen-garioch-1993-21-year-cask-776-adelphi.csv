3.5,"Ah man I heard Elon Musk went through production hell with the Model 3, I wonder if it's anything like Business Case hell. 2 weeks in and already 60 hr weeks, nearly 20 days straight by next Friday! I definitely needed a whiskey now I've hit the first milestone...

Anyway I think I grabbed this one as I'm a fan of Adelphi. They could take pure ethanol and turn it into a semi decent drop..a bit like my uni days when I managed to get hold of a supply of food grade ethanol from a chem lab and make 20% hazelnut beer out of it (I'm still not sure how or even why I did that as logically it makes no sense)...however unlike that god awful drop this is not to bad. It really shows the power of casking..be interested to know how long they finished it off for.

These guys are coming to NZ Dramfest in several weeks time and along with That Boutique Whiskey I'll be making a bee line for pretty rapidly. 

In saying all that however this drop is for me slightly overdone casking wise, not that complex, needs a fair bit if water (often a sign of imbalance in my mind) and not amongst their best efforts. I have a feeling the original base cask they got hold of wasn't a stunner as it seems a bit layered on, too thick, artificial and not well integrated. Still it's because I hold Adelphi to a high standard and by any other comparison it's a nice drop. Roll off Business Case hell and roll on Dramfest!."
