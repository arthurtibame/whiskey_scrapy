4.25,"I am not a big Bowmore fan, but this one and the 18 yo one are the best expressions of this brand. Bottled only for the travel retail market, the label says ""bourbon cask, golden and elegant"". Bottled at 43% with a tawny color. On the nose: burnt rubber as soon as you open the bottle, peat, salt, prunes, sea aroma and beach aroma, quite impressive notes. On the palate, not a lot going on: oranges, hotness in a pleasant way, a long spicy and ashy finish, and an aftertaste full of allspice. Overall i give this one a solid 84 over 100, maybe the best score for a Bowmore in my opinion. Cheers."
