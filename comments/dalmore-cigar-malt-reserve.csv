4.0,"Rich figgy nose. Petrichor, dark malt and caramel. Deep madagascar vanilla. Milder on the palate, bready challah, exotic spices accumulate and intensify before the long bittersweet finish. A gentle, warming (non-peat) smokiness builds in the back of the throat. Easily appreciable, eminently satisfying. Thanks as usual to the extemporaneous Pranay for the sample! Dry glass: dry malt."

4.0,"Finally,  some down time this weekend to take another, slow, quiet, whisky journey.  With a graciously Pranay-provided sample, the journey begins.

A lovely warming and rich (artificial?) amber/copper color begins stirring the imagination.  The nose is lovely and inviting with a sweet and fruity bouquet.  An eloquent sherry foundation with figs, raisins, brown sugar, and caramel apples.  Subtle notes of vanilla waft deep down along with dark chocolate, maple syrup, mixed nuts; predominantly pecans and walnuts.  These notes take time to arrive.  Be sure to be patient to get the full spectrum of aromas.  With a nose like this, the body must be just as complex.  (Vinyl record scratch…)  What?  Confusion! Double-take! The palate is not as varietal as the nose; surprisingly and extremely thin.  Not what I was expecting, given the nose.  The nutty flavors come through along with a touch of wood, vanilla, raisins and cinnamon spice.  And just as fast as the sip comes, it goes, fading to a short finish.  The palate is left with raspberries, oak and a bit of sugar and spice: vanilla, nutmeg, finally revealing a bit of orange zest.

A wonderful complex nose, deceiving in what comes forth, which is delivered in a somewhat simple and short-lived package.  Enjoyable? Yes. But I was looking/expecting more from this dram. I did find that the previous Cigar Malt (not this Reserve whisky) was richer, deeper and sweeter that had a long-lasting, maple syrupy finish and I recall liking that version more so than this version.  Additionally, the previous version could be found at ⅓ less the cost of the Reserve Cigar Malt.  I still would like to sample with a cigar to get the full experience.  That being said, Bushmills Black Bush works very well with a cigar.  Both have the same viscosity and both are Oloroso sherry influenced.  However, Black Bush is ~$100 cheaper. [Dry Glass: Honeysuckle, vanilla and damp earth][86/100][Tasted: 2/11/17]"

5.0,"As soon as you open the bottle, you can smell the oranges.   I especially love the color...elegant orange golden hue (probably coloring added? ).  The taste is rich and refined.  I'm getting oranges with honey.  Figs and chocolate.  Amazingly smooth.  I just had the Master of Malt Darkness Macallan 15 PX, and this one is by far better.  It's just more elegant.  I don't smoke, but if I did, I can see a Cigar going well with this.  The combination of oranges, honey, figs and chocolate is almost perfect.  Really good for the price, and a worthwhile treat to,replace dessert."

4.0,"I took this bottle with me to visit family in the mountains of West Virginia since I am including it with our upcoming fourth round of samples.  My dad has been encouraged to stop drinking by his doctor, so I figured I needed something very promising if I was going to convince him to imbibe with me one last time.

The Dalmore Cigar Malt Reserve is a re-release from Dalmore after lots of cries for them to bring it back.  This particular bottling contains undeclared aged malt from 3 different casks:  ex-American white oak bourbon, 30 year old Matusalem Oloroso sherry and Cabernet Sauvignon wine.  It’s bottled at a weird 44% ABV and is a beautiful orange/amber in the glass.  A quick spin produces slippery, but thick legs before settling back down.

After giving it 25-30 minutes to breathe it reveals some amazing vanilla, sherry and red raspberry notes that are laced with light smoke.  I envisioned what Macallan 18 or Rare Cask would smell like if it had a pronounced smoke layer.  It really draws you in and makes your mouth water.

The palate was hit or miss, IMO.  Heavy notes of vanilla, raisins and berries again that turn insanely hot and drying rather quickly.  It totally turns the nose, and amazing finish, on its head and keeps this one from being a near perfect dram for me.

Speaking of finish, it’s long with a hot burn (where I’d expect and appreciate it more).  There’s peppery notes and ginger spice that slowly fade back to everything I got on the initial nosing.  It starts and finishes exactly the same:  Mouth watering and luscious.

The unbalanced middle keeps this from being one of the greatest whiskies I’ve had to this point.  I get the feeling that cigar smokers get and enjoy that burning sensation thats present here on the palate and that’s ultimately what will make or break this one for them.  That feeling is lost on me a bit, but it’s still a solid and near-great dram.

Prices on this “rare-ish” malt have been steadily climbing.  I bought this one almost 2 years ago and paid roughly $110 for it.  I see it fetching $160-180 now and I’m not sure it’s worth that price.  I’ll be pouring samples of this one in less than a week and maybe when I revisit it it will have calmed a bit, as it was this afternoon I’d have to limit it to a solid 4-4.25 star dram.  It could’ve been perfect, I think, so that’s a little disappointing to me.  Cheers, my friends."

4.0,Enjoying this without a cigar is astounding. Reminds me of a smoke house aromas for fine meats etc. Greeting this is a pleasure to any Dalmore fan.

4.0,"Cheers to my good friend Lee for this sample. On the nose, sweetness takes shape with vanilla, caramel, cherries/sherry, and sweet tobacco. For the palate, darker fruits like blueberries, cigars, toffee, salted peanuts, and cashews. The finish is nice and long with some sulfuric notes on the back end. This is not the older original release which gets slightly higher marks I hear, and I'd love to try it. I'll give this a 4.0. The theme of this dram should be ""Smokin'"" by Boston."

4.0,That nose. 😬  After that it’s very tasty. Full with a black licorice finish with small sips.
4.0,"A bar midge (or an insect of some minute description) decided he had had enough of life and promptly committed Hari Kari in my dram. Wasn't sure if that was a good omen or not, like a bird pooping on your head (I once had a bird take a flying dump in my face, I bought a lotto ticket and didn't win so myth busted!). Anyhow after fishing it out the sampling commenced. Nose was faint caramel, sherry, toffee. Now I haven't had to strain quite as hard since last week when after one stodgy meal too many...anyhow I did get flavour and eventually it opened up (as far as a Dalmore ever will) and..  it was nice! Not $120USD nice I'll buy a bottle type thing but I like it. The nose translates to the palate, lovely viscosity, alcohol well balanced and if I hadn't given up smoking New Years Eve in Peru a decade ago (karma came back to bite me) I'd be reaching for a cigar. First Macallan now Dalmore aghh all my preconceptions are being shattered. Solid 4"

2.0,"Nose - Sharp sweet dried red fruits, vanilla simple, meaty/salty/savory mushroom funk

Taste - Rich red fruits, hints of banana, cinnamon heat, toffee/caramel sweet, savory salty grilled mushroom on the back palate

Finish - Light cinnamon spice heat, salty/savory umami notes, dried red berry sweet, lingering red berry waxy fruit snack sweet

Score - 65/100

Final Thoughts - So initial impression on the nose is that this is a nice pleasant red berry sweet, but then I get hit with this odd salty/savory meaty mushroomy funk. Threw me off a bit so I took a sip and same thing happened where I get this pleasant red berry, caramel sweetness that suddenly turns into this odd salty/savory mushroom funk. Same on the finish. Normally I enjoy sweet & savory notes, but for some reason this didn't really work together at all. It seemed very off balance and overly salty. I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle, but the cork seemed just fine.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.0,"The nose starts off with heavy fruit. Ripe banana bowls you over almost immediately, but in a way that you remember the smell of your mom’s home cooked banana bread. Adding in wafting vanilla and a slight milk chocolate close.  On the tongue, the fruit is consistent with the nose and silkily slips into its namesake tasting like the leaf of a cigar that you’ve held in your mouth too long before you light it. An anticipated oloroso finish that closes with a touch of ash that doesn’t show up until you’ve let the whole sip dissipate."

4.0,"After I reviewed the 12 year old I figured it was the perfect time to review my second ever Dalmore. The Cigar Malt Reserve... a name that just screams upper echelon and class. @LeeEvolved was kind enough to offer this as a bonus sample for this round of the SDT. 

This is a NAS expression that is matured in 70% Oloroso sherry casks, 20% ex bourbon and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon casks. Bottled at a peculiar 44% ABV, and like many other Dalmores, it is chill filtered and has colorant added. This is a dark amber or mahogany color. 

Deep dark sherry on the nose. Dark cherries and berries. A wonderful robust vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, toffee and caramel. Christmas cake, raisins and figs. More dark notes like maple syrup, more sherry, mocha, coffee. Fruity notes of tangerines and nectarines with a hint of licorice and menthol. Hazelnut, walnuts and dark chocolate. Some tobacco and a little new leather. A beautiful nose, but a little less complex than the 12 year old. 

The palate is not as strong as the nose would lead you to believe (which I hear as a complaint from many Dalmore reviews). Really nice sherry, even if it is a little on the weak side. Sherry oak, cinnamon, nutmeg, a little vanilla and some pepper. Raisins, Christmas cake and walnuts. Tasty, but again lacking in the necessary power to really drive all these flavors home. 

A medium-light bodied mouthfeel, oily and creamy and a joy to hold on the tongue. 
The finish is medium long with spices, oak and sherry. 

While I’m not really sure about pairing this with a cigar, a will say without a doubt that this is a very good scotch. Not as complex or elegant and the 12 year old, but the sherry flavors are stronger and fuller. Like the 12, I feel this should have been bottled at a higher strength. 48% seems fitting, but 46% should have been the minimum. I was in my favorite duty free shop a few weeks after reading Lee’s review and saw a 1L bottle sitting on the shelf gathering a fine layer of dust. I grabbed it along with their travel retail exclusive bottle Valour. The CMR cost me $153, but again that’s for a full liter. While I feel that’s about $53 too high, I still bought it. Thanks again to Lee for the sample. Maybe I will experiment with a cigar and a dram of this in the future. 4.25. 
Cheers"

4.0,"I'm loading up notes from a Dalmore vertical tasting last week, and this whisky was the clear winner of the night.  Cigar Malt is Richard Paterson’s take on an ideal scotch-and-cigar pairing.  It is a noticeably meatier, punchier dram, with more spice notes that modulate its sweetness.  Everything about this makes sense, as its notes would stand up to a cigar, and even its flaws may help it not be overpowered in that cigar lounge-style setting.  A bunch of ethanol vapor needs time to waft off, but once it’s gone, a rich caramel settles in.  This is a spicy scotch, akin to Big Red gum, with more caramel and sherry accompaniment.  The finish exhibits a mild sherry tinge, some tobacco leaf, and sharp cinnamon.  It’s not complex, but it has backbone.  That being said, I'm persistently aggravated by the low ABVs that all of these Dalmore bottlings feature; this dram, at 48-52%, would be much more impressive and would probably be a better cigar companion."

4.0,"Whisk(e)y: The Dalmore  - Cigar Malt Reserve

Nose:

Out of the current Dalmore fleet on the market, the Cigar Malt has a funky nose to it. One would think it shouldn’t belong in the line up, but since it is so particular and differentiates itself among its brethren, I actually dig it. 

I get figs and leather on the nose. After a few swirls in the glencairn and nosing again I can sense sherry and raisins. A good combo. 
 
Palate:

 A small release of fruit and subtleness of smoke. The fruit reminds me of mango which is after nosing and swirling for a few moments along with 2-3 small sips. No heat on the tongue which is odd since this is a 44% abv. Then again, if you’re a heavy hitter for abv’s you will find this a walk in the park. Also, with a pinch of vanilla finish on this dram particularly, I find that it makes for a smooth transition of nose to palate based on the mechanics of how this one was built.

Overall: 

I dig this one. After having a few drams on different occasions I am always drawn back to how it differentiates itself without sacrificing quality. A well constructed dram. Very intriguing nose but also provides a pinch of challenge to anyone testing the different drams in their line up. 

Next review – King Alexander III. Cheers peeps!"

then tried it with a punch cigar and enjoyed it more. the profile mellowed some flavors and brought out others. the emptiness of the initial taste developed into a smooth flavor and balanced the sherry. it might have been subconscious, or the 4 glasses of scotch before, but I liked this better when pairing it with a cigar.

sadly, it is definitely overpriced. a decent scotch but not a bottle I will ever buy again."

3.5,"Spending time in Naples, FL and decided to spring for this since I found it for $20 less than up north.  Priced at $160+ in the Boston area, couldn’t quite get myself to bite despite our weekly cigar gathering. Really enjoyed an earlier sample of Dalmore 18 (4.25 stars) provided by my buddy and whisky guru, @LeeEvolved , so I was hoping for a similar experience that didn’t quite materialize. The whisky does maintain it’s integrity during a light, but that’s “neither here nor there” as Shakespeare once wrote. You still need to like the pour. The nose is a little muted, but satisfactory. Certainly not what I would describe as elegant. The sherry, vanilla, and spices are obvious but not uplifting enough to produce a smile. The palate picks things up a bit with raisins, almonds, cinnamon, and sweet orange peel predominating, but then things flatten out again in the finish. The Oloroso provides an overly dry ending that’s a little flat and bitter. One might hope the Cabernet cask enhancer to provide a sweet pop to counterbalance, but such was not the case. A good pour but not rising to the 4 star level for me. 3.50 stars."
4.0,"Delicious, rich and raisiny. I don’t smoke cigars but I can see how this would pair beautifully. Smooth but not too smooth, they didn’t over age this so all the character is gone. Yummy.  Tasted with @pkplatypus around my kitchen table on a Saturday afternoon."

4.75,"One of our local liquor stores accidentally got small 100 ml bottles of this whiskey.

I want a full size bottle of this magical elixir.

The best part for me was the nose. Brown sugar, toffee and chocolate caramels dominate the scent. It's kind of like the smell of a family owned candy shop hidden just off the beaten path.

The taste is even more of an elegant candy shop than the nose. I got heath bar, roasted pecans, butterscotch pudding with a bit of salt, and buttery Belgian waffles. (I think I'm making myself hungry.)

The finish just gets better. It's creamy a sweet kind of like creme brulee with fresh pralines. There is also an odd, but very subtle smoke, kind of like incense.

Once the finish was done I wanted more. I wonder how this would pair with deserts?"

2.5,"What is this? There is a lot of depth, but also a lot of cherry. The smoke and bits of peat pervade everywhere, but do not overtake the Sherry flavor. There is a lot going on, but the Sherry is overwhelming. Some herbal notes and spices are here too, with cinnamon and mint being the most prominent flavors. Some mild chocolate and mushroom notes come out too, but simply having a lot of flavors does not make for a good drink. The flavors conflict to a distressing extent, so I'm sure glad I didn't buy a whole bottle. This is an interesting and unique drink, but not one I would like to drink regularly. To some extent, it reminds me of a less balanced Symbole National mixed into some scotch."

5.0,This might be the most complex scotch I've ever tasted. Every sip displays something else that's new and delicious. It's also the perfect proof to be supremely enjoyable.
