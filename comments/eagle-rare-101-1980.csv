4.0,"The color is a deep reddish amber and with a swirl it coats the glass in legs that cling to the sides of the glass and never leave. The nose starts with floral rye, sweet molasses, charred oak, brown sugar and cinnamon infused vanilla. The palate has a pleasant mustiness to it while what you got on the nose subtlety introduces itself with just a touch of rye spiciness, charred oak, vanilla and cinnamon, with brown sugar and molasses offering the smallest hint of sweetness. The finish is medium with a lingering cinnamon spiciness with fading oak and vanilla. The palate could stand to live up a bit more to what you sense on the nose, with the flavors all being there but a touch too subtle. Despite this, it still makes for a great sipper."
