3.0,"Nose - Sharp vanilla/corn syrup sweet, oaky cinnamon, cloves, alcohol soaked oak.

Taste - Sweet spicy vanilla simple mixed with corn syrup, cinnamon spice, tannic oaky dryness, thin caramel, hint of cloves, hint of oaky bitterness.

Finish - Lingering vanilla simple/corn syrup, hint of cinnamon spice, creamed corn sweet.

Score - 76/100

Final Thoughts - This was a bit strange in that the nose seemed to have 2 parts, the first was an initial wave of super sweet clean vanilla, followed by this oaky afterbite. This seemed to follow a bit on the palate as well as I get somewhat classic bourbon notes, but it's followed by this pretty intense corn syrupy sweet that I kind of got from Mellow Corn. I'm not sure I really like the balance of this as it has this ""too sweet"" vibe and a mouthfeel of what I imagine oak aged vodka would have. Flavors aren't horrible, but not great. I think it's just a bit confusing to the palate.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe, if there weren't better options.

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.75,"I've brought you batch 18 so now lets go back 6 batches to batch 12. 

Nose - Very light, vanilla, cream, touch of oak, touch of caramel. There's a bit of oak spice at the end.

Taste - A light toasted bourbon with focuses on sweetness, really bringing me back to a lot of the notes I get on say a well full proof or CYPB. It's that highly inviting and welcoming bourbon that I think has become out of hand popular. This one brings in some age and some refinement that makes me start thinking about the van winkles. Now, I'm virtually positive this isn't a wheated anything, and I don't taste wheat but it is that mellow and relaxed yet highly enjoyable balance here that I'm more focused on. I get some bubble gum notes, some kinda of puffed sugar, and just a touch of leather. 

Honestly, I'm not sure I'm getting 12+ year old bourbon here, but at the same time, I'm 100% sure I'm getting whisky that with a buffalo trace logo on it, would sell for 500+ secondary. 

So batch 18 vs 12? 

18 is bolder, spicier, less refined, the finish is longer with sparks and bitter notes coming through. They do share similar flavor profiles as I get the creams and lighter vanilla notes, and perhaps say a hint of a vanilla wafer. The batch 12 is that van winkle refined whisky, the 18 is a store pick of weller 107, less refined, but still good. 

If you like a bit of punch get the newer batches. If you are looking for that refined ultra high end bourbon experience without a CS note, I think these older bottles will do it for you.

I don't know when Nancy had to start using higher proof barrels but I do think something changed pretty materially between batch 12 and 18. 

As a whisky connoisseur I would be hard pressed side by side to not tell you the batch 12 is a superior product. I however as a whisky drinker think a lot more bourbon geeks might lean towards this 18. I gave the 18 a 3.25 which is a great score and this one has to come in at 3.75. The amount of refinement while bringing in some older whisky notes really to me pushes this one up in terms of overall quality, but for those who aren't looking for a bookers punch but still need a bit of a kick, batch 18 might be more your jam.

Watch Nancy tell me batch 12 and 18 are basically the same and that I'm a fool. Either way, I'm a happy camper with the batch 12 while the batch 18 left me feeling something was off."

2.0,"Nose - Standard notes of oak, vanilla, and cinnamon. Also a fair amount of ethanol. It's kind of the standard MGP bourbon nose, only hotter and more astringent.

Palate is thin and hot. There's some oak and and lots of spice, but it's just lacking in richness. Finish drops off before even hitting the back palate, the only thing that lingers a bit is the astringency.

I should have done a little more due diligence before buying this, but I like everything else I've had from Joseph Magnus so I just bought it. Turns out it's a blended bourbon, not a blend of straight bourbons. Big difference, as this stuff is actually 30% light whiskey. 

If this were a $30 dollar bottle I might be a little more generous with my score. But considering the $90-100 price and the misleading label, I feel this really deserves a harsh score. Heck, I have $30 store picks of Elijah Craig Small Batch that are better than this stuff.

Bottom line, if you're looking to splurge on a bottle, go for the Joseph Magnus triple-cask for the same price, this one just isn't worth it."

4.0,A bit hotter than last year 2018. However the nose is a bit more subtle.
3.25,"This review is of batch 18. Would be nice if Nancy could pop in an let us know if anything has changed for this batch. 

Nose - So my first impression is that this is overly sweet, almost too much and almost getting into aspartame levels. I do still get a nice bit of oak, vanilla, caramel...it is a very traditional bourbon note and very on profile for a bit of a generic bourbon. That said it is amped up to 10, it's intense nosing, there's far more intense sweetness than a 103 proof bourbon should provide. Still, I can't really give high praise on nose alone, it's good.

Taste - This is not the bourbon I remember from my first bottle. You definitely get that there is some older whisky in here. Adding water really helped this one. So with water you start to get some of the sweeter note but some fruity flavors are coming out too. I'm getting a hint of tobacco as I go. This is complex without anything jumping out and over powering the overall rich sweet aged bourbon profile.

This is classic bourbon. It isn't nutty, it isn't chocolate, it isn't cinnamon, no mineral notes, no over the top oak. It is those vanillas, caramels, corn, and yes there's an oak note here but it's just classic bourbon oak. It's old enough, there isn't a lot of a ""hug"" or a bite but it's got a really good mouth feel and great proof. 

So I'm at a 3.25. A very very sold offering, a bit expensive, but the quality is here. There is a hint of a bitter finish that pushes me from 3.5 to the 3.25. I think the last bottle I had was pushing 4.0."
4.25,"N: Sweet vanilla
P: Creamy butterscotch that builds to a cinnamon creciendo
F: Warm, long and dry with that right about if barrel char"
