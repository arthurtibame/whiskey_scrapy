4.25,Another fantastic creation from Chris Morris! Very easy to drink with complexity that shows up more and more as you drink. If this mash bill was able to mature long. It would be the best product at WR. I really think they are on to something.

2.0,This isn't good and would skip it.  It lacks depth and flavor.  You taste grains and a little bitterness.  Very similar in flavor to Woodford Reserve Master Collection Classic Malt.
2.0,"An interesting comparison to the sour mash normally used. Personally, I found the sweet mash less complex and less and enjoyable, but definitely worth a try if for no other reason than to see how much of a difference the set back makes to the distilling process"
3.0,Interesting but I felt it was far inferior to Double Oak personally.
4.0,My favorite of the Distillery Series.
