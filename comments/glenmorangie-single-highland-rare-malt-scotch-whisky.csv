3.75,"I've had this in my cabinet since the later 1990s. Light floral nose and light yellow color. Light non-viscous body, sweet grain, fruit, and vanilla in the mouth. light peat. My tastes changed to smokier peatier scotches, hence why I still have this. Clean and easy to drink, a classic highland,  but not particularly memorable."
