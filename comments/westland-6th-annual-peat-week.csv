4.75,"A smokey, savory powerhouse that dominates every sense from nose, palate to finish. Classic peaty nose, not so much brine or medicinal scents from the likes of Laphroaig, but a more earthy smoke. Palate is predominantly savory and envelops the entire mouth. The finish is intense and long lasting as a red hot tingle. So so good."
