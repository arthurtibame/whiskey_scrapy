4.25,"I love this distillery.  All their products are unique and challenge my palette. This is no exception
    
 Batch 1, 42.5% ABV:  Nose is light caramel/honey, mild hay, and cocoa.  Taste starts with the cocoa powder, hazelnut, honey, then getting more tannic on the back of the tongue with tea, wood, tobacco, cocoa, and light sweetness.  Medium dry finish.
    
Delicately complex and earns a spot on the shelf for the unique combination of flavors.  

Definitely worth picking up if you're looking for something different"
