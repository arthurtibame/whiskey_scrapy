3.75,"light floral nose. sweet cereal and flowers, even honey, but very light and clean finish. little smoke and subtle wood. very different; unique single malt, not to be compared to peated scotches. worth a taste for the floral nature."

3.25,No 3 on the tasting list. The peat comes across as younger iodine and rubber. Usually it'd be up my alley but they don't pull it off that well. A younger thinner Laphroaig...it is a progress statement though so time will tell.
