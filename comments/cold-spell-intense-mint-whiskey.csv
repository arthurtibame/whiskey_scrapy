2.25,Obviously not amazing as whiskey but as a mixer it can be great. Really strong mint.
0.5,"The Mojito, the Mint Julep, the Whiskey Smash, even the Grasshopper. Mint and alcohol is a time tested combination sure to please, so when I purchased my most recent bottle and asked the man behind the counter if he had any interesting tasters, I was intrigued by the idea of Cold Spell Intense Mint Whiskey. I am normally not a fan of flavored whiskey and I must say...this is no exception.

The nose is a bouquet of Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Dual Blast and a fine vintage of Listerine Cool Mint. It smells more like a dentist office than a whiskey. The palate has a mint that is far from intense, no mention of alcohol, and an amount of sugar rivaling only Pixy Stix. If you are looking for a mouthwash that is unjustifiably expensive and sure to cause cavities instead of preventing them, this may be the product you are looking for. If, however, flavored whiskey is your thing, then I wholeheartedly encourage you to renounce the citizenship of whichever country you call home and become a lonely hermit on a desert island. We don't need your kind here."

The nose is mint toothpaste. The flavor is weak whiskey, sweetness, and a reasonably balanced amount of mint. I really expected this to be “MINT!!!” but it is more “mint”."
