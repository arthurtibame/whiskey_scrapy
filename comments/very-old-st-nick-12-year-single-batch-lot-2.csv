5.0,Mind blown
4.75,"This is fantastic and really complex for the proof. Nice wheated nose, a little heat upfront with a moderately dry wood, tart finish. Unfortunately not much info on this bottle other than VanWinkle family produced them sourced. So Easy, Weller 12+

Update: halfway through this bottle And it continues to grow on me. Tasted again tonight after a pour of some more oaky bourbons (GTS 19 and Cream of Kentucky B1) and I picked up notes of  strawberries and cream and less oak than previously, although my pallet might be blown from the higher proofs. Still really digging this"
4.25,Really good kind of a strange finish almost Tastes like peanut butter
4.5,"Vibrant nose with citrus with a fruity, very slightly spicy finish"
