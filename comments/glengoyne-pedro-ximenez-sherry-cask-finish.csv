4.25,Great sherry with a touch of bourbon and citrus
4.25,"NOSE: It balances strong sulphuric notes with sharp spices and soft dark fruits. Pinch of salt. I think it nails it. It’s powerful at 46%. No peat but there’s a charcoal element there. Balanced yet complex.

PALATE: Matches the strong nose with powerful flavors. Candied ginger. Gingerbread. Ends on warming sweet ceylon cinnamon. There’s a transition from spicy to sweet and back to spicy.

OVERALL: First Glengoyne but I’m immediately buying the “slow” concept. It just feels like something made with care."
