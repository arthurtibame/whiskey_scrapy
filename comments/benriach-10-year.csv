3.0,"This whisky has that ""hidden gem"" appeal, as if you had to climb down three flights of stairs into an old cellar hidden for centuries  somewhere in the Scottish highlands. Perhaps I'm romanticizing it a bit - but what is alcohol without its historical, celestial allure? Now, how does it hold up? The thing that interests me most is the contrast between nose and palate: it smells like peaches and cream, almost floral but nonetheless very innocent, but it's very sharp and rebellious in its taste. Think green apples and pepper. Not really a whisky to own or to call your favorite, but definitely to try a dram if you stumble upon a (home) bar that has it."
3.0,"Spices and barley malt nose, smooth, mild. Smooth palate, spicy, peppery finish."

4.0,"BenRiach is not as well known as some of its Speyside peers, but perhaps it should be.  On the nose, I get stone fruit, like peach, sherry, toffee, and a little hint of ethanol.  It is an easy-drinking scotch, with a slightly nutty, sherry-influenced palate, a few streaks of oak and cocoa, and an almost ale-like richness or spiciness.  BenRiach 10 ends with a malty finish of good length, with just a little bitterness, copper, and sulfur, but also more pleasant notes of cocoa, citrus acid, and grape.  This scotch reminds me of a dilute Aberlour A'bunadh, and is better than Glenfarclas 12.  It also comes in a peated version, which I'm looking forward to trying.  Thanks to Telex for the sample!"
3.0,"I am more into Islay whisky, but I kept hearing great things about this dram.  It goes down well, nice and complex.  It's not my wheelhouse and a bit pricey, but I hold on to a bottle as one to offer friends who have decent taste.  I also get to keep them away from my Islay stash at the same time. Win-win."

3.75,Light peat. Earthy. Light amber. Smoke. Light band aid.
3.5,"Nez: Sherry, fruit sec. Semble doux au nez.

Bouche: effectivement doux et fruité. des fruits rouges. C'est vraiment comme le Glendronach 12 sans les épices et avec 3% de moins. Peu complexe.

Finale: Courte.

Overall: C'est bon en bouche mais pas de wow ici. Un bon petit scotch sur le sherry qui se trouve à quelque part entre le Macallan Amber et le Glendronach 12. Content d'y avoir gouté. C'est un scotch de soirée tranquille. 71%"

3.0,A tad too sweet and sort of lacks identity or at least distinct traits.  I am left with the overall impression of a lemon poppyseed muffin.  Good but not usually what I want in a whiskey.  Price is ok for a 10 year but I wouldn’t say it’s great value.

3.75,"Nose: Lemon zest, cinnamon, vanilla, creamy frosting. 
Palate: Brown sugar, caramel, cream
Finish: Fried bananas, vanilla, pepper, coffee

Lemon cupcakes on the nose and a bit like a overly sweet caramel coffee milkshake on the taste and finish."
3.5,"Along the lines of a Macallan 12 but not as nuanced or smooth. Got a 96 rating at Wine Enthusiast...don't know why. Solid enough, a bit high priced for  10yo but if you're going to savor a scotch, it might as well be more top shelf."

3.0,"A very fragrant nose, honey quickly overtaken by green apples, pear, vanilla and plenty of malty goodness. On the palate, green apples, spicy, with a touch of brine and white pepper, a walnut bitterness with the sherry influence appearing the longer the whisky breathes. A short finish, those apples disappearing, dusted cocoa, cinnamon, oak, a little tannic and just a dash of pepper."

1.75,"A preponderance of alcohol in the nose; I'm giving myself a head rush.  Melds into mineral spirits, with a hint of fruit/honey and sulphur. Overall, not pleasant.

Initially fruity to the taste. The pepper kicks in after a few seconds and stays throughout.  The taste is of imitation fruit, chemical-ly. 

The aftertaste leaves quickly except for a slightly queasy feeling.

This bottle loses it's place in the collection, relegated to the back cabinet for mixed drinks."
3.5,"Friendly and approachable single malt. Orchard fruits and blossoms on the nose.  Hints of yellow pears and green apples on the sweet and thin palate.  Mild finish that doesn't stick around for very long, just enough to prompt you for the next drink."
4.0,"Smoky and sweet on the nose, reminding me of an Islay but with less of an earthiness or brine note. On the taste, though, it becomes evident that this is different. It’s sweet and honey along with smoke. Smooth and really nice."
3.5,"Hard to describe. Pretty smooth, but lingering alcohol taste a bit. Slight smoke, slight sweetness, and maybe a little subtle sour."

3.5,"Nose: Cereal forward and fresh, with barley malt supported by lemon and apricot. There's a pleasant fat oiliness to the aroma, and as it rests and unfolds the fragrance of cinnamon and ginger boiled sweets arises. There's also a prominent sweet musky note.
            
Palate: Oily and creamy, very full and sweet (but not cloying at all) but somewhat unfocused. As it develops there are sweet nutty flavours (hazelnut? almond?), some citrus zest and a dominant honey-malt character. Some mild sweet/spicy cereal notes like seed cake supporting it all.
            
Finish: Short. Slightly spicy and malty with a touch of white pepper in the finale.
            
I liked the nose on this a lot. It's both approachable but also complex and it has an elusive floral character (but it's not what I'd call a ""floral whisky""). However with a dash of water the sweet musky character disappears and the nose becomes weak cereal/citrus in nature.
            
The palate is good, but not as notable as the nose, and it lacks a solid foundation. There is a melange of sweet, oily and slightly spicy flavours but it's rather mild and a bit generic. It gave me the impression that it did not know what sort of whisky it was supposed to be. Imagine a mixture of Aberlour A'bunadh and Springbank 10 that was then mixed 50/50 with neutral grain spirit.

Any amount of dilution kills the palate stone dead - this is a gentle, delicate whisky - almost fragile - and it drowns at the mere sight of water. I strongly recommend taking it neat.
            
""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

3.0,"N: Sweet with Sherry notes and candied fruit not rich but also light, faint Briny quality(very muted)

P: milk chocolate, medium spiciness, stewed fruits, mellows as its chewed and becomes rounder. Typical Sherry note come through after several sips (~3)

F: Sweet, fruity, malted chocolate, smooth, medium length ☹️

Great entry scotch. Wish Sherry played a larger role on finish...personal bias. Would buy for guests or as a shelf whiskey for playing around with in Cocktails. 2 drops in about a 1/2 Oz pour make all the difference in opening it up.

Worth the buy or try if available at a bar or on sale at local store. Personal retail around 40usd."

3.75,"Tasted neat in a glencairn. Pour is a light golden yellow.  Very delicate nose, honey & florals & slight ethanol. Definite apples, light pears, dry grass. 

On the tongue this is sweet, creamy, creme brulee, toffee, slight white pepper. There are notes of oak barrel and lumberyard. 

The finish takes its time. Not a lot of spice, but a lot of glow. 

This is subtle & delicious."

3.75,"Perhaps it’s because I’ve been on a bit of an Irish whiskey kick lately but the first thing I thought of when I tasted this was that it tasted like an Irish. Maybe it’s the pale straw color or the heavy cereal and vanilla nose and taste profile. Then the sherry shows up...definitely not an Irish. But it’s a bit muted telling you it’s not a speyside sherry bomb either. Then some heat comes along for the ride through the relatively short finish. I’d say in the end it’s unique enough. Not sure I’d buy another bottle but I’ll enjoy the one I just opened. And I’ll definitely move up the range with interest as this is said by many to be one of the weaker expressions from this distillery. 

Update: upon re-tasting the balvenie single barrel I think I may have found my comp for this. On balance I prefer the balvenie but similar sour elements are present and both turn very sweet with a bit of water."
