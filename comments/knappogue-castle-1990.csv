2.0,"This was a 2oz sample from the 1993 vintage.  It was given to me by an online retailer after there was an error with an order I placed.  

This is pale yellow in color and is very watery in the Glencairn.  The nose is weak vanilla and barley, with faint oak sustaining the backbone.  The palate is smooth and slightly sweet.  Candied corn, vanilla and a little warm.  The finish is quick with no burn.  Very smooth.

Overall, there’s nothing exciting here.  It’s smooth and a little sweet and would probably be well hidden in any cocktail you need some whiskey for.  There’s no need to drink this neat.  There’s also no need to buy a bottle.  2-2.5 stars.  Cheers."
