3.5,"A nice balance of peat and sweet, with a spicy sweet finish. For the price point I’d say this is a good intro to light peat and sherry."
4.0,Hidden gem and under appreciated. One of the best isly whisky for this price. I would put this up against expressions twice the price. Love the this whisky and gets better as the bottle goes down and down. Always replace this as soon as it’s gone.

4.0,"Well, time for a new tasting. Been holding off for a while because I started to react badly to any kind of alcohol for a while (bad heartburn, no fun), but that got better, so I can finally start enjoying whisky again. Didn't even get a drink on my birthday earlier this month. 

But, since today is kind of a second birthday (the anniversary of my surgery), and I'm in a great mood (down exactly 170lbs in one year), I decided to grab a classic scotch. And discovered that I don't have many of those left in my samples...mostly Rum these days. But I got the Bunna 12, and man, that was a nice choice. 

On the nose it starts very scottish. Honey, salt, a surprising dose of roasted hazelnuts, some buttery biscuits (that I usually associate more with irish stuff, but it is there) and a fruity raisin note. Very nice start. 

The taste is a bit weird. Salt and smoky char up front, but the softer notes break through after a bit. Honey, caramel, dried fruits and even a hint of dark chocolate. So far, so good. What I didn't expect was a very strong bitterness. Oak maybe? Almost hoppy...IPA level intense. That almost ruined it for me, not a huge fan of bitter, but the rest of the notes kept in check enough for me to still be able to enjoy it. 

Aftertaste is a bittersweet and warming combination that lasts a decent amount of time. 

Was a bit torn on how to rate this, what bumped it up to a 4.0 is the price. It's about the price level of a HP12 or Talisker 10 these days, and in that price range, it is actually on the more complex side. And if you like bitter, you might enjoy this one even more. 

Now that I have a baseline for Bunna, there are a couple more samples that I want to try. Soon(tm)."

Experience: a candy store in an old town. If you've ever been to Europe especially France you'll know. It's old and nutty and salty and chocolatey and old but, it is so good. Maybe it is the place, maybe the history, or perhaps it really was better the ""old way"". Whatever the case it's good and let's not mess with that."

4.75,"Thought I would try and give some notes (first attempt at this)

The Nose: Sweet dark fruit, sherry, vanilla, honey

The Taste: Complex, dark fruit, anise, sweet, vanilla, spicy prickling of my tongue and maybe some hints of peat

The finish: long, honey, anise, dryness and maybe hints of peat.

Final thoughts: Islay whisky with very low ppm of 5, a really great whisky with no color or chill filtering at 46,3% ABV. I am placing this in my top 5 so far! Will be buying this one again in the near future."
4.5,"Bunnahabhain 12, Islay, 95 pts. Very sweet, maple-smoked ham, figgy pudding, butterscotch and a little little earthy peat to round it out. Exceptionally smooth, full body and an easy drinker. I like the light smoke with the sweetness."

P: Very rich dessert flavors of fruit pies, toffee, peppermint bark. There is some cinnamon and ginger spiciness.

F: Sweet, rich, and slightly fatty smokiness of candied nuts. 

If you wanted creme brulee with the toasted sugary crust, but didn't know how to cook, this would be a reasonable substitute."

If I were given this in a blind tasting I’d swear it was from the highlands, not Islay. Lots of malty notes with a short finish and a nip from the proof. Not a bad dram by any measure, and good for the rainy night I consumed it, but I wanted more, and if your going for Islay, there are far superior options. 

If you’re looking for a truly magical Islay malt that is unpeated, I much prefer the Classic Laddie."

4.0,"I bought a miniature of this classic Islay single malt a while ago and it got lost in the madness of my sample backlog. After reading some favorable reviews I decided it’s time to move it to the front of the line. Bunnahabhain is the northernmost distillery on Islay and they are the least peated as well (unless you consider their heavily peated line) at 3ppm. This 12 year old is bottled at 46.3% ABV, non chill filtered and natural color of amber honey. It’s a blend of about 70/30 bourbon/sherry casks. 

The nose has a quick hit of alcohol followed by a wave of butterscotch. It’s very grassy as well. Bourbon soaked oak chips and some dark sherry. A very light peat and wood spice, cloves, nutmeg and allspice, herbal. Very rich, chocolate sauce, raisins, vanilla, pancake syrup and salted caramels. Mineral notes, chalky, also some orange oil and olive brine. A touch malty at the bottom of the glass with more caramel and cinnamon. 

The palate begins peppery, sweet and savory. A big thick sherry richness with chocolate sauce, raisins, heavy oak. Fairly bitter, oak tannins and walnut skins. Ginger and clove. Vanilla, toffee, salted caramels and root beer. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is oily and creamy, very mouthwatering. 
The finish is long with sherry oak, slightly sour and bitter, chocolate and vanilla with a trace of peat, dry. 

Solid flavors here, indicative of quality casks and skilled blending of the bourbon and sherry matured components. The bitterness on the palate does hurt things, but otherwise this is a very good single malt, though I think I prefer the heavily peated versions better. 3.75-4
Cheers"

Nez: Lingerie fraichement lavé. Lavande. Brise fraiche. Sel. Je crois apercevoir le sherry quelque part dernière caché dans un coin. 

Bouche: Belle texture en bouche. Belle intensité. Petite fumé, sucre de Coca, cerise noir, sel et sirop de table. Ce melange de fumé et de sherry me rappel le Coca-cola. Me rappelle le Highland Park Dark Origin pour ses notes de sherry de fumé et de sel. 

Final: C'est frais. C'est frais et pétillant. Sur ce sherry-salé-fumé-Coca-Cola.

Workthrough the bottle: La fumé tant à disparaître avec l'oxydation. Le fruité de l'ex-bourbon prend le dessus sur le fruité du sherry. C'est le genre de bouteille à ne pas laissé trop longtemps ouverte dans son armoire. Il nécessite peut-être une semaine d'oxydation pour atteindre son niveau de complexité optimal de façon explicite. 

Overall: C'est un bon scotch. Mais, je peux pas dire que je suis à terre comme beaucoup on mentionné l'être. C'est bon certes mais, je ne pourrais dire qu'il est meilleur ou moins bon que le HP DO. Le genre de whisky que j'apprécie et que je comprends pourquoi plusieurs l'apprécie plus que moi. Mais, pour ma part, ça reste un jeu de Sel-Sherry et légère fumé qui s'équilibre ""trop"". Donnez-moi du caractère! Quelque chose de spéciale qui se démarque et qui me fait dire wow! Si je veux une fumé sur une pointe de Sherry, j'irais avec le Amrut Fusion qui est capable de me démontrer une intensité plus acceptable du haut de ses 50%. Finalement, c'est juste une question de palette de gout personnelle et d'intensité aromatique. 79%"

Nose: Some kind of nut, or nutty malt. Something I can’t place but I don’t like, kind of like bad molasses or butterscotch I don’t necessarily want to eat. Sweet, maybe it’s more sherry than I like? There’s a smokiness if you go slowly and can find it. The nose does not have me looking forward to drinking it.
Taste: Water certainly wakes it up if you add it. Better than the nose, while I’m not in love with the, my concerns from the nose melt away quickly. It tastes like a somewhat harsh butter made from whatever nuttiness is in the nose. I think the unappealing part is the sherry, it tastes like caramel that is off, and I suspect I need a good amount of peat to enjoy the sweet sherry influence, or sweetness in general. I was able to find a subtle not of rosewater when mentioned I was drinking this and Ralfy mentioned it, but not if it wasn’t on my radar from that.

Finish is medium, with more fruit and oak notes, finishing with a slight bitterness and a hint of figs.

4.25,"For my first review in some time, I figured I'd try something a little different. This is my first (nearly) unpeated Islay. I've had some great experiences with peated Highland/Speyside Scotches, now it's time to flip the script.

Nose: Sherry notes jump out of the glass. I get both white and red grape, raisin, date, cranberry, and fig. I'm also getting orange and caramel. Big toffee note and a bit of baking spice. Honey, graham cracke, sandlewood. A healthy dose of oak at the end. The profile falls in line with a sherry/bourbon cask aged highland malt.

Palate: Orange peel and those red sherry notes of cranberry, fig, date, and raisin. More grape and now there's some pear. Vanilla, caramel, and toffee. Much spicier than the nose suggested; black pepper and clove. Oak note coming presented as bitter chocolate. Similar notes to the nose, although the spice is now equal to the sweetness and bitterness. If you told me there was no peat at all, I'd believe you.

Finish: Best part of the whisky. A slice of rich chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The red fruit/orange/grape notes remain present before it transitions to black pepper and cinnamon to the conclusion of a moderate length finish. Great stuff here.

I know full well that there is a bit of peat here, but I will admit that I don't even pick up a trace. Perhaps my palate isn't up for the task, but I'm detecting nothing remotely characteristic of the Islay region.

And yet, that's not a bad thing. Bunna 12 does quite well for what it is. Respectable age statement, quality barrels, appropriately proofed. And on sale for $50 (down from $55) it's a damn good value.

Approachable enough for the novice, complex enough to satisfy a seasoned drinker. What's not to like here? It's a rich, well-balanced malt that demonstrates that the Islay region is capable of producing much more than the peat bombs I've come to expect. Highly recommended. Well done, Bunna."

4.5,"Continuing with high quality Islay single malts this is unpeated( well a small amount 5ppm or so) and sherry finished. Most are peat and smoke dominant so this was a must try. Its un chill-filtered with natural color which is a plus imo. Poured neat, rich dark color with sticky legs. Noses deep dark fruits, sugared figs and dates, very meaty. Slight earthy malt note. I find the sherry finish very prominent. Oily thick mouthfeel leads palate of pure malt with sherry fruit notes. Has just a touch of smoke and sweet wood. Comes across silky, soft and subtle but is complex and intriguing. You want that next sip to continue exploring. Flavor is just dripping off your taste buds. The finish on this is fabulous, very long with sweet oak and malt and a smoky coffee note( I think small amounts of peat cause this). Alcohol burn is non existent as this is buttery smooth. Doesn't have the powerhouse flavor delivery of a Bruichladdich but has a lot going on with so much flavor and great depth. Sort of a ""speak softly and carry a big stick"" situation. It wont smack you in the face but will creep up on you until you realize that wow this stuff is amazing! I would lean toward Classic Laddie however this is an easy purchase and certain keeper. I paid $50 on sale and feel I got great value!........94/100........If you appreciate scotch you should try this......elegant and sophisticated"

3.75,"Wow, how does this have an 84 on Distiller? I really enjoy this whisky. It checks all the boxes: inexpensive (check), stronger abv (46.3, check), non-chill filtered (check), no coloring (check). It has a lot going on for a young Islay. It is not heavily peated which is nice but has a very slight touch of spicy smoke maybe. It is fruity, nutty and smells very nice. When you hold it on your tongue its like a little explosion of flavors. I get a lot of citrus and brine. The finish is easy and malty. I am a fan. This is how whisky should be. I wish that everyone would go the no-coloring and no-chill filtering way (Hello Diageo). This is working its way into my regular rotation."

Nose: Cherry Twizzlers, Apple, caramel

Taste: There’s the peat! Wow. It changes the whole time. There’s fudge and sugar and grass and smoke and I’m SO happy. Dang. Drink this."

3.25,"When I first decided to dive into Scotch whisky I knew I would find myself with some Islay malts sooner or later. Now I’ve definitely dove head first and tried Lagavulin and Laphroaig(reviews to come), but I’ve often read Bunnahabhain is a great place to start for novice whisky drinkers wanting a taste of Islay. Picked up this mini from FineDrams online(the local mini options are few and far between). It’s another non chill-filtered whisky and has no coloring added. It is bottled at 46.3% which for an accessible 12y is quite nice. Poured the mini into my copita and rested around ten minutes giving it a few smells here and there. It’s got a lovely straw and golden hue to it.

Nose: One of the first things that hit my nose is some brine and salt, not overwhelmingly so but it’s there. There’s a lot of sweetness as well, perhaps some dried fruits. It’s a pleasant nose but definitely one of the more subdued of the whiskies I’ve tried thus far. After sitting a while longer some smoke, just the faintest hint of it comes out as well.

Palate: This whisky definitely has more to offer when you take a sip compared to the nose. Lovely dried fruits and a bit of brine mingle with the subtle smoke(more prevalent in the taste than the nose). A bit of spice and oak but overall it’s quite bright, not musty or heavy.

Finish: The finish right around the middle on this whisky. It leaves you with some sticky malty sweetness and a touch of smoke that fades away. There’s a bit more oak and spice toward the end as well.

Value/Overall Opinion: A fine malt that I would gladly drink again. I have to 100% agree that this is a great foray into a touch of smoke and what Islay has to offer for the uninitiated. This is definitely what I would call a “daily drinkable” type of whisky, not too complex or intimidating but it’s got enough going on that you would always enjoy it. It’s around $65-$70 a bottle in my area and I think at the $50-$60(thats about what HP12 is around here) price point it would be about perfect."

3.5,"Bottled 2015.

Bunnahabhain = bunna = bunny.  This neo-classic 12 year old bunny is just hopping up and down, hitting you with salt and sugar.  You have to throw an award at it and call it a classic just to calm it down.

The amount of sherriness they were able to fit into this with just a peep of sulfur is amazing.  You get loads of red fruits and sherry nuttiness, bolstered beautifully by unabashed salt.  Bunnahabhain is carving out its niche as the fruity, salty nut dram, and that captain on the bottle has been kicking some Macallan 12 ass since the new bottling strength of 46.3% started.

This is a dram to pair with food.  By itself, it is damned by this snobbery word of graying cantankerous whisky reviewers shunning the bandwagoners: “engineered.”  I know they can’t just throw sugar and salt into the vat.  But it feels like they did.  This goes very well with savory foods; better than almost any red wine I’ve had. 

Score: * (unforgettably good)

4.0,"Almost a 4.5 it didn't quite live to my expectations. Safe to say that in a blind tasting i even wouldn't guess this is an islay dram, its peatiness is too dim. On the nose is very weak but gets a lot better on the palate and the finish is great.

Bottled at 46.3%abv, with a very attractive tawny natural color.

On the nose is very light. Brown cake (wedding cake) raisins, brownies and a earthy peat (not smoke, earth, dirt).

On the palate is a lot better, full smoke, tongue burn, hay, spices (pepper), oak.

Finish is spicy, mouth watering and very long. This is the best perk of the dram. Overall i give this whisky an 86 over 100. Cheers."

3.75,"A great and affordable bottle to just have around. The vanilla, fudge, fruity aroma has undertones of chocolate? The flavor is equally interesting, full and well balanced. Adding water suppress the bitter sense and brought out the sweet sense including hazelnut. It acted similarly on the flavor in regards to bring out sweetness, and also brought in more of the casks flavors."
4.0,"One of my favorites thus far. It's got that great mix between the nose, palate and finish. You'll find something new after every taste and after every whiff. An extraordinary feat for a dram with this price.

Nose: Chocolate, nuts and a whiff of smoke and peat. Also fresh baked bread, raisins and caramel. Like walking into a bakery.

Palate: Spices and sweets with wood notes and later fruits like grapes and oranges.

Finish: Here the peat makes its way into the experience together with candy-like influences, liquerish and leather."

4.5,"I like this a lot. 
The only islays I’ve had were Ardbeg 10 and Laphroiag 10, so I’m not well versed with peated whiskeys. I decided to grab a 50 ml bottle of Bunnahabhain 12 yr at Specs out of curiosity.

Nose was nice with sherry scents with some light citrus, grape, and apple. I detect some peat, but I had to dig for it as it blends with the wood notes.

The initial taste was similar to the nose but with spice and more wood. There’s a little brine in there too. 
The finish is where I detected some peat and was my favorite part. Nowhere close to the amount of peat like Laphroiag. The peat in this whiskey was just an accent that helps round off the flavor. 
I love this."

3.75,"The nose is dried flowers, potpourri, isopropyl alcohol, sherry and oak casks; Cherrywood. The aroma is a lot of finished wood and heavy alcohol fumes.

Tastes of heavy rock salt, with a dash of white pepper. The burn on the palate is no joke. Bittersweet sherry and Bing cherry. It's got a grainy component that reminds me of a thick Barleywine in beer parlance. 

The finish is is tiramisu, custard, vanilla creme, dried fruit peel, on a surprisingly delicate and creamy body. This one slaps you across the face and then politely apologizes."

Palate: Sweet and Salty, a bit dry, almost like liqorice root. You can Still taste the Sherry. 
Finish: Just fantastic. Spices start to flow, Pepper, you can definitely feel the heat. It soon gives way for some brine which then fades into sherry sweetness and lingers for a bit. You can feel the dryness on your tounge and top of the mouth. 

Thoughts: This whiskey takes you on a taste journey that's absolutely fantastic. For This Price it must be One of the best whiskeys in its class."

Un Islay intéressant!
Cette soirée se termine avec ce whisky peu fumé des Islay. Malheureusement, les deux whiskys précédents étaient si intenses et puissants qu'ils sont venus cacher les saveurs de ce scotch. Malgré tout, j'ai bien aimé le côté salin et iodé de ce produit. Je vais le réessayer quand je vais aller faire un tour chez mon frère."

3.5,"This has some notes with rougher edges than Bruichladdich Black Art does. It still has plenty of nice sweet richness though. There's plenty of smoke and sea spray with a little bit of that Laphroiag 10 band aid flavor. There's a good amount of toasted almonds and plenty of vanilla with a teensy bit of mintiness. It's very rich, but there is the kind of unpleasant bitter backing going on. It's a great sipper, but it could use a bit of work. Less of a bitter iodine backing would be especially nice - either that or at least some more developed flavors elsewhere. As it is, the flavors don't all fit together seamlessly and it's a bit lacking in complexity. The fudge and dark cherries that come through with a good sip of this push it up a level, making it a nice drink to enjoy. It isn't complex enough to move up another level though and it doesn't have a nice enough finish either."

4.5,"A great whisky, both in terms of its quality and price. 2 ppm phenols. Vatting of 75/25 bourbon/sherry casks. As the distillery’s standard bearer this is also nearly in a league of its own, and is one of the great basic scotches available, in the group with Springbank, Highland Park, & Lagavulin. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FiZD6nFo5KQ   ;   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c0nqz_4Q_XM

Aroma of sherry barrel, toasted nuts, and vanilla (brine and/or very light peat?). Palate includes sweet caramel and a bit of brine and ginger. Finish is medium length with light spice.
Overall this is a lightly salted caramel and slight funk (brine/peat)."

It still has quite the kick on the pallet that might turn away beginners."

Lovely dram!"

1.0,"GLASS:
Dalmore Glencairn Copita Nosing Glass

NOSE:
Neat - Golden raisins, honey, vanilla, cereal, with hints of herbs. A bit soapy.
With 4 drops of water and 2 minutes of rest - Darker raisins, Sugar Corn Pops Cereal, Wheatfields on a warm summer day. All of the herbal and soapy notes disappear.  

PALATE:
Neat - Ripe golden fruit, stony minerality, white pepper and ginger spice.
With 4 drops of water and 2 minutes of rest - Off-putting, oily, chemical notes overwhelm the fruit. Too much alcohol. Hot on the palate. 

CONCLUSION:
I have enjoyed this bottling in the past but not tonight. Unbalanced, shrill and hot with an unpleasant bite from the high alcohol content 46.3%. I look forward to revisiting in the future as it seems like tonight the bottle wasn’t showing it’s best. It might have been due to my asshole children being in the room. Whiskey is necessary when dealing with small children but it’s never an ideal pairing.  

----------------------------


RE-TASTED 2 WEEKS LATER:

NOSE:
Neat - New notes of toasted almond are now added to the golden raisins, honey, vanilla and cereal. Unfortunately, the soapy notes are now dancing with Clorox bleach. I’m not sure I want to put this in my mouth. 

PALATE:
Neat - I should have listened to my nose. No character. Shrill, hot and cloying. 

CONCLUSION:
I'm thinking of giving the rest of this bottle to a lawyer or child molester as payback for being a pox on humanity. On the bright side, I don't have to buy more weed killer.

The first time I had this I enjoyed it. These last two times it's been a big disappointment.

3rd TIME RETASTING:

GLASS:
Glencairn Whiskey Glass

NOSE:
Neat - Retasting for a third time after a couple of rough encounters with it. After resting for 20 minutes, I’m enjoying the vanilla, toffee, and toasted nuts aroma. Also brings a granola note. 

PALATE:
Neat - Jarring Ginger, pepper notes transition into a bitter finish. Still not a fan of this. 

CONCLUSION:

Three strikes. Not as bad as the last time I tried it but I’m realizing I long for the briny smoke of the other Islay Scotches. Caol Ila is my benchmark Scotch.   
$69.99 USD per Bottle"
3.5,"This dram is like an old friend you haven't seen in a while and forget just how much you miss them. The big Sherry with a dash of brine is just lovely on the palate. Whilst this is peated, I really don't get any smoke but do get the lovely brine and sea breeze notes. Out in my market this routinely goes for $60+ and with cost factored it's hard to call it a great value, but it's certainly a tasty alternative for those who are fans of Sherried Highland Malts!"
