5.0,"Everyone knows by now that Glendronach is my favorite distillery. They just make the best whisky there is, period. But even for them this is a new achievement: this is a relatively young one, and it manages to be amazingly perfect. It belongs from a 2003 vintage, 13yo, Single Sherry Cask #4034. 

Bottled at 52.5%abv FOR EXTRA FLAVOR, chesnut color.

On the nose, Perfection. Inmidiately you get this chocolate bathed oranges; Cocoa milk powder, Maraschino cherry syrup.

There is an alcohol note, strong but it doesn't bother you. The best description is a citric chocolate note overall. Hazelnuts. A Winey - grape note, Cinnamom spice not sweet but spicy. Acetone.

After 5 mins resting: hazelnuts, cough syrup and chocolate fudge. After a first sip, red fruits appear. So marvelous you just want to keep nosing it and never stop.

On the palate, Sweet cherries!! super sweet cherries and red fruits. That feeling after eating raisins, that is a flavor that persists.
Peach syrup. Almonds in chocolate like a ritter almond chocolate bar. 

Aftertaste is also a work of art. Chocolate and pepper. Ginger. Very dry. Cocoa milk powder in the walls of the mouth are also present.

Overall this whisky made me think about something: i should just stop buying samples and bottles that are not the single casks expressions of Glendronach. They are just out of this world. Grab them, any one of them and be happy. 100/100, Sláinte Mhath."
