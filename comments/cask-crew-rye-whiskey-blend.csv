4.25,Smooth drinkable bourbon and especially for the price
2.0,"Weak finish, not much spice. Definitely better in an old fashioned than straight. It’s so sweet that in the old fashioned I recommend a dash more bitters."
2.5,"Pretty much summed up by, ""meh."" kind of sweet and actually pretty smooth. Kind of surprised by all the people saying it's bitter and hot. Mine in muted and boring... Oh well. Worth a try."
3.5,"Sweet cherry/vanilla taste.  Initial charcoal-y bitter hit, little bit of burn, but sweet thereafter.  Surprisingly good after you let ice water it down a tiny bit.  Right away it’s a little harsh."

5.0,I'm not a die hard whiskey drinker but like to try new things. I've tried all three of these whiskeys and was very impressed at the flavor profile and smoothness of all of them. I've recommended this to a few whiskey drinking friends and they all have a thumbs up as well. Winner!
5.0,"This whiskey is unique in both its blend with high rye content and with its two flavors.  The flavored versions are different than everything else on the shelf and very on trend.  This whiskey is easy to drink, very smooth and an excellent value."
null,"I found Cask & Crew to be the opposite of your review- Palate was anything but bitter, in fact rather smooth and approachable for a rye/whiskey blend. The blend itself (almost half each) was intriguing as well and added an unexpected warmth at the finish. The flavors are very addictive for the newbie whiskey drinker, mainly because the flavors sit in the back, allowing the whiskey to play a leading role."

2.5,"+ .5 for 2.5 stars
       Nose: understated corn and hints of smoke, the nose may be the least exceptional thing about this blend.
      
      Taste: Not sweet or bitter,  starts warm and tappers off smoothly.  Theres nothing to get overly excited about here yet there is nothing to offend the pallate either. The rye/corn ratio works to make it a mildly interesting flavor but offers no real cumultive boldness.  I could certianly imagine the ginger and toffee  would be a great addition and work well inside this base blend.  As Mary noted it's really quite a smooth product and entirely approachable for the average drinker.   Certianly recommended to try along w/ the flavor variants.

These Cask & Crew (not including the standard) are FLAVORED whiskeys and should be considered as such."

1.0,Very lacking in flavor and no lasting taste in palette to speak of

2.0,"Tasting neat, all I can think when tasting or smelling this is Oatmeal.  It's very much unspicy for a rye, with more of a sicky kind of sweet taste."

1.75,Bland. Very little finish.

3.25,"It has a good color and nose is fine.  Goes down smooth, which is nice, but it doesn’t have a long finish.  Taste lacks something - Not terrible, but just OK.  Probably better as a mixed drink than straight."
