2.25,"Nose: Peaches and apricots, nectarines and pears, apples and lemons. A nose that is similar to many other fruity NAS Speysiders at this price point. There is a faint zephyr of honeysuckle as it rests and opens in the glass, but it's a shy and low-key experience. Adding water lowers definition but makes the nose broader and sweeter. It also brings out a soapy note and so is best avoided.

Palate: Cereal, grassy and fruity with a very small spice note. The arrival gives way quickly to a development that is all about lightly malted cereal. Biscuits and a little thin oatmeal porridge with a spoon of honey. The texture is a bit watery. Adding water does nothing good for the palate at all - it brings out a cardboard note and renders the whole affair very flat.

Finish: Short. Cereal and a trace of bitterness in the aftertaste. The finish is the only place where there is any improvement with water, due to a little sweetness that balances the bitter aftertaste.

The nose has a resemblance to both the Glen Grant 10 year old and The Major's Reserve (and also to Glenfiddich 12 in some ways), but it has less presence and is less cereal/malt in character. It has a more fruity focus and lacks the nutty richness that is usually found in Glen Grant whiskies. It's not a bad nose but it is very reticent - sort of one dimensional and overly easy - but there is certainly nothing objectionable about it.

The palate is basic and frankly too understated. It's not what I'd call subtle, just faint and seemingly over-diluted, but there are no specific faults worth noting. It is what it is - a simple, basic NAS malt that is just barely up to neat tasting and is best used as a mixer with soda or soft drink.

This expression has just released in Australia, where it is having its world launch, so you won't be seeing any reviews elsewhere for a few days at least.

Although this is priced between The Majors Reserve and the 10 year old in my opinion it is the least interesting Glen Grant release. I'm rating it a half-point below the Major's Reserve which puts it on the same shelf as the cheaper range of Glen Moray cask-finished malts, and blends such as Dewar's White Label. However this tasting was from a neck-pour, which I generally avoid doing, so if the character changes markedly over the coming week I'll report back with an update.

7 days later:
I'm into the heels of this bottle now but it has changed very little, if at all. I've mostly been drinking it with soda and in that context it seems to have become slightly sweeter but it could also just be me getting used to the profile. The neat taste now is essentially identical to the neat neck-pour. The rating stays the same.

""Acceptable"" : 2.25 stars"
