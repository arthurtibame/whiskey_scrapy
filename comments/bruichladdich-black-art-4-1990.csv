5.0,"Do I enjoy every note I get out of this? Not exactly, but do I respect every note, hell yes.  Wow man, I thought the Ardbeg Kelpie was a complex dram, but this one is a complete mindfuck, but not all in a negative way. Usually, I stick to peat and smoke, but this is none of that. On this nose, I get spices, lavender, sherry goodness, and citrus. On the palate, there are mushrooms in there, I kid you not. There is tropical subtle pineapple mixed with chocolate and Chinese five spice. This is insane. Malty aftertaste on the finish with a hint of chocolate fudge. It's like reading War and Peace. It's exhausting, but a great exercise. There is literally so much going on that I think it would take an entire bottle to sincerely reach everything there. Thanks to a Dram Dude (you know who you are) for the sample."

5.0,"$37.50 CAN (roughly $30 USD) for 1 oz. at The Caledonian in Toronto ~2016.  This was a steal, and last I checked they are now out, as are all bottles in my area.  The inertia for me to buy a bottle was that the nearest store that I knew of that had this in stock was 45 minutes away.  If it was closer, the $430 price tag would be no obstacle.  I had a second ounce, and even bought a pour for a good friend, who was relatively new to whisky.  He summarized the experience better than I could: “Wow.  Fruity.  Smooth.  Salty.  Wow.  I didn’t know whisky could be so smooth.”  I encouraged him to let the full finish fade before taking the next sip.  After 10 minutes, he got tired of waiting and went outside for a smoke.

NOSE: Bruichladdich’s whole tagline is that they believe in “terroir”, believe in the people, believe in Islay.  Blah blah blah.  Jim McEwen believes in France with this bottle.  “La Marseillaise” plays in my head immediately when I smell the glass.  You get hit with bordeux, cognac, and vermouth.  Intense exotic fruitiness comes after, and now the music changes to merengue.  Papaya, guava jam, mangoes.  Just when you think you’ve gone as far away from Islay as metaphysically possible, the brine brings you back.  What all those fancy sweet French cognacs are missing, apparently, is a wee bit of salt.

PALATE: Orgasmic.  The eyes roll into the back of the head.  The toes do curl.  You can’t even describe the arrival or the first sip, and you have to taste again.  The fruitiness is incredible and powerfully delivered by a thick, viscous, briny liquid.  Strawberry jam, raisins, sultanas.  This transitions into figs and dates.  Then you get some nuttiness with almonds and cashews.  Then it becomes sweet again.  What a rollercoaster!

FINISH: Like a good aged whisky, swallowing is the beginning of the experience.  The nose is re-experienced in the aftersmell as vapors rise from the depths of the gullet back into the nose.  It’s cognac and sherry, with a decent warmth of alcohol.  I dare not add water to temper this beast.  Ever so slowly, there is a transition to more familiar territory; after several minutes, the taste dries and saltiness dominates.  Perhaps there is a hint, or just a memory, of ash; maybe from peaty gamma radiation from whatever nuclear malting processes Bruichladdich uses to produce Octomore.

VERDICT: This is not for a single malt purist, and is the perfect discourse for those just looking for something that tastes amazing, and those looking for something that exemplifies single malt whisky.  This is as French as it is Scottish.  I don’t mind at all.  Jim McEwen has created the end-all be-all of wine-finished whiskies.  If you see a bottle, and you don’t hate wine finishes, buy it.  I hope the 5.1 is as good.  MARK: 96/100."

5.0,"Lord Almight! What a dram, what a dram what a dram. It's perfect, people. Just perfect! The color stands out the moment you pour this thing, and it's a reminder that this whisky has aged 23 years old. The nose is possessed by wonderful notes of almonds, butterscotch and pineapples. Remarkably fruity for something that is not sherried, the palate is complex with a body that is full and syrupy. The finish: long and satisfying. Bravo Bruichladdich!"
5.0,"Wow! Almonds and caramel on the nose, followed by a host of tropical fruit and malted cereal on the palate. The finish is long, smooth, and magically delicious. For me, this stuff is pure wizardry and deserves at least 6 stars. This is arguably one of the best whiskys I've ever had."
4.0,"Sweet on the nose with peach, orange blossoms, and a bit of oat if you look deep. Warm and welcoming sensation.
      
      Added 1 drop of Norwegian springwater. Taste is complex but balanced, I mostly pick up grain and a bit of anise, eventually lemon and a deep dark vine, possibly sherry. Starts out smooth, but the heat and pepper eventually builds up. 
  Aftertaste is a warm dry peat with tannins, that lingers for a while. 
  Inconclusive, dark and mysterious. 4 Stars for the craftmanship, though 3 for my personal tastes, bit too much grapeskin."

4.0,"Ooooohhh!! Spellbound - by both the taste and the price! But worth every penny. Floral/wine notes were a tad strong, the smoky sweetness agreed with me."
5.0,"One of my favourite whiskeys. The Black Art 4 1990 rewards patience with an incredible depth of flavour. The influence of the European oak in both the Sauternes and Bordeaux wine casks add a range of fruit notes: tropical fruits initially on the palate make way for more dried fruits notes, dark chocolate, citrus and oak. A complex whiskey, this one is worth letting sit on your tongue just that bit longer. Pairs particularly well with the tangy Cashel Blue cheese."
5.0,"Nose - Dark dried stone fruits, dark amber honey, hint of saline, toasted brioche, milk chocolate.
Taste - Dried cherries, strawberries, cranberries, freshly oiled/tanned leather, hint of sea salt milk chocolate, faint medicinal/fruity honey, lighly drying mouthfeel.
Finish - Long gentle sweet fruit leather, gentle warmth, hint of sweet tobacco, wisp of campfire smoke mixed with sea air, cognac/port like sweetness.
Score - 94/100
Final Thoughts - I absolutely love the nose on this one in that it has a nice fruity salty chocolaty nose that is well balanced and not overpowering. Once it hits your tongue it delivers on pretty much everything the nose promised in a very well balanced package. The faint fruity/medicinal note is unexpected as it reminds me of goji berries, but not as metallic. The transition to the finish leaves this very pleasant warmth in your mouth like taking a sip of hot cocoa after coming in from the cold on a winter day. Although it's stated as unpeated, I get a very very faint wisp of campfire smoke like if you smelled a campfire on the beach from afar. Not overpowering, but a nice addition. This really reminds me of Bunnahabhain 18 which is another favorite. If not for the price, I'd love to have this on the regular."

5.0,"I tasted this Black Art as the finale in the non-peated line on a Bruichladdich masterclass. Needless to say, it was the summon of what we tasted that day. The dark, pronounced color was a real feast on the eyes - anticipation and expectations were set high, to say the least. 
The Black Art completely filled in everything expected, and more! Rich and floral on both the nose as the palate and it is definitely the most exotic and 'colourful' whisky I've tasted this far. It shouldn't come as a surprise that I voted this one as my favourite non-peated whisky of the whole tasting. It's just perfect."
4.0,"Pure hedonism! Dried fruits, almond syrup, very dark malt, dark roasted coffee, though the proof shows through a bit on the nose. Chewy figs, petrol, sweet rolls, bittersweet chocolate. Really giving whisky, and evolves in the glass too. Little over sherried but only a little. It’s daunting  at first but enticing after a sip. Can’t say that about many whiskies."

4.5,"Wow I thought the Dalmore Cigar wasn't to bad and a 4 star. This shoots straight to 5 on the first sip. I have paid a lot more for a lot less.  It reminds me of a great Glendronach in a lot of ways although sweeter and with different components to the usual straight olorosso or px flavour. Bam raisins and dark fruit nose and palate. There is a hell of a lot more going on a mere mortal like me can't comprehend, sauternes influence is all over it, rich cognac like flavours. Personally I thought Bruchladdich was over rated. Most of their stuff is weak flavored. Even their Octomore range I find over priced and thin (but still 4 star rating before everyone starts sharpening their pitchforks :-) ), missing the richness of other Islays. This however has viscosity and richness to burn. Alcohol at 49.2% is perfectly balanced. It would almost be an instant 5 but I'm finding it a bit to sweet and syrupy the longer I get into it so more around the 4.5 mark, maybe slightly lower. Still very very nice and not a 4 so must be a 5. One of those weird situations where I rate something a must buy but I wouldn't due to the syrupy sweetness."

5.0,"The flavor of the Black Art is definitely a unique one. It has a quite interesting dry fruit taste that I didn’t found on any other whiskey I’ve tried. The finish was a bit too dry to my taste, and the alcohol kick on the palate is just a tiny bit too harsh. A drop of water will solve the problem. Overall, a fantastic whiskey! I’m not quite sure how much I have left in my bottle, because I can’t really see through :p"

Nose: rich sweetness. Dark honey and maple syrup; chocolate; butter cream; slight oakiness; dark fruit in the background, like plum, raisin and raspberry; hint of spice, maybe cinnamon? Very layered and complex and evolves in the glass with time.

Taste: incredibly rich and oily! Sweetness abounds with raw honey, milk chocolate, light caramel. Development comes in waves of coffee bean, juicy dark red fruit, slight herbal, orange/tropical, and well-rounded oak. It’s a ride.

Finish: a long one, with chocolate-covered dark cherry, hazelnut, caramel/toffee and a slight saltiness and hint of mint.

Value: avg around $400 USD. Worth it!

Final thoughts: what a whisky! This is a unicorn bottle for sure, and one that is luckily still fairly available at the time of this review (Sept 2019). The complexity of this dram makes every sip an odyssey of flavors. Don’t miss this one, even at the high price point...it’s likely your favorite unpeated single malt.

Final score: 5/5  Buy right now!

4.5,"Nose - huge fruity notes, a touch of islay salt/brine, spices (perhaps cinnamon among some others).  There's a bit of fudge and a very subtle bit of nut in the background.  

Taste - Fudge, touch of salt, fruity sherry notes, and oak tannin.  It's a bit bitter which keeps it interesting but I'm a bit more of a sweets sucker so I'm not loving that aspect.  

Another long lasting, super complex wine cask influenced whisky bringing everything that scotch dreams of.  

I think I'm going 4.5 here but I should add that HP25 is a stronger 4.5.  I actually think the two are really similar and comparable options."

4.5,Amazing complexity - fruity and sweet from heavy use of Sherry casks but simultaneously there’s a typical Islay saltiness. But it’s more complex than that with an interesting muskiness on the finish.  96

4.5,"Color: Dark copper. I was stunned to see how dark this was in the glass.
Nose: Malt forward. Maybe some plum. Anise. Overall “airy” feel. Some other kind of fruit, probably some kind of grape.
Taste: Comes alive in a big way. It’s difficult to explain just how big this comes in without swearing. There is an amazingly fruity burst, malty undertone, spicy wood, and a funk. The funk doesn’t necessarily taste of cheese, but it is the kind of funk a sharp cheese has.
Finish: Malty, warm but not spicy. It tasted old in that way whisky and tobacco can taste that sounds bad but really is a good thing."

The short version is that this stuff really is that good.

F: Rich rumble of thunder from the sherry influence. Deep red wine tannin, raspberry tartness, chutney."
