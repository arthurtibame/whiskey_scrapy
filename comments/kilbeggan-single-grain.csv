3.0,For a small investment it’s a great poor. Lots of floral and fruit on the tongue with a hint of peat and smoke on the finish.

3.0,"Nice! Perfect sipper for a hot summer day. Sweet, vanilla. Light spice. All around solid with nothing fancy"
3.0,"Not bad, a little harsh for my taste, esp at fist, but it grew on me. Probably wouldn't buy. (Garavans in Galway)"

3.75,"Good taste but very sweet, mostly corn"
2.0,Caramel on the nose before tasting. Spicy rich flavor and a long smooth finish. Finish is smoother than the sip

3.0,"Its light, thin, and palatable.  Simple honey sweetness and coconut flavors.  Not much of a finish.  Easy drinking and certainly something you can mix with.  Great bottle design as well."
3.0,Caramel

3.0,Good Irish Whiskey. Like the Irish the taste is different than the Scottish ones. If you wish to try an Irish this is not the one to take. Try the Red Breast.
4.25,Easy drinking. Good flavors. Tastes like bourbon

3.5,"Nose: Pears and apples blending with caramel. Some malt. Cut grass. Subtle honey and coconut.

Palate: Buttered biscuit. Honey. Toasted almond. Some spice towards the end. 

Finish: Hints of oak and malt. Vanilla coming through. Slightly spicier here.

Overall Thoughts: A decent whiskey! Certainly not a typical flavor but definitely interesting and complex. Relatively lower price but of a higher quality than it’s price tag. I’ll happily try the other Kilbeggan whiskeys in due time, they seem to know exactly what they’re doing!"
4.0,"Sweetly vanilla-like. Rich a brightly full flavoured, lacking peat. I like"

4.25,Spicy notes shine through. A unique Irish whiskey!
3.25,Pretty solid Irish whiskey
4.0,Got a bite then smooths out with a touch of vanilla.
4.0,Very vanilla-y nose. A gentle bite of peat.  Some hints of fruit and citrus. Crisp and clean finish.
3.25,"Nose of apple and pear. The second sniff is just a touch of spilled black ink and the last, fleeting drippings of a gas pump.

The flavor is more tree fruits: pear, red apple skins, apricot. The potpourri, flowery spice comes dances on the palate. There is a surprising burn for 86 proof. 

The finish is tobacco smoke and more of that inky stuff. The more you add water droplets, the more the burn subsides and the apple skins pop out. Tannic/puckery tartness that dovetails well with the citrus and spice. A pretty solid, affordable Irish."

2.0,"It’s cheap and it has a little more balls than Jameson (being 86 proof rather than 80). Other than that it’s a hardly on par if not below par Irish, even for the price. The flavors do not linger and almost seem artificial. Perhaps could be used as a nice drink to pair with your dessert because while the flavors don’t linger- the ones that come through are heavier on the creamy honey side but lacking in spice, barrel woods, smoke, and fruit. Bought it to try something new on the cheap end, but won’t be buying again. Just drop an extra $5 and you’re enjoying a much more authentic yet cheap Irish in the Tyrconnell."

4.5,"Oh so smooth! Sweet honey and vanilla on the nose and tongue. Warm afterglow. Simple, no complexity here. Let it warm up and sip neat or highball it. Great value pick"
