3.5,This bourbon is quite different than the 10 and 14 year siblings. First. It presents with a very spicy front taste with hints of vanilla. The finish is long with after taste of oak. I prefer the 10 year bourbon or the 14 year bourbon from the Widow Jane line up.

2.0,"Appearance: Copper, reddish. It has the look you'd expect of a bourbon that aged 12 years.

Nose: The oak was inescapable on this pour. Varnished wood shines through. There is a slight sweetness almost hidden in the nose, but that varnished wood, that dark charred oaky note mixed with pepper and spice are just inescapable. 

Taste: For my taste this whiskey is over oaked. I prefer aged whiskies that balance spice and oak with sweet vanilla, butterscotch, toffee and maple flavors. For me the Widow Jane 12 brings flavors of raw varnished oak to the table with no sweetness to balance. 

Finish: Medium. More oak...the oak never stops with this one.

Sampled this one in a flight neat in a glencairn. I imagine people who prefer over oaked, dry, tannic whiskies will love this one. 

It's not for me."
4.25,"Wow. So much Barrel influence for only 12 years. Very reminiscent of Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, but more complexity from the higher proof. Cordial Cherries, Charred Oak, and Vanilla on the Nose. Heavy Oak, Old Leather, slightly metallic on the palate."

3.5,"Two weeks in for stay in place, in NJ /NYC, the new epicenter of nCV19, the little virus that made the world stand still.  The little virus that bought global supply chains to its knees.  The little virus that sunk our portfolios 25-30%.    Two weeks in, working from home, with kids doing online schooling, and the wife and I sharing an office.  Two weeks in, and I’m still married; 2 weeks in and the kids haven’t killed each other.  2 weeks in, and the 80yr grandpa living with us is still safe.  There’s a few other things to be thankful of besides still being married, and the kids not having killed each other after 2 weeks of close quarter confinement.  We still have jobs.  We still are healthy and haven’t yet the virus.  We will come out of this.  One way or another, we’ll be fine. The human race has seen WW1, WW2, Black Death, Three  Crusades, and much more...so, we’ll be fine.  

So this week’s celebratory pour is a 12 yr bourbon made by MGP, bottled by Widow Jane, graciously given to me by my King Of American Spirits buddy @dubz480 .  I’ve had one Widow Jane before, an apple wood matured one, which was pretty good...but the VFM wasn’t there.  This is similar—-pretty good, but $100 for a 12 yr MGP is a bit high, especially considering you can get a Barrell bourbon for a bit less and at CS. 

This has classic cinnamon roll, sweet corn taste.  A bit light, which makes for a great regular sipper.  I still preferred their Applewood one, but this was a welcome pour after another rough week of shelter in place and working the front lines of corporate nCV19 response task force.  

Thanks @dubz480 for the pour!"

3.75,"I've been wanting to try this one for a while now but could never bring myself to spend $100 on Widow Jane. The 10yr can be bought for under $60 so is 2 yrs of age and a slight bump in ABV really worth the $40 premium? Let's explore what's in the bottle and then dive to the tasting!

So what we have here is a 12yr old MGP Sourced Single Barrel. It's brought down to 49.5% ABV using limestone water from the Widow Jane mines (same limestone used to build the Brooklyn Bridge). They don't disclose the Mashbill but based on the taste I am going with the lower Rye Mashbill MGP produces (21% Rye). I am reviewing a Total Wine Pick for the AZ market. Let's dive in...

It's enters rich and fairly oily with a big vanilla and burnt brown sugar note with a heavy dose of oak. Baking spices then creep in with cinnamon sugar leading to a decent oak and pepper filled finish. Classic MGP cinnamon roll profile! The sweeter profile you tend to get from MGP Bourbon with this amount of age, and it's definitely tasty

In conclusion is it worth the premium on the 10 year? Not entirely but that said $100 for a good 12 yr old MGP barrel is pretty close to market price these days. At cask strength this would be a 4.5/5... At 99 proof and cost factored it's just shy of 4. 

Cheers all!"

4.25,"Had neat.  This is powerful, rich in brown sugar, spice and almost a little heavy on the oak...to the point that this tasted like a much older bourbon.  The oak makes this a little hotter and heavy in alcohol profile than it actually is.  The minerality of Widow Jane is present and this is a robust and well executed product.  Enjoyed."

4.5,"Neat.  Opened for quite a few weeks now.  Wasn’t planing to leave a review but the nose really grabbed me on this.  Tons of honey and graham cracker up front.  Then get vanilla and pepper.  Salted caramel.  Hint of oak balancing it out.  Hint of mint on the nose as well.

Nice thickness on the texture.  Sugar and maple up front.  Hits you quick with the honey, vanilla and hint of pepper again.  Slight hint of rye.  

Delicious, dessert MGP.  Really good pick by Party Source."

4.25,"This one tastes like oak. The nose reminds me of splitting logs when I was a kid and that continues with the flavor. Lots of oak and vanilla with the typical bourbon sweetness here. Nice expression, I save for special occasions"
4.5,"Neat.  Party Source pick.  Apples, cream and vanilla off the top of the nose.  Nice, bright nose.  Hint of oak and spice. The type of nose that gets you really excited for a sip.  Definitely recognize the MGP of it.

Nice mouth feel.  Apples and brown sugar initially.  Apples and vanilla gives way to that oak and spice.  Hint of chocolate on the legs.

Nice job Widow Jane and Party Source.  I should have grabbed this long ago.  Really good MGP."
4.5,"NOT a thin bourbon— it’s dark, rich, earthy. Pour and you’ll not burn."
