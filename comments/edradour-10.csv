I tried adding a bit of water and it didn't help.  I guess this one is just not a match for me.  That said - I'd love to try another older scotch from this distillery to see if time helps it out."

I can easily see why someone would give a 4 star, there is somehting missing from it to me on giving it a distinguishing stand taste.  Well worth the try if you like ardbeg or laphroaig 10 year."

Not quite, but something like mineral water, and I can't stand that stuff. Unless there is a lot of peat, I've noticed that it's hard for me to get into any distillery's base 10 product. Finish was medium, but grainy and a dry wood taste."

3.0,"Based in Pitlochry and owned by independent bottler Signatory Vintage, Edradour remains one of the smallest distilleries in Scotland. Rich honey sweetness, heather and a diffuse flowery scent encounter the nose on first contact. Very nice, but obviously young. Something bothers me on the palate. It is neither the sweet maltiness, paired with oranges and spices, nor the soft and creamy character. There is something sharp and herbaceous that is hard to pin down. The finish is fairly short with honey and bitter nuts. Not a bad malt, but slightly disjointed.

The nose is quite pleasant and complex with notes of cherries, vanilla and sherry. The body is regretfully completely flat and weak, with a palate that reminds me of the speculos spread very popular in Europe (like a sugary cookie). The finish is likewise pleasant but short. Good stuff."

2.5,"Nose: Cider vinegar and malty spiced notes - an aroma remarkably like still active malt wort. Spicy oak aromas, sherry, some caramel and vanilla. An earthy and slightly dank note underpins everything. It's not unpleasant, but unusual, and keeps developing for a good while. A dash of water disperses the earth dankness and highlights the sherry.

Palate: A sweet and dense malty/fruity arrival that develops some gingery spice. The texture is on the thick and chewy side. Fruit and nut milk chocolate. Water highlights the heavy fruit character and tones down the spice, which thickens the texture even more.

inish: Fairly long, medium sweet sherry with spices on the end that tend to turn a little sour in the aftertaste.

A curious whisky. The nose has an interesting winey/earthy quality that makes you expect something bold and interesting of a similar character on the palate. However when you get to it the palate suddenly veers off course into grassy, vegetal flavours, before eventually recovering and getting back onto the original track for the finale. It was interesting and instructive to try, but I'm not going to buy a bottle.

Tasted from a 30ml sampler.

5.0,I’m finding it hard after hundreds of drams to find something remotely close to Edradour. I’ve had many older whiskies (some well over 25 years old) that cant really top my love for Edradour. They produce an unusual single malt. The nose is spectacular and it resonates with my personal tastes more than any dram. A complex malty butterscotch nuttiness that is unlike anything else. Literally a 100/100 especially for the age.
