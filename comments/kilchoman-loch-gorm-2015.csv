5.0,"Gentle peat smoke and sea salt immediately noticeable on nosing , joined by notes of currents or  raisins followed by lavender and nuts when a few drops of water were added.  The flavors were sweet   berries or plums, smoked salmon and salted butter.  The peat smoke is present but not intrusive.  Drinks older than it is."

4.0,There are not many whiskies out there that has this much peat on the nose but mellows nicely in the transition to the palate. Malty and brinny. Would give an extra 0.5 star if available

4.0,"My first Kilchoman and I must say I'm impressed. The closest Islay I can compare it to flavour profile wise is Lagavulin 16. I can't believe this is only 5 years old. Rich peatiness, gunpowder, ash, cacao. Bitterness detracts a bit from the experience but not to overpowering. I'd love to see this in 2026 and put it head to head with Laga16. It's a slight price premium to Laga 16 (well the 2017 edition can't find the 2015) here in NZ which in my mind isn't justified but hey still good value for money. Def solid 4 at least, maybe early 4's. Looking forward to trying the '17 edition"

It's a bit sweet but I like it."

  What else do you need?  This mighty five year old, yes, five year old tastes like a 12. Hell,  maybe even a 14.  Great dram right at a hundred smackers."

3.0,"Bright, saline, briny peat hits you on the nose. After the first wave subsides, you can pick up the sweetness, dark chocolate, red berries, sherry, vanilla, toffee. Salty iodine peat on the palate. Some sweetness there, but not as much as the nose suggests. Finish, salty peat, mid-length. Not my favorite ever Islay. I feel like it would fall in the Talisker camp of very briny smoke."
