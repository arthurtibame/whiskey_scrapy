5.0,"Fantastic bourbon! Keith's tasting notes on the original review are spot on. One can easily savor each of the notes mentioned. Incredibly smooth for 100 proof, can't imagine drinking this any other way than neat but will try it again with an ice cube and see what happens. Teriffic value too, this can easily be my everyday bourbon."

5.0,"Spiced, sweet, and smooth."
3.0,"A step up from any comparatively priced Beam bourbon--better than the White Label, the Black Label, Devil's Cut, the Double-Oaked (etc., etc.,)--and yet it stil just doesn't quite work for me. Enjoyable enough, but the quirks of the Beam flavour (oh, you peanut-y funk) mean that it doesn't actually play particularly well in any of the settings where you might otherwise want a bonded, 100 proof bourbon. In other words, the flavour is just too idiosyncratic: it spoils Manhattans and Old-Fashioneds alike with that leathery, Beam-y, earthy, peanut-y funk. Flavours throughout of caramel, honey, vanilla, and oak. Creamed corn sweetness, mint, cinnamon-spice and leather and nuts. And a decent body, though a short finish. Palatable on the rocks if you don't want to think about your drink (though you will always think, ""yup, Beam.""). But as an experience that comes together and offers something compelling, it just doesn't really work. If you're Beam loyal, my advice is this: go up a price-bracket for sipping whiskey (Knob Creek, Baker's, Booker's) or make a lateral move for a cocktail whiskey in Beam's unsung Straight Rye (which is much more lively, with spicy flavours and a sweetness that help balance the Beam funk--it's the real unsung hero of the family). And if you're desperate for a bottom-shelf ""shot-and-a-beer""-type combo? Well, respect your elders Old Grand-Dad and Old Overholt."

4.0,"oak, cherry cola, burnt butterscotch, big red gum, peanut butter oatmeal cookies, hints of corn & earth, oily short spicy finish, doesn't hide it's heat very well but never overbearing. Overall great stuff for the $16 price tag. If I tried this in a blind tasting I would assume a whiskey of higher caliber. Quality way past the price tag. I would definitely buy this again."
4.0,"My dad was Jim Beam guy; used to buy White Label by the handle. He'd fix himself a bourbon and water (or two, or three...) every evening, and on hot country Texas afternoons, he and my Mema would sit out on her porch and enjoy a cool-me-down iced bourbon and water. Since I couldn't partake, I usually got put on drink-runner duty, which by middle school really meant I was refreshing their glasses and sneaking a few sips of my own...so suffice it to say the Jim Beam flavor profile is one I've got in my bones, and for years I just assumed was what all bourbon tastes like - sweet caramel and vanilla, with some spice and that je ne sais quiois earthy funk. That said, the basic bottling is also thin, young, and a little uninspiring to the more developed palate...but Bonded solves those problems with extra aging and being bottled at a higher proof. This is what Beam can be - a sweet-earthy nose of vanilla, caramel, and forest floor in autumn, with a sparky, punchy palate that conjures up Red Hots candy, a milk chocolate-and-caramel covered vanilla cookie, yeasty bread, and a bit of petrichor and old leaves. At $20 a bottle, this is a great value find and a versatile workhorse bourbon that sips fine on its own, but has enough backbone to work well on ice or in a cocktail."

It literally does taste like a higher proof beam. Something about it feels more bearable than white label, but this should only be used for shots if you're tryna get crunk. To which, it succeeds."

2.0,"I purchased a fifth of Jim Beam Bonded for my trip last week simply to enjoy a few strong bourbon & Cokes after golf.  This bottle runs $25 and the 100 proof provides a slightly better ""bang for the buck"" over the regular JB.  I returned home with just enough to make one more cocktail and to sample a dram for this review.

The nose is still mostly sweet, candied corn and charred oak.  There's a little vanilla and butterscotch there, as well.  

The palate is pretty harsh and IMO this should only be used as a mixer.  It's peppery, oaky and pretty hot.  Those three flavors drown out almost everything else.  The finish is kinda short, astringent and harsh.  Not a single redeeming quality here.  Just dump it in your favorite mixer of choice and enjoy the extra 10% from the ABV to ""get the job done"" a little quicker.  Otherwise, I'd avoid it."

3.0,"Nose - Light vanilla & cinnamon, oaky burnt caramel, dry roasted in-shell peanuts that are a bit old so they're a bit oily.
Taste - Sweet cinnamon hinted caramel drizzled peanut brittle, light bitter oak, hint of salted peanut shell bitter.
Finish - Lingering cinnamon red hot spice kick sweet, lightly bitter peanut sweetness, charred cinnamon stick bitter spice.
Score - 69/100
Final Thoughts - So this is definitely a step up from the white label. The off putting wet cardboard notes I previously got are gone, but they seem to be replaced by this salty bitter oak that although not completely off putting, are a bit distracting. Traditional vanilla/caramel notes seem to be a bit dominated by the Beam peanut funk that I don't get as much from their other offerings like Booker's. Still affordable, I'd probably reserve this one as a mixer as opposed to a daily sipper."

4.0,"Familiar Beam smell... honey, hotness, walnuts, and that something extra. Nose opens up over time, surprisingly complex. You could take a while describing the nose. On the palate, this is both flavorful and smooth. Chocolate, nuts, caramel, spice, butterscotch, wood. This isn't as intense, and the finish isn't as long, as Booker's, but it's Booker's Jr. (as you can tell, I'm a fan of Booker's). Adding a limestone water ice cube seems to somehow increase the warmth on the backend? That can't be right. It does accentuate some spice and bring out some caramel at the end. But anyway, this may be the best easy-to-find $20 bourbon out there. 2/14/17

3.5,"Jim Beam Bonded is basically an amped up regular JB, but offers better value and kick at 50% ABV.  Some describe this one as a younger Knob Creek and it does hint at KC flavors but not nearly as deep, rich, and savory.  

Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn.  Nose is not overly exciting but offers the basics: caramel, vanilla, dusty corn grain, cinnamon spice and oak.  

On the palate you get immediate spice on the tongue and some heat but not overwhelming.  Lightly sweet corn ethanol with nutty peanut brittle or peanut butter undertones.  Definitely the expected Beam dusty peanut flavors here, and once the palate fully adjusts I quite enjoy the flavor even though it's fairly one dimensional.  

Finish is medium with some oak, vanilla, hints of maple, light tobacco.  Finish is not deep and rich maple or strong oak like Knob Creek but I taste similar flavors, just much weaker.  The finish is the best part of this expression as some richer notes pop up that don't present in the nose or immediate palate.

Overall it's certainly not bad, but not terribly exciting in any way.  It's really just a less watered down regular JB for a decent price, which is not a bad thing if you like Beam products.  For a BiB bourbon, I'd take Henry McKenna all day, but it's also $15 more per bottle.  A closer comparison would be Evan Williams BiB, but I prefer the JB.  But to be honest Wild Turkey 101 or Beam Distiller's Cut beats this or the EW by a mile in flavors for similar cost!  Cheers!"

To the palate it is very bold and spicy, with a powerful alcoholic kick.  Sticky brown sugar, black pepper corns, vanilla bean and fresh ginger with a hint of herbal mint.
-
The finish has some smoky charcoal, tobacco, dark chocolate, sweet corn and lingering warm oak with pepper.

Adding some water chases out some cherry candy aromas, and cola flavours on the palate, as well as shifting the pepper note to coarse ground black pepper.  The finish becomes more dry, however, but with time in the glass, the rich sweetness returns.

3.75,"1st at $20/750ml this is good value and surprising good, at a 4. The reason I tried it because someone on this app said it is better than Jim Beam Single Barrel. Agree. Add a cube of ice if you want to soften the burn. It’s a balance of sweet and spicy, mint balanced with smoky oak.  I bought it to give my father-in-law instead of Wild Turkey Rare Breed, it’s that good and 1/2 the price."
3.0,"Nose: Vanilla, oak, peanut, light cinnamon, alcohol and a touch of char. With a little time in the glencairn it picks up a citrus note.

Neat: Sweet! Vanilla, caramel, underdone sugar cookies, overwhelming Peanut Butter, and cocoa. A little heat, but not excessive for 100 proof. Eventually, much like the nose, the citrus decides to make an appearance and the vanilla increases, but not enough to compensate for the Beam peanut funk. Coats on the finish with peanut and light oak. 

Splash: A few drop of water adds a healthy dose of cinnamon to both nose and palate.

Verdict: At first, I was not a fan of this one. I prefer my Beam with a little extra age (Knob Creek, Distillers Choice) or extra barrel (Double Oak). I find the overwhelming peanut funk too much in younger expressions. Age and oak seem to get rid of it. What redeemed the Bonded in my eyes was its performance on the rocks. The melt and temperature change from one large cube seemed to tame the offending note and actually made it quite good. If you want to move up in the Beam lineup, I think the Double Oak, Distiller's Choice, Black Label, or even the Devil's Cut are better options."

Palate: The charred oak leads with the vanilla sugars right behind, it's a great reminder of what bourbon is all about,  spicy ginger heat and yes, even tobacco roll through.
 
Finish:  The back end finds all those flavors and trails off quick with the bonded strength finish.  This one ends much rougher than it begins and leaves no doubt what you are putting away. 

This is a great ""antique"" level bourbon easily found on the shelf at a bargain price making it the pretty good deal you expect from an American traditional name like Beam.

2.75,"Picked this up looking for something new from Beam, hoping for something as good as the Black label but with a little more kick. Unfortunately this is nothing like Beam Black. An aside, I have no idea how this gets a 90 here. 

This whiskey is a standard BiB offering from Beam. It pours a medium gold in the glass and leaves a few skinny legs with some water droplets. The nose was a little surprising: it’s fairly hot with musty corn, light cinnamon spice, and very little sweetness. So far it’s more reminiscent of the White label than the Black and that’s not good. 

The palate echoes the nose with oak, some heat, and some dry spice. The typical bourbon notes of caramel and vanilla are pretty much non-existent. The finish hangs on a while with more dry, musty, oaky spice. 

This bottle was pretty disappointing even considering the source and the price. I paid $23 for this locally, but it comes off more like a $15-20 bottle. There doesn’t seem to be much difference between this and the white label other than the proof. Not recommended for sipping neat but it’s fine for mixing. Its dry profile actually makes a decent Old Fashioned, so not a complete loss. 2.75/5."

5.0,Decent bourbon for the price. Easy to sip with not much burn to me.  I taste vanilla and peanuts which is something new for me. Tasted better neat than on the rocks.
3.25,Beam grown up. Good all around bourbon. Smooth with very little bite for a 100 proofer. Vanilla with a solid oak finish.

3.75,"This was my first bonded bourbon and I'm not disappointed for the $20 price point. The nose leads off with strong vanilla followed closely by cherry and burnt sugar (the type you find on top of creme brulee). The first sip was everything I was expecting, vanilla forward with caramel making an appearance mid way through and oak spice to cap off the finish with subtle hints of vanilla and cherry. Surprisingly smooth for a 100 proof and the finish was rather quick. I did get hints of cinnamon on the finish as well. I would gladly stock this as a daily sipper for days I'm looking for a lot of vanilla sweetness. This bourbon was enjoyed neat as all bourbon should."

3.5,"750ml neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose is quite assertive, with honey, vanilla, spice, green apple, leather, heat.  Taste is initially dusty, with vanilla, oak, rye spice and heat building.  Fairly short and dry finish.  Decent enough, would be a great mixer probably.  8/7/19"

4.0,"BACKGROUND: Released in 2015, Jim Beam Bonded is a re-issue of the bottled-in-bond product that was originally available decades ago when the company’s namesake was still living.

In order to be marketed as “bottled-in-bond,” a bourbon must meet stringent guidelines outlined in federal law.  The guidelines stipulate it must be the product of one distilling season from one distillery, it must be aged in a federally bonded warehouse for at least four years, and it must be bottled at 100 proof.

It is said that David M. Beam, Jim Beam’s father, did not want to give the federal government unchecked access to his warehouses when the original BiB bourbon was being aged, so he put his own lock on the door next to the government’s.  He claimed it was his way of “keeping everybody honest.”

As a result, Jim Beam Bonded prominently includes a graphic of two keys on its label - one for David Beam and one for the government.

I enjoy many of Jim Beam’s more limited offerings - such as the Repeal Batch, Double Oak, and Distiller’s Cut - and have yet to find a BiB bourbon I did not like, so I was eager to give Bonded a taste.

NOSE: Bonded smells exactly like the sweet cordial liquid inside a chocolate covered cherry…and I mean EXACTLY.  There’s some oak, as well, but not prominent.  There is no trademark Beam peanutty funk (and I mean funk in a good sense, not a bad one).  Just loads of sweetness and some oak.

PALATE: There is loads of sweet fruit, vanilla, and a bit of spice, but, again, no nuttiness that usually denotes a Beam product.  The bourbon is surprising thick, syrupy, and viscous in texture.

FINISH: The finish contains no burn and no bite, but it also does not linger.  The sweetness quickly dissipates.  The delightful oily texture, through, remains in the jaw.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: Jim Beam is one of those brands that some people like to unjustly belittle because doing so makes them somehow feel superior, Bonded is yet another Beam product that deserves praise, not derision.  

At less than $20 a bottle, it is quite a bargain.  Unfortunately, it is also impossible to find in my area, so I had to purchase this bottle in another state.  The next time I run across it on a shelf, I will purchase several bottles as it will make an excellent daily sipper."

3.5,"Notably light color
Spice nose, hint of eaucalyptus.  Golden raisins and honey, flaked cereal grains and vanilla.
Toast, spice. Mildly astringent, warm palate and finish carries notes that match the nose but also carries undertones of light oak.
Excellent value"

4.0,"Jim Beam. This was my High School Bourbon. Not a lot of choice or styles in PA but visiting FL. Lots of variations. 
The you tube “It’s Bourbon Night”  had a Jim Beam Bonded. 
Had to Try.... 
Aroma has a slight vanilla forward note It’s a 100 proof so there is a very alcohol forward smell. Not bad but you know it’s potent. 
Flavor Starts slightly harsh middle vanilla and caramel and ends with a slight nuttiness almost pecan.  The Bonded Beam Ends With a slight alcohol harshness leaves a nutty pecan aftertaste. I like pecans so that’s a good thing. 
Not bad. I’m glad to see my ole high school favorite is still good."

3.75,"Feel the burn baby. Oaky and sweet on the nose, warm and inviting. The taste is trip. Those cinnamon ball candies with an emphasis on the cinnamon and oddly enough some sweet tobacco, reminds me of my days dipping long cut. This one goes very well with a cap or 2 or water mixed in. Tones down the burn and transforms to a wonderful sweet whiskey, cinnamon, sweet corn, and switched the emphasis on the cinnamon candies to the candy! And at the price I would not walk past this"

4.0,"Nose... Maple candied walnuts, cinnamon, cherry, apricots and a hint of vanilla.

Appearance... A nice light mahogany.

Taste... Rich and buttery it's corn dominant. Fruits like plum and orange come forward, followed by a nice pepper seasoning.

Overall... I'm happy they ran the sale on this bottle, because I normally shy away from Beam. I have felt consistently that certain Bourbons or Whisky's would find themselves that much more enjoyable had they been bottled at the right age and proofed at the worthy alcohol percentage. Sometimes though, Beam and others seem to run on a tight margin and apparently the masses love brown water as opposed to brown liquor which keeps their profits in the black. This Beam though scoffs at that premise, as it's good to go..."

3.0,"I very thoroughly enjoyed it at the price point (50% clearance for $16.99) but I wouldnt pay full msrp.

It's got grown-up and more distinguished peanut funk. The palate steers towards the delicious rye hints of OGD, age perhaps? Mouth is even more (by truly only a pinch) oily than regular Jimmy B, but it's well placed unlike regular beam. The kind of mouth you get from standard knob--nice enough.

The 100 proof got me in trouble. I could see this being a very nice gift for someone who swears by Beam as it's so much more than the regular expression. Bump it up to 3.5 for ease of drinking--this one is easyyyyy going down."

3.75,"Shockingly good for the price. Touch of sweetness / caramel with some nuttiness to add complexity and enough proof to stay balanced. Punches far above its weight class, and a steal as a daily drinker.

I haven’t yet blinded this with Jim Beam Single Barrell, but I suspect it’d win out."
3.75,Nice bonded offering at a good price point. A little smoother than Evan Williams bonded and a little more expensive but still a deal.
2.0,"I haven't been a fan of this since the day I opened it last September. There was an astringent, chemical quality that was unpleasant from the get-go. I know people love this, and I'm also a huge fan of most Jim Beam products so it's possible I didn't get a great bottle. Still, it tastes like a young, cheap craft whiskey with all sharp edges.

Even after 9 months I get strong hints of oak spice and ethanol with a little dusty corn and caramel. No fruit or vanilla. The tannic oak quality jumps out on the tongue and builds on the finish. It's just unpleasant as it lingers on the tongue. At the moment I see few redeeming qualities about this bourbon except to dilute it with Coke. But if I wanted a good cheap BiB I could buy Evan Williams for $10 less. For me this is a hard pass in the future, I'll take Black Label over this in a heartbeat."
