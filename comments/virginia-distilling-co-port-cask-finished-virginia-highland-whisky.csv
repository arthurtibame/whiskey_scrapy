3.25,"Tasting poured neat from 750ml at ABC store, small plastic taster.  Spice and berries, with some grape must coming on.  Decent and interesting, but I must admit I am not a lover of port-finished whisky, so a sample is enough for me.   7/20/19"
3.75,"Good stuff, but too blended"

3.75,"Fruity with a bit of spice, bite grew the longer the pour was out"

4.0,Bright but light sweet flavor. Smooth and minimal burn. Strong after taste.
3.5,Spicy. Has a bite to it that sticks with you. Good for a cold winter night. A bit young but the port finish evens it out.

3.75,"Starts with a port and charred barrel nose. First sip of this is quite smokey. You might even think you were drinking scotch execpt there is an over ripe berry and grape fullness to it. Gives way to a peppery burn that is quite long lasting, but lacks any strong flavors."
4.0,Heavy on the cereal and barley notes. Ever so slight fruit at the very end.
5.0,Perfect flavor profile and smooth as silk on the finish.

4.0,"VA Distilling Co. Port Cask (Batch 12)
Pours into the Glencairn a dark reddish gold.
Nose: Port. Dark Dried Fruits like Raisin and Prune. A Soapy/Perfumey Floral Note. Tea, Old Oak and an occasional hint of Lemon Peel. It also has a heavy ""Boozy"" quality if that makes sense?
Neat: Heavy Mouthfeel. Barrel Notes, Port, Leather, Tea, and a wisp of Smoke. Slightly warming dry finish with Black Pepper and Earthy Oak coating the tongue. You get some accumulating heat on the back of the throat and a Slightly Tannic/Musty Leather aftertaste lingers.
Splash: A little water gives the nose and palate some Extra Spice and a good dose of Vanilla.
Verdict: This was the second sample out of my (3) 375ml pack. I like this one almost as much as I liked the Cider Cask Finish. Being born in the mountains of Southwest VA, I knew I'd be predisposed to liking these, but I've been surprised by how good they actually are. Hope to try the Chardonnay Finish tonight. Another 4 Star."
3.5,"Nose: Floral, very Winey.
Palate: hot. Probably should have added water. Cherry. Sweet. Wood.
Finish: lingers, spice"

2.0,A bit of a funk on the palate for me. I’ll try another bottle just to be sure. This bottle was a 2-star for me.
4.0,A little young but good flavor. Their other whiskies are tasty too. Sweet. Spicy.

4.0,"Nose: Brandied cherries, nougat candy, oak, and cinnamon.

Palate: Rich nougat, tart cherry, tobacco, light notes of cocoa, rather thin mouthfeel.

Finish: Very dry, slow, and not especially intense burn."

3.25,The berry-ness of the port adds a sweetness to augment the grain sweetness. A great taste overall.

Nose: Almonds, nutty, cherry, toffee, cocoa, oak, and plums.

Palate: Coffee, vanilla, oily, peppery, and toasted nuts.

Finish: Medium in length, leather, cinnamon spice, licorice, and oak."
