4.75,"The dram has a potent nose of dark honey, cereal, a distinct leather begotten by oloroso cash finishing, bran muffins, raisin cookies, and Fig Newtons. Palate is semi-sweet, with hazelnuts, yeast extract, oranges, cinnamon, faint nutmeg which then dries into a medium finish with more of the leather and a bit of oak.

The label mentions peat--there's none of that there. It is a part of a broader regional description and, upon investigating the flavor contained within, it seems more a branding mishap as there's not a trace of it--quite plausible given the rather disheveled appearance of the bottle. The sherry cask used was old and musty, about as much so as any sherry cask finishing in scotch can become. After contemplating the roof of my mouth for a few minutes, a slight meat taste emerges along with cocoa powder. The meat lingers and even becomes a bit like steak or Worcestershire sauce. It's not off putting at all; rather, it confirms the presence of well aged scotch aged in a very old used sherry cask."
null,"Sweet vanilla nose, smooth Sherry notes, easy finish with toasty coconut"

4.0,"What the f-Speyside! Complex notes of peat, carnation and honey, with a wonderful sweet and savory palate that carries a touch of salt? How is this so! It's well-balanced from start to finish, and probably what both the Aberfeldy 18 and Tobermory should have tasted like. Well done."

3.75,"Initially came across as a bit harsh but letting it settle really did the trick.   Nice rich sherried notes, reminds me a bit of Fettercairn bottlings. Falls a bit flat on the aftertaste but still another great flora and fauna bottling. 3.75"

4.0,"Honey, leather, berries and brown sugar on the nose. Rich mouthful, with candied fruit, raisins and baking spices on the palate. The finish is dry and lightly spiced. Overall a balanced, complex and delicious sherried whisky. Well worth a try."
4.0,"Super smooth, but not as interesting as some. Mellow sweetness, light spice

Would we buy again: yes"
4.0,"15-21yo whisky is my wheel house! It is the age range I seem to enjoy the most. This Benrinnes 15yo is excellent IMO. I think it offers everything you could expect in a scotch. There are elements of smoke, peat, and sweetness the seem to balance each other perfectly! This a rich, flavor full whisky that is a bit hard to come by in the states. If you have the opportunity to sample or buy a bottle I would be surprised if you were disappointed."

4.0,"Au nez, c'est chargé en arômes mais léger en alcool. Pas mal de fruits confits, peut-être de la figue.
En bouche, c'est d'abord léger mais rond et très boisé puis ça monte bien en arômes.
La finale est longue et riche,  très agréable dans la bouche."
