null,"Only a couple bourbons that I've tried, many including this one recommended by my go-to guy at the liquor store, that I wish I never bought. Dancing Pines is in that category. I'm not capable of breaking down the different components, I just know what I like after drinking several bourbons and ryes. I will not be buying DP again. Simply doesn't taste like a bourbon...more like trying to sip a bottle of cologne!"

1.0,"Super heavy grain flavors; minimal other flavors. Hints of honey and vanilla. 

Overall, I do not plan to purchase this again. There are better products on the market in this price range."
2.0,"I have multiple Dancing Pines products in my liquor cabinet, and enjoyed my trip to the Breckenridge Tasting Room.  However, this will not be a product I buy.  The bite is harsh right of the bat, and the oaky, vanilla, caramel flavors you expect with a bourbon just never show up."
