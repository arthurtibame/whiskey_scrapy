1.0,"This was my first, and luckily not my last. Awful straight - drank half a bottle out of my boot on the Riverwalk in San Antonio and found myself at a wedding. And bad if mixed poorly, the frat standard 7&7 was the only way to go (mixes ok with Mountain Dew, too, if you really want to screw up your system). We took it literally as a 50:50 mix and put on some hair. It really does have a rum-type taste with strong sweet and vanilla characteristics. But take the reviewers' word for it - don't expose yourself to it straight. I still have a nostalgic soft spot for the 7/7; it takes me back to the days when I had less discernment."

1.0,"Day 1 of a 12 Days of Christmas gift set.  There is no nose to speak of.  If I bury my nose in the glass, I get a hint of stale popcorn.  The palate isn't spit-it-out bad, but it's not very good either.  Sweet corn, corn syrup and a touch of vanilla, and you've reached the end.  There's also really no finish.  Maybe just a hint of drying.  This is a drink I haven't had in literally decades, and I can see why.  Were I a college student mixing cheap whisky with generic cola, this would serve the trick of helping me forget how ""horrible"" college life is.  Or something like that.  If you're over the age of 21, and still think this is a decent whisky, may I point you to my trusted friend, Mr Evan Williams Black Label?  Please?  No...really...I'm begging you..."

1.0,"Appearance: In the Glencairn glass, much like myself, it has pretty thin legs. The color according to a nifty chart I found on Whiskey Magazine, is “chestnut oloroso sherry,” which is basically a dark amber / orange; I could have said that to begin with, but I wanted to sound fancy.

Nose: The nose is sweet. And it definitely has grains (which for a blended grain whiskey there should be no surprise there.) I found notes of orange zest and cherry, and beyond that it really vanished for me.

Palate: The body is really smooth with no burn going down. It’s nice for a simple whiskey actually. Although, I’m finding the longer you wait it has more bitter bite on the back of the throat. On the palate I got a note of not quite ripe blackberries, like, the berry is good but you know what it could be. And beyond that there’s nothing more I’m getting. 

Thoughts: Eh. It wasn’t as bad as I was expecting. If someone poured me a glass I would drink it with gratitude! But for the price there are better options. In a highball, sure! I think it’d be a quality whiskey to mix in with ice and soda. Cheers!"

this is a go-to standard for mixers but actually it would be good for sipping as well meat or on the rocks.
