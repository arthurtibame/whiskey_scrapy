4.25,"A very very old single malt from this independent bottler who specializes in great ""comic"" style labels for their bottles. This time a 40yo whisky from dufftown.

Bottled at 47.5%abv.

On the nose, the aroma is perfect. Honey, Maple, Cereal, Cough syrup. Hay,  maraschino cherries syrup and caramelized yemite. Super sweet and beautiful. 

The palate is not as interesting and it is pretty simple for a 40yo whisky. It seems that the long time in the cask has given it an off-putting influence, since it is way too spicy. Oak spice and salty. Can't find much else. 

Aftertaste i also very simple. I got only three notes: hay, dim peat and wet sugar. 

Overall it is very dissapointing to have a 40yo dram with a great nose, that completely falls apart on the palate. I don't think i would recommend this one. Due to my Scoring system this one has an 84/100, but certainly feels like less."
