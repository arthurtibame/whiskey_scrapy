5.0,"This high rye bourbon is caramel syrup in color with thin viscous legs.

The nose has notes of baking and rye spices, apple pie, cherry, warm melted caramel, cinnamon toast, strawberries and cream, and aspen dust.

The palate has an oily mouthfeel and is overall sweet and spicy, with notes of cinnamon spice, breakfast toast, orange candy, and milk chocolate malt balls.

The finish is long and minty.

This fantastic bourbon is complex yet well balanced and one of my favorite products from Distillery 291! Barrel 16, bottle 31/46 is what I am tasting from, but every time I’ve had it, it’s been delicious! I very much recommend! Thanks and cheers!"
