3.0,"I am pleasantly surprised by this bourbon.  I'm not a fan of overly sweet bourbons and this one does not have that characteristic.  It's highlights include a woodiness, orange peel, a little coriander, and a touch of brine.  The finish is medium and the 100 proof is evident.  Overall, I like it.  This will make a nice sipping bourbon for the upcoming winter."

4.0,"good value bourbon. stands up well in a cocktail. needs a bit of dilution on its own. with a cube or two, this is a great daily sipper."
3.0,Signature was surprisingly smoother than their standard 86 proof and Original Batch (90p). Nice mid-shelf smooth bourbon with a balancing burn. Good neat or mixed.

4.0,"Great bourbon. Full flavored, not terribly complex - yet satisfying all the same. Rich caramel, vanilla, butter/butterscotch, oak and just a tad bit of spice - but just right. A great value bourbon if you can find a handle in the sub-$40 range. I've been a fan of the 86 proof OF for 35 years. The Signature is significantly better. I hear from a Brown-Forman peep that there's some OF B'day Bourbon juice in every Signature batch. Interesting, if true."

4.0,"A nice, well-rounded, crowd-pleaser of a bourbon is what we have here. While a little hot on the nose, I got some good mint chocolate, vanilla, and caramel corn notes, with a hint of spice floating around and a little wax. The mouth is waxy and coating, with mint, dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and a peppery, spicy, dill rye note at the end. Not a super long finish, but it's pleasant. It's hard to argue with this given the price, especially considering that it's got enough personality to make a damn fine cocktail, and enough finesse to go down well neat or simply on the rocks."

4.0,"Takes the usual 86 proof version and bumps it up a notch as far as proof and flavor. While the 86 proof is a great intro sipper, this one requires a little more of a mature palette because of the extra heat. Well worth it though as it boasts more oak, more rich honey and more spice. Mixing this would be a shame, but for the price ($24 in FL) you wouldn't miss it too much."

I'm thinking this is pretty young and initially think I would much prefer a HH6 to this.
I'm going to give it some time...but might be asking for requests on what I might be able to vat this with to reduce the wood and astringency."

3.0,"I keep trying Brown Foreman stuff and hoping it'll finally click for me. This is definitely an upgrade from the 86proof. The nose hits you with cherry, coconut, oak shellac and Sherwin Williams latex paint. It's an odd note, similar to the smells of a brand new or freshly painted home. The flavor pretty much mimics the nose. Cherry and coconut, vanilla and that latex paint note. Lots of spice and a hot, slightly astringent finish. A splash or a large cube of ice brings some more oak to the mix and adds some leather, but oddly doesn't really tame the heat. In the words of Randy Jackson, ""It was just a'right for me, Dog"". Possible I'll purchase again, but not likely."

Mild, corn syrup nose with minty notes. On the palate are cherry notes - strong, but not cloying - balanced with orange rind, apple, complex baking spices like allspice and nutmeg, black pepper, and the mint notes return.

Thin body with a slight oily feel.  Lingering cinnamon finish with medicinal rye notes on the tongue. No flaws and some pleasant but less common flavors - nice for the price.  Only knock is it isn’t the traditional palate for a bourbon and not much nose."

Tasting neat.  Rich, caramel sweet, cherries to the point of medicinal, balanced by some heat, spice and wood.  Medium sweet finish.   Similar to Woodford Reserve (same distillery), but a bit more towards the dessert side.. Sweeter, less wood/char/smoke, and more kick.  Adding a cube of ice cut the heat and brought the medicinal cherry down to a heavy fruit level and allowed some more delicate spices and sugars to show up.  Still dessert like, but much more balanced.  I would definitely recommend some water/ice.  Sippable, but probably not in my top 10 on it's own, but I can't think of many that would make a better mixer, especially for the price. This would make a mean old fashioned or manhattan."

3.0,"My initial impression was that there was nothing to distinguish this from the 86 proof. But I have learned to give new whiskeys a few tries before I make judgement. This one definitely had more to say after I gave it some time. The Rye presence is much more pronounced, there is a lot more of the pumpernickel funky notes and black pepper and cinnamon than I remember from the 86 proof. I would not put this on a pedestal with respect to other low-cost Bourbons, however given the proof and the spicy rye presence it would be a great dram to have on hand for cocktails, and it's a more than decent drink on its own. 3.5"

Third night into this and I'm really beginning to enjoy it's initial taste. It has such a nice vanilla overtone and it's almost sweet and maple syrup in a sense. While my initial rating was 3.75, I'm now updating this as it's growing on me quickly... Think of dessert when eyeing this bottle...

Fifth try in and it just keeps getting better. The overall vanilla profile on the initial taste is remarkable. I just really enjoy this whisky. I keep finding it astonishing that it has such a full flavor profile after the initial sweetness of the vanilla. Such a great whisky, will never not have this on hand...

4.25,"Wasn't planning on picking this one up so soon, but noticed 2 bottles on the shelf recently at $23, so I had to grab one after enjoying the 86 more than I expected to.  Likely around the same age as their Classic 86, you just get more bang for your buck in the higher 100 proof.  Let's see if it's worth the modest premium over the entry level 86!

Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn, no added water.  On the nose, it smells like a classic bourbon profile of sweet butterscotch and brown sugar, vanilla, some apple fruitiness, hint of chocolate, and toasted oak with hints of cedar or pine mintiness. Some corn ethanol burn in there too.  Definitely amped up and more fragrant from the weaker 86.  

On the palate I immediately notice the slightly thicker, more oily feel than the Classic 86.  Upon entry, you are hit hard with very heavy baking spices of strong clove and nutmeg and drinks much hotter/spicier than the Classic 86; really wakes up the palate in comparison.  The only thing close for me in this category with such high spice would come from Turkey 101, although it’s more cinnamon heavy instead of the baking spices here, but both bring the heat for sure.  After the explosion of spices, you can pick out a bit of orange citrus mixed with other fruits maybe apricot, and dark chocolate to almost a coffee note, and burnt sugars.  Reminds me of something like chocolate dipped cherries and orange peels with a side of caramels.  Not an overly sweet bourbon but not bitter either, nice balance.  Good hearty oak flavors with maple bring up the back end of the sip.  Did I mention the hot spices?   The bang here for the modest $3 premium over the Classic 86 is crazy!  The flavors come in waves with OFS, starting with the heavy spices, then a transition to fruits and darker notes of chocolate, and finally to an oaky maple finish.  Quite good at this price!  

Finish is long with maple syrup, tobacco, caramel, more fruit, lingering spice that cools/tingles the entire mouth, and toasted oak with hints of cedar/pine.  Nice!

Overall, a much spicier, bolder, more flavorful version of the OF Classic 86!  If you like it spicy and kicked up with richer flavors, definitely spend the $3 over the 86!  At this price point, may become one of my daily favorites.  At 100 proof in the low $20s, compares very favorably to my stronger favorites in Turkey 101 or Beam Distillers Cut.  All offer high spiciness and plenty of character and flavor from their respective distillery and great value at the same proof level.  Although at least $10 more expensive, my favorite 100 proofer is still the McKenna 10 year for its darkness, richness, depth, and complexity. The OFS is a fantastic value for a strong yet classic bourbon with fairly complex waves of flavor!  Highly recommended!   Cheers!"

3.5,"After trying most of the “higher end” old forester offerings, I thought I’d give this one a try.

The nose is sweet with some fruit (plumb), freshly baked bread, and a little bit of chocolate.
The palate is semi-sweet, nice and oily, starting out with some fruit then some Barrel.
A tiny bit of bitterness on the finish, which is about medium length.

I was pleasantly surprised by this being how affordable it is at 100 proof and not being overly ethanolly."

3.5,"Pale reddish straw color - thin body but reasonably oily legs.

Thin nose with inescapable ethanol that prevents a long nosing, but not harsh.  Mint, vanilla, brown sugar and cereal grain with some cherry notes.

A sharp oak and mint open the taste, that fades to coat the mouth in a syrupy, candied vanilla sweetness.  Some citrus rind, baking spices, and tart cherry.  The finish holds the sweet syrup notes, lingering impressively and outshining the palate.

With only a half ounce left in the bottle it has definitely grown on me since opening.  I think that’s a deeper appreciation for the OF profile and some palate maturity on my part.  A very solid bottle if found in the low $20s. Finish > Palate > Nose."

4.0,"This was one of the most pleasant surprises of our recent three-day trip to the Bourbon Trail.  Old Forester 100 Proof is a very affordable bourbon, going for as little as $20 in some places and widely available for under $25 -- right around, if not slightly under, the price point of Wild Turkey 101.  To be honest, it may have supplanted Wild Turkey 101 as my favorite bourbon at this price point.  Although Old Forester bottles its bourbons at a younger age than most distilleries (even its more expensive expressions may be 5 or 6 years old), they taste almost double that age, with loads of brown sugar, rich, slightly oily cornbread, sweet buttered corn, and a healthy dollop of spice."

Very little wood and even at 100pr almost no ethanol. Heavy mouthfeel brings a blast of caramel, cinnamon and spice transitioning to oak. Very robust with strong heat(not burn though) Finishes medium long with drying oak and cinnamon with warming sensation all the way down. This bourbon is deep and rich and swings a heavy bat, huge improvement over regular 86pr. I think it represents superb execution of a standard bourbon profile. Its sweet but not too so, oak dryness but not bitter. It has plenty of heat but is not harsh. Most palates will deviate to individual preferences but OF Sig is kinda like the baseline imo, only cranked up several notches(this one goes to 11) There are others that I prefer for sure but at this price point it is elite. 88/100- will happily purchase again"

Palate:
Rich, layered with baking spices and heaps and heaps of orange zest and wood. 
It almost drinks like a strong cocktail. 
Proof does shine through so, it’s hot.

Finish:
Once the proof heat dwindles, the vanilla and caramel softens everything up. Citrus and cherry continues, ending with a barrel bite."

3.5,"I love what Brown-Foreman is doing innovation wise with the Whiskey Row Series, the creative mashbills on Woodford Malt and Wheat, the introduction of Single Barrel and Barrel Proof Jack, and the cocktail culture they promote with their own line of bitters, etc. I have not been enamored with the standard and Signature Old Forester, but after a couple years I decided to give the OF100 another shot.
NOSE: The latex paint note I get from BF bourbons is front and center, but hey, I love Cascade Hollow products despite the Flintstone Vitamin note, so maybe I can get past this note as well. Let it breathe for awhile and you are rewarded with notes of Cooked Cherries, Coconut, Oak Shellac, and a little Heat. A little more time yields notes of Almonds and Sugar Cookie Dough. 
NEAT: Medium mouthfeel. You're immediately hit with Varnished Oak. Cherry, Coconut, Vanilla, Dark Chocolate, and cinnamon show up as well. A little Astringent and a Pleasantly Warming Kentucky Hug on the finish. The Palate gets a light coating of Vanilla, Cherry, and Mild Astringent Oak. It's not as clingy as I like.
SPLASH: A little water gives the Nose and Palate a good bit of Maple Syrup. Ups the Polished Oak notes as well. The mouthfeel becomes a little creamier and the finish takes on a hint of Salted Butter. 
VERDICT: I liked this much better than I remembered. Maybe my tastebuds are gravitating more toward the BF Profile. To me, it's almost tropical with the cherry and coconut notes. I can definitely see this becoming part of the everyday rotation. It also helps that it cocktails well."

4.0,"I am a huge fan of the Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style bourbon, but its $60 price tag makes it a little too pricey to be a daily drinker. Thankfully, there are a number of less expensive Old Forester labels, so I decided to pick up a bottle of the Signature 100 Proof Bourbon. The color alone has me excited for something good and the budget price point is simply an added bonus. Before serving myself a neat pour, I take a deep whiff from the bottle and I like what I smell.

The nose is packed with vanilla, caramel, and cherry. It smells like I'm about to drink an ice cream sundae. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and the palate brings chocolate and oak into the mix. There is a slight black pepper heat in the back of the throat and a warm, but all too short finish. I was looking for a cheaper, younger brother to the 1920 Prohibition Style and I have found it. The Signature 100 Proof has similar tasting notes to the 1920 but is not as complex, which was to be expected. Easy drinking at an easy price will keep this in my collection, and in my mouth, from here on out."

3.5,"Over all, not a bad bourbon.

The nose- hints of vanilla, cinnamon, chard oak.

The palate- mild intro with a gradual increase in the ""hug"" with hints of vanilla and cinnamon and decent oil texture.

The finish- was much longer than expected and appealing. The proof isnt high at all and therefore not a bad burn.

In conclusion- I'm definitely going to purchase this again. The Old Forester signature 100 proof, in my opinion, is a good choice for a ""daily"" drink or in better terms, a bourbon you would consume more commonly.
As always, please enjoy responsibly."
3.5,"Good straightforward 100 proofer. Alcohol burn to start the nose, into some oakiness and spice. Seems like high rye content. Pretty short finish. No complaints but would rather grab the of rye. Less than $15 with a costco combo pack with 1920."

4.0,"This is my 200th review. 

Coming back to this bottle after about a month and man does it deliver. For me it’s hard to find a bourbon under $30 that beats this. The staples are just as good — Buffalo Trace, Four Roses, Elijah Craig, Woodford, and Makers Mark — but for my taste this is just as rich and spicy if you like higher rye as Woodford but not as oaky. 

Nose: dusty corn, earthy vanilla, leather, baking spices, honey

Taste: nutmeg, a little more vanilla and honey and some brown sugar  — it’s quite rich and spot on as far as the proof goes, any less (OF86) and you lose some complexity and you get a thinner sip. Any higher and you really need to extra oak to round things out as far as the Brown Forman mashbill goes (like Old Forester 1920 and others). 

Finish: a little eucalyptus hit at the end, medium finish with a little more vanilla at the end. 

I tasted this up against a Four Roses single barrel pick and the FR won but not by much."

The usual. 15 min rest in GC

N(4.25): cherry vanilla oak all come at once. Get some type of spice. Get chocolate right before a slight ethanol bite. Score would be hire if it was more bold. Bats way higher than its price. 
P(4): nice tongue coat. Sweet honey berries. Pulled a bunch saliva forward. Hints of banana
F(3.75): slight hug. Vanilla sweet cream then then honey oak comes in. Not long or bold but pleasant. Banana oak comes on a couple of sips in.

Overall: $20 is what I’ve seen it for. One of the best bottom shelf in my opinion. I will have to blind it, but I actually prefer this over Eh Taylor. Definitely buy and stock"

Lots more fruit on the taste, including the berries, but more if they were a jelly or jam. There's burnt sugar here as well, but honestly a little too far burnt. At first I thought the oak flavor (which is also a bit faint) was young and raw, but it has the same suffering as aforementioned, with a burnt flavor, but no proof or depth to really show from that. 

There's something about this that definitely does not work well with me. Perhaps it's an interesting note of a berry cobbler where the crumble topping was torched terribly too long. Also worth noting is that 100 proof, which is not low by any means, is not really detected by taste or finish."
