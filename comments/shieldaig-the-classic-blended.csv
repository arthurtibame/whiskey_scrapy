3.5,Tart grape with a bit of honey. Dry finish with slight smoke and bitterness. Not bad for a value blended scotch
2.75,"Fresh cut grass, hay, almond biscotti and nail polish on the nose, weird combo and they are all quite faint, the palate is pleasantly smooth and creamy with a little honey, the finish is short with a little bitter after taste."
3.0,Easy for the price but I’ve had better.
