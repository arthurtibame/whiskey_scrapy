4.0,"When the label says ""distilled from cane and grain"", you know its pretty basic..but.
The thing is, this has a corny nose and a corny taste but finishes smooth. There is just something about this I like, it wont ""WOW"" you but doesn't dissapoint. Tried it's competition,  Old Smokey....much perfer the taste of this. First found it at the distillery in Gatlinburg, has been a favorite shine since."
