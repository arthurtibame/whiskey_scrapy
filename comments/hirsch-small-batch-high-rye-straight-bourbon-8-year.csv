2.0,"Nose is definitely a heavy rye smell, with some barrel spice in there as well. Taste is nothing but rye with a very spicy, peppery finish"
4.0,"Nose- A lot of baking spices
Body- Cinnamon and rye spice very prominent but not overpowering 
Finish- easy finish with more baking spices and just a hint of pickle brine (not too much this time) 

This has s strong rye prominence but I like it. It has a very nice easy finish."

Taste: Light spices, has a juicy somewhat velvety mouth feel. Hint on oak, licorice, cherry with the slightest note of Dill that lingers for a while."

3.75,"This is nice bourbon.  Has a nice rye kick but very drinkable neat. Rye, vanilla, butterscotch.  No strong burn but plenty of spice.   I picked up a couple bottles in OR for 30$ each.  Lucky me,  that price it's a great value."

3.75,Nice spice and a hint of vanilla at the end.
4.25,The spice is beautiful and lasting only to be smoothed out by a subtle sweetness.
5.0,"Wonderfully balanced. High Rue, so has some spice, but smooth as well. A bit of vanilla and caramel. Won our informal tasting."

4.0,Really enjoying this. More butterscotch than I was expecting.  Intense spice up front balanced by a surprising amount of sweetness.
4.25,Bartender recommended this one. Very complex! Like it a lot!
4.0,Excellent depth of flavor. Opened up nicely with some air time.
3.0,"So, this was an exciting find/research realization. As I thought the other day about what my bourbon and general whiskey ""stats"" are, this hits a lot of them; great age, high rye, decent proof, decent color, and average price. When I lay it out like that, it doesn't sound all that exciting, but given the sea of sub-par and bleak competitors out there, this one seemed to shine as something different.

The nose has really nice spiced rye, vanilla, and caramel notes, but it all rides on a bright, fruity body. I even feel like I get some banana, perhaps covered in a sugary glaze.

During the taste, I almost immediately keep thinking of that fruity/banana nose from before, as that taste starts to come through with a sugary, fruit salad vibe. The body was the only thing I was worried about (due to the proof), but honestly, this flavor likely wouldn't taste much better at a stronger proof. That vanilla and caramel from the nose is totally missing, though. The finish is mouth coating, but leaves a lot to be desired. When they say high rye, I believe it, but unfortunately, neither potent rye spice or sweet corn seem to come through, which makes me wonder what a younger version of this distillate tastes like, and if it would work better.

Hopefully it wasn't just general excitement or perhaps resentment at spending $50 for a bit of a let-down, but the first few sips were really working for me. However, as I kept going, I feel like this is more of a cocktail bourbon, which would be fine, if I didn't already have plenty of underwhelming products that already take that title. There's something about it, though, that I look forward to finding out perhaps on a re-taste."

3.0,Spicy for sure. A bit of water cooled it down to reveal rich vanilla and caramel or maybe butterscotch.
