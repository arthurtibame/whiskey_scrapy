3.0,"wow does that change with a drop of water!! hot hot hot. before it's mellow and no bite at all and with water it's very tame, no bite and smooth but not a ton of character"
4.0,There’s a lot of flavor and intrigue going on which is surprising given its low proof. Fresh fruit and minty with a great long finish. Highly recommended.

3.0,"***NOT A RYE FAN*** I do not love the Rye’s so please consider the source. It is ok at best. Mild flavor with low burn/spice. This should please mild bourbon drinkers, but will  definitely disappoint the seasoned vets. Will not look to buy in the future.  ( This was a gift). 2.6/5"

2.0,Weak/thin. Comes on with a nutty taste with a sugary quality. The middle palate is almost absent. The finish is light wood.

3.0,"I first had this months ago, at a tasting, where I was pleasantly surprised.  Maybe it hid behind all the other samples I had.  I walked out of that tasting liking two samples I had: this and a Knob Creek cask strength rye.  I liked this enough to buy a bottle.  This time around, I was just plain disappointed. I finally opened it tonight to share with a few colleagues.  It seems as if the bourbon and rye really just didn’t play well together here.  Flavors seem muddled between the two, each fighting for dominance.  I’m all up for innovative experimentation, although this rye-bourbon marriage isn’t innovative anymore, it’s been tried and tested by others that have done a much better job in execution ( High West Bourye).  But innovative experimentation is only as good as the execution.  This is a case where I thought the rye isn’t exerting itself, nor is the bourbon.  Ideally, it should’ve been the sweetness of the bourbon up front, followed by the spicy rye on finish.  But, this has both arm wrestling throughout.  Try at bar, buy a bottle, or skip?  I’d say try at bar."
5.0,"Bit of spicyness, but still plenty sweet to the bourbon side"

4.0,"11 dollar pour at bar, neat first than small amount of water. 
Easy sipper you can taste both rye and bourbon like their fighting for dominance lightly.
Different but no wow factor, nothing hangs on the tongue.
Good beginner rye."
5.0,Super smooth. Hints of vanilla and a little nutty finish.

2.75,Solid rye not overly special in my opinion.
2.75,A fun blend but comes off very light. The rye is too young to be mixed making it just add a different sweetness to the already sweet bourbon. Good light sipper but not at the price point.

3.5,"Neat. I love my bourbon and like my ryes. This was a good blend of both - 2 bourbons and 2 ryes, thus 2x2. Not the best I have ever had and not the worst. Good for the price. I have not had a basil haydens that I don’t like but none that I love either. 

""0-1: Beyond bad. Complete waste of money according to my tastebuds. 
2: Bad. Simply not my taste
2.5: Sub-par. Ill drink it... but only because its whiskey.
3: Good. Decent stuff, but not a rebuy
3.5: Very good. I might buy again
4: Excellent: Will be purchasing a bottle asap
4.5: Incredible: top of the purchase list
5:Amazing: cost and taste are worth every cent"""
3.75,"N: vanilla and orange, a bit of rye bread but less grain than your average rye

P: orange peel and pear dominate the front, followed by a classic oaky mid-palate.

F: soft rye bite with lingering Woody flavors

Very nice pour overall. Good whisky but not for the rye diehard."
