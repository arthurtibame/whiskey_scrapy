4.0,"It's great young and fresh bourbon. Vanilla, apple, banana to taste.
It's not for wintertime nor night time   sipping. When it's summer and the sun is shining you can enjoy this wonderful bourbon on ice. Great for mixing too."

3.0,It was fairly standard.  Fine for mixing.
2.0,Very non-descript. I wouldn't have it again. At least the price for a double in the Albuquerque airport was reasonable
