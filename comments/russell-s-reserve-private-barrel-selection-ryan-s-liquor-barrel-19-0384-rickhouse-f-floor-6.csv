4.25,"Cherry Bomb! Stone fruits hit the nose immediately then trails to vanilla and oak. Palate starts with cherry coke and as you chew, Granny Smith apple shows up on the back of the tongue. Definitely mouth watering! As it sits and breathes, toasted marshmallow appears both on the nose and palate. The finish is warm and inviting with that special Kentucky hug. Warmer than the 110 proof would lead you to believe which I personally like. The vanilla and oak really come alive in the fairly long finish as well."
