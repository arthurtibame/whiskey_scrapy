2.0,"Light brown sugar and vanilla nose. Nothing sticks out as far as flavor. Finish is too harsh for sub-100 proof, and the mild flavor profile."

3.0,A solid 3.  I didn't find this single barrel to be spectacular or poor.  Id likely go with a different bottle next time.

4.5,"This first Cask Strength Pinhook release was bottle at 115.3 proof and has a deep and bright nose of Creme Brûlée, orange zest, and toasted coconut, which sets the stage for a rich and harmonious palate of pralines, brioche, cocoa, and candied cinnamon. This release recently won Gold at the 2019 San Francisco World Spirits Competition."
