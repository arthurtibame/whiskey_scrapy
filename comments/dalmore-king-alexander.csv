3.0,"Nose: Malt and chocolate with hints of fruity notes.

Taste: Liqueury with spices. Delicate blend of dark chocolate and biscuits. This is very smooth, I mean VERY.

Finish: Oak with peppery notes in a very brief finish.

Balance: Nicely balanced, sophisticated and smooth. Lacks quite a bit character and way, way too quick finish – that's why so low score."

Definitely shouldn't need any water here, it's already at 80 proof and water would just whittle away the balance they've achieved.  As nice as this is to drink though, it's not actually worth the price in my opinion.  Too expensive for what is not an overly interesting scotch.  But great if you get a bottle as a gift!"

Luckily, I never did and instead sampled from my friend's collection. To summarize my opinion in a single word: disappointment. I mean I liked it, but at that price point and considering there are SIX casks at play here, you'd expect more. Like maybe the mountains trembling and the seas roaring. Alas neither occurred, and that's a damn shame. This whisky is sherried to the nose, with a palate rich in cinnamon and almonds. The finish doesn't play nice with the overall experience, being a tad bitter. Yeah... disappointing."

It's extremely complex, and probably needs a full bottle experience to get every nuance out of it. From first impressions though, the nose would drift from fruity sherry, to wine/port, to floral and even sweet vanilla biscuits. The palate and finish were sublime too, but overall a bit on the sweet end. It's like a catchy glam rock anthem that you are embarrassed to enjoy. 300 greenbacks? I don't know... maybe. There was an actual offering I enjoyed more from Dalmore than this one, so I think I'd save my money for that one instead."

Taste - Fairly thin, sweet/savory, soy & mushrooms, light salt/brine, savory fruit, dark chocolate, lightly tannic, light spicy tingle, musty mushrooms.

Finish - Lingering savory/salty/fruity sweet, mushroom funk, sweet soy/teriyaki.

Score - 60/100

Final Thoughts - I guess I'm just not a fan of Dalmore? You can definitely tell that there are some older whiskies in this blend, but it has this weird oddly sweet savory mushroom funk that is very off putting to my palate. Maybe Dalmore is meant to be enjoyed mostly with cigars as I can see how the sweet might be offset by some sweet smoky tobacco of a cigar? Regardless, this had this weird mushroom funk throughout that I typically wouldn't mind, but it just combines with this oddly weird soy/teriyaki like sweet that's just a bit off-putting to my palate.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.0,"This dram was the last of a vertical Dalmore tasting that we just attended.  For such an expensive scotch, weighing in at $280 or so a bottle, I was hoping for something more.  This is similar to, yet milder than, the 18-year old, but it's too nondescript to justify its soaring price tag.  The distinctive notes that distinguish it from its younger and less expensive siblings are a creamy hazelnut and toffee or caramel flavors that make this whisky seem like the least sherry-influenced of the bunch."

4.5,"I’ve had this bottle sitting in my collection for probably the better part of two years.  I paid a pretty high price for it (~ $240) and I was expecting it to be pretty phenomenal.  It advertised an in-house mix of 6 different styles of wine cask aged single malt, which Dalmore mastermind Richard Paterson concocted, and was supposed to be the epitome of Dalmore’s core range.

It’s a beautiful (color added) mahogany and produced a ton of huge, watery and fat droplets in the Glencairn.  It was watery and oily, but still clings to the sides for quite a while after you spin it.  I groaned when I thought about the ABV:  40%.  Oh boy...

The nose is super fruity.  Lots of wine cask influence here:  sweetness, sugary notes and overall vine fruit.  There’s an ever present caramel and toffee creme candy note hanging around, but there’s a nice dry oak presence and even some berries coming through after a little bit of time.  Pleasant enough to start.

The palate struck me as overly watery the instant it hit my tongue.  It felt like there was nothing clinging to my tastebuds whatsoever.  A hefty sherry and raspberry note materialized and it turned the mouth feel rather velvety.  Some weak woody notes formed a solid backbone, but there’s just no heat at all.  

The finish is short-ish with a light effervescent quality and a nice, fine oak feel.  There’s still no heat and I have to declare this a dessert dram of the highest caliber.  Nothing else springs up in surprise and there’s really no lingering notes.  It washes away painlessly- unlike a lot of other Dalmore offerings I’ve had to this point.

That’s where this one wins me over- after having had the 12, 15, 18 and Cigar Malt I always balked at the harshness on the finish.  Well, it’s finally gone with the King Alex.  Even though this one has to be considered a pure dessert whisky, it’s still damn fine.  4.5 stars- and although I can’t say the value for your dollar is there, I’m not going to dock points because of it.  This is a classically great Dalmore.  Cheers, my friends."

Le nez est super, le palais l’est un poil moins.

On retrouve dans le KA le meilleur du 18 et du 15, à savoir le sherry et le boisé du 18, en encore meilleur et le chocolat et la poire du 15"

4.0,"Whisk(e)y: The Dalmore: King Alexander III

Nose:

The nose on the KA3 is remarkable. It’s a combination of the following six casks it sits in: bourbon, sherry, Marsala, Madeira, port and the eloquent Cabernet sauvignon. 

To the nose this is a nice dance between the different casks. I can really get the port and cabernet sauvignon along with the bourbon barrels. That spiciness on the nose reminded me of a fine bourbon. A slight hint of walnut. I had to let this sit for 15 minutes and a few swirls in order to find that note. With all off the casks involved I would have expected something a more fierce, but then again, this is a 40% abv and a NAS. 
 
Palate:

 On the back of the tongue you can taste raisin, a subtleness of blueberry (hard to pick out if you don’t nose the hell out of it) and marmalade. 

Overall: 

I try to put price aside to when reviewing drams. Keyword, “try”. This one in particular I picked up due to having a shit load of gift cards bringing the price of this under $50. Is it worth the purchase at that? Yes. Is it worth paying full price for? No. This is one of these bottles I would snag if retail pricing was $150 and under. I personally found some of the other expressions in their line up more catered towards me. It’s no disrespect towards their product as this has been barreled and molested 6 fold, yet, it doesn’t really pack a punch. I appreciate a fine dram, and this is one of them, but the other scotches reviewed have different variations of wonderful experiences at a lower cost.

Dalmore Ranking:
1.)	Dalmore 18
2.)	Cigar Malt
3.)	Dalmore 12
4.)	King Alexander III (too expensive and didn’t live up to the hype)
5.)	Dalmore 15
6.)	Dalmore Port Wood Reserve"

Like so thin it’s almost refreshing. Sip 2: ok, this is a truly odd drink. So easy drinking it doesn’t even come across as whisky. I can’t decide if it’s remarkably drinkable or remarkably weird. So thin, yet so smooth and drinkable. I noticed more lemon flavor and citrus this time. I had my wife taste it and in her words, “I love it. Really, really light, and feels good inside”. Third sip: I’m still conflicted. It’s not my favorite, scotch, but was still compelled to drink to the last drop. I could think of more than one friend ld like to serve this to."

The most standout part of this whiskey for me was the nose. It ranges from a really nice Werther's Original butter caramel to a sweet wafer cookie. There is also a bit of raisins in there too.

The taste is super smooth. Dried berries and blackberry preserves are the most apparent flavors. The finish is more of the same with a touch of honey."

4.5,"I have long awaited to taste this legendary whisky. Is it good? It is wonderful. Is it what i expected to be... maybe not. Lets start saying why is it so mystical. It has been matured in six different casks, six wood finishes: matusalem oloroso, port pipes, marsala, madeira, cabernet sauvignon, american white oak.

Bottled at 40% abv, with a lovely mahogany color. 

On the nose it is outstanding. Just plain beautiful. Berries. Jam. Nutmeg. Wedding cake. Dark cake. There is a citric note there. Red fruits. Cold red fruits (winter berries). It is exactly as a cold pressed antioxidant juice that is sold here in Ecuador called ""D'hoy frutos rojos"".

On the palate is where i expected more. I really hoped it will blow my mind away but was a little straightforward, somehow mimic the nose losing some of the complexity it had there. Still a great and interesting dram. It has that Dalmore typical wood flavor. There is a sweet but woody flavor. Peppermint. Reminded me a lot as glenfiddich 21yo winter storm, specially on the nose. I believe it is a little straightforward and not that complex. 

The aftertaste is eternal. Full ginger spiciness there. Incredible.

My actual score for it was 95 over 100, due to this:

Nose 25/25
Palate 22/25
Finish 25/25
Balance 23/25.

Maybe i am too ""picky"" over this one because i had high hopes on it. It is a wonderful dram, i believe it is worthy for the $150-170 that it costs, and you should definitively try it, for me, cigar malt is slightly better. It doesn't feel as an old dram, i don't believe the six wood finishes fully get there, but as i said before, it is a wonderful whisky. Slainte!"

5.0,"100/100 easy. If you’re into sherry and sweeter casks this is one of the most impressive drams for me. The Dalmore 18 is bollocks compared to this. King Alexander is incredibly mature and old on the nose. An array of chocolates, freshly toasted nuts and the mixture of casks come at you on the nose. The finish is dessert and unbelievably smooth. I definitely prefer this over Signet, which is also excellent. But in all honesty, I think King Alexander is one of the greatest whiskies ever made."
3.0,"Fantastic pour. I expected more complexity, given that it’s aged in six different casks, but the barrels work more in symphony than in competition. Lots of sweet notes are apparent right off the bat, with a floral bite of apple and caramel with slight hints of cardamom and clove. Toffee and vanilla linger on the pallet. Personally, I don’t prefer this sweet of a taste profile, but I also would never complain if this was poured: when it’s done this well (and even more so when paired with a good cigar) what’s not to love."

3.75,"After a bit of research, I quickly realized this isn’t named after the Greek conqueror Alexander the Great.  I always wondered what Alexander possibly had in common with whisky.  His conquests were from Greece to modern day Pakistan. Nothing to do with Scotland.  Instead, much to my chagrin, this was named after King Alexander III, who gave the McKenzie clan a 12 point stag as the clan emblem, after their clan leader saved his ass from a charging stag.  Generations later, in mid1800s, a descendent of that clan leader established the Dalmore distillery, and had the 12 point stag as the emblem.  
Cute backstory.  But let’s get to the point that really matters: this whisky, graciously given as a sample by my buddy @LeeEvolved.  

A bit more research also reveals that there’s really some cask finishing gone overtime here.  Normally you get one or two finishes.  No, not this one...it’s 6 finishes !  Finished in Kentucky bourbon casks , Jerez Oloroso, Sicilian Marsala, Douro valley port , Cabernet savignon ( maybe France?), and Madeira ( from...guess where?  Madeira!).   

Despite that it’s only 40% ABV, I’m getting this biting heat on the nose.  It really needs to sit a bit and calm down.  Once it does, you get a mix of aromas—-from berries to caramel to floral.  Palette is a step down—was really hoping that it would live up to that nose.  Getting more Christmas flavors of nutmeg and oranges.  Wouldn’t be a Dalmore if there were no oranges. 

Fantastic experiment in casks finishing that works wonders on the nose, but really falls apart at the palette. 

Thanks Lee for the pour!"
