3.75,"Cinnamon moonshine from a new distiller local to Franklin Pennsylvania.

This corn whiskey is diluted to 35% ABV so it is very smooth with almost no bite.  The cinnamon flavor is a great balance of sweet and spicey.  Color is clear and un-aged with the cinnamon flavor settled to the bottom, shaking required for this small batch moonshine!"
