5.0,"I'm not going to be very original here, but this whiskey was delivering in my opinion all that I can ask to a drink. Complex, multi-layered and a taste never ending. Loved it and I just wish I had one more bottle right now!"

5.0,Favorite bourbon of 2013
5.0,Some great age and barrel notes on the nose. Delicious bourbon.
5.0,Easily one of the top bourbons I've ever tried. The complexity and smoothness of the barrel was so good. The blend is one of a kind.
5.0,"""Now that's a bourbon!"" said a friend. Big, bold, and a long finish to keep you warm in the winter. This stuff is the real deal."

5.0,"I'm dead serious when I say this is quite possibly the best bourbon I've ever tasted. Huge cherry and cherry liqueur flavours. Vanilla, big caramel, sawdust. Cinnamon, nutmeg, raspberry, peaches, plum, cocoa. Cola. Orange jelly. Apple pie. Mint, some dusty rye. Delicious. Rich, big body, beautiful texture. Barrel proof flavour without a conventional barrel-proof alcohol kick. It's obviously long-gone from the shelves, but I've got two bottles tucked away for major life events."
