Initial palate is wonderful, strong notes of brown sugar, toasted oak, and a vague sense of leather that's actually quite pleasant. Mid-palate brings deep layers of apricot, fruit, vanilla, and a hint of char. Mild taste of oak tannins.  Long, satisfying finish of fruit, brown sugar, and toasted oak."

2.0,Just not that interesting -- now I have a bottle I'll have to drink at some point.  The bourbon expert at Total Wine raved about this -- I should have known better.  Give me Old Grand Dad Bonded any day of the week over this.   Looks like an Elmer T Lee bottle -- not in the same league.

    The strong peanut scents remind me of Heaven Hill (perhaps the source of this juice?), which I like, and that's coupled with banana and a bit of char. So this smells like an Elvis Presley sandwich. On the palate, honey roasted peanuts and wood. A bitter aftertaste remains (think pecan shells), and gets stronger as you go. Short finish. Adding some limestone water brought out some vanilla on the nose. I do like this, but again, I would enjoy it a lot more if it were $10 cheaper. 6/21/17"

It's actually quite easy to drink - deceptively smooth for 94 proof, light (almost refreshing, even), with a sweet vanilla and caramel corn profile, lightly dusted with some baking spices. And...that's about it, and that's the issue. Imagine you're out on a date with someone who is nice enough, and kinda cute, even...but has zero personality. Are you going out on a second date? Yeah, me neither. THAT'S this bourbon's fault - it's just kinda nice. You can do worse, but you can also do so much better."

Aroma: caramel, vanilla, toffee, cinnamon, light nutmeg, faint alcohol, whips of apricot 
Flavor: First sip, dried apricots, raw oak. Pie crust. Second sip: cinnamon apples, lemon drops, pumpernickel bread. 
Mouthfeel: Pretty darn smooth, just a little rough around the edges. Medium body. Low burn. 
Overall: Quite nice! Especially for the price. A drier bourbon with a fair amount of complexity, albeit subtle. A touch more sweetness could help tie it all together. The initial smoothness gets quite rough by the end of a neat glass."

3.5,"I was looking to try another ~$30 small batch but spotted this, and an ABC employee said they just got it in that day. I couldn't exactly remember reviews of this, but I knew it was not a bourbon we normally see in North Carolina so I impulsively picked it up due to the small quantity available. I usually wait to do reviews until I'm almost finished with the bottle but I think my opinion is settled after a few days. 

This is unlike a lot of bourbons I've had recently. It hits you hard with floral oak notes, smelling like it is over 100 proof. It initially is light on the palate but then a strong oak and nut flavor takes over. The finish however lingers with a more spicy dessert flavor mixed with nuts and cloves. To me this is floral, oak, and nutty. It lacks sweetness that many other bourbons have, which could be due to age since the mash bill is similar to many big bourbons I've had recently. If you like more rye/malt influence in your bourbon you may like this a lot. A unique bourbon that is a good change of pace, but not something that I'd consider a good daily sipper.

By the way, adding a little water only dulled the nose and flavor. And I really like the bottle design. It pours easily with no dribbling. And the boxy shape has dimples on the side making it comfortable to grab. More bottles should include dimples.

Barrel information - #4696 and bottled on 05-06-19. I wish they included the cask date, I'm confident it is under 6 years given the taste."

( I never leave a liquor store empty handed).  This time I chose Wathen's single barrel.  The price was $40.00 for  750ml jug.  First...this spirit's proof fights above it's weight.  It has a 100 proof ""feel"" on the palate.  I found this spirit to have an unusual after taste that I can't associate with other bourbons with a corn heavy mashbill....more of a Scotch taste...Needless to say....NO....I don't know what's in it....but it seemed a bit overbearing.  NOT A DAILY sipper.  Wathen's DOES have a cool decanter....like Elmer T's.  Square bottle with indentations, nice cork/barrel info on the side.  OVERALL...I'd rate this spirit a 3.25 for for a unique flavor and a half star for the decanter. Wathen's HAS been added to my collection....not so much for flavor....but as a simi hard to find spirit with a cool decanter.   CHEERS to ALL!"

Light, floral nose with notes of creamed corn and a sweet note I can't quite identify.  It's delicate. Theres a lot going on, but none of it is in your face.  There is a bit of barrel char that wraps sweet notes into a chorus of flavor. 

On the tongue, the profile is similarly delicate with slight white pepper at the beginning, followed by ginger, sasparilla, and creamed corn. There's a hint of honey that leads into a long, silky and warm vanilla finish.

The finish on this bottle is sublime.  Capsacin and black pepper play off honey and vanilla, finally leaving a sweet, oily mouthfeel and deep heat.

Single barrels... every now and then you get a masterpiece. This is one of them."

3.0,"Wathen's- Barrel: 4697 Bottled: 5-6-19
Pale Golden Straw Color
Nose: Caramel and Coconut combine to give the mild impression of a Caramel Delight Girl Scout Cookie. Some Citrus gives this one a Tropical Vibe. Time in the glencairn yields Oak and Dry Grass along with some Floral Notes. While there is a good amount going on here, everything is light and muted.
Neat: Light and Sweet. The Tropical Vibe continues with Vanilla, Banana, and a surprising amount of Citrus. Light Astringent Oak arrives mid-palate with a little Peppery Spice. Absolutely Zero Kentucky Hug, with Vanilla Sweetness and a little Mint coating the palate.
Splash: A few drops of water brought out a lot of Charred Oak on the nose. Made the palate Spicy and Oaky. Made the Orange Peel way too dominant as well. 
Verdict: I like this one a little less with each pour. Had I rated it from the neck pour it would've been closer to a 4, but after 6 months and a quarter of the bottle down, I just have zero enthusiasm for it. There are some good elements here, but they just don't play well together. It is a Single Barrel Product (so YMMV) but I think that some of the youthful notes that would be smoothed out with a little more time are running the show here."
