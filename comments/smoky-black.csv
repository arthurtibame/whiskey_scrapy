4.25,"My second Famous Grouse, another hit. This is without a doubt the best blended scotch if you measure price vs quality. 

40%abv, tawny.

On the nose, Raisins, Wedding cake, Mint, Bronzer, Cake, Blackberry jam. Very good.

On the palate, it is ashy, peppery but also red fruits that makes this one a special dram.

The aftertaste has a clove note that starts dim but grows over time. 

Overall, this dram is delicious and deserves an 88 over 100. It is cheap so pick this one up."

3.0,"For the price point,  there is value here. Citrus notes on the nose. Salt and some iodine on the pallet with a healthy dose of peat and smoke. Lacking the full mouth feel of better quality spirit's,  but still enough there to warrant a try."
3.0,"For around $25 a bottle, it's not bad. No offense to the other reviewer but I don't find it nearly as bad as he said. I've had FAR worse (looking at you, mcllelands). I typically gravitate towards Islay single malts, the smokier the better. I love ardbeg and lagavulin. This isn't them. It's thinner and less smokey. I'd say MUCH better than JW black, and at half the price. It reminds me of a highland albeit a little less floral. For a cheap alternative though, it's perfectly fine. 
On the nose it's medicinal and citrusy. On the palate it isn't too thin, and I get citrus, black pepper, slight iodine, salt, and towards the end, peat and smoke. 
Overall, I'd give it an 82/100. Not bad, not great, but definitely a good inexpensive option."

1.0,"After tasting the decent 'regular' grouse, I had high expectations for this 'smoky black' blend; Not all bad, but didn't meet my expectations. Ok for it's price, and good as a quick drink, but barely suited as a sipper."

2.0,Has hints of peatiness but overall weak. Excellent budget whiskey for mixing. Last resort to drink neat.

1.0,Ugh. Although I don’t really like the standard Famous Grouse either it is better than this. Way too sweet and smoke is weak.
3.0,"For the money, a good blended whisky. Some fruity on the nose and palate, with the light smoke after. Afordable and enjoyable."

2.0,Not so much.
4.0,Delivered just what I expected - a nice drinkable blended scotch (for a scotch and soda) with a touch of the smoky/peaty flavor I love in a neat dram of single malt Islay but at a much lower price.
2.0,Sweet and Smokey. A little rough and not the best balance

2.0,"Nose:  astringent, sweet, mild spice, very mild peat
Palate:  smooth and thicker than expected, sweet, mild spice, very mild peat
Finish:  short to medium length, mildly spicy and mildly sweet 
A decent budget blended scotch.  The grain whiskey is very obvious.  Not as peaty as I expected from the name."

3.5,"I am not sure why people are so harsh on this scotch. For under $30.00 I thought it was pretty good. Nice smoke and peat balance. Just a little, but not overstated. I think it's a bit similar to JW Black. Some Vanilla and smoothness. Little oak. Could be aged longer, but still enjoyable."

3.25,"Another cheaper alternative to the high end smoky Islay single malts. Great smoke, great price."
2.5,"Get dark fruit like raisins along with toffee and a bit of smoke. A little astringent, but pleasantly so. Not bad at all for the price."

3.25,If your expecting a top shelf experience with this your drinking the wrong whisky. That said this is a solid drinker at its price point. A beautiful scotch to have for your well. Mild smoke sweet for those that mix with soda this is a great choice. For the neat drinkers the knock is the weak non lingering finish. With that said there are not many blended lower cost scotches that stand up but this is one. Dont over expect from it and you will be satisfied with what it delivers. It has a place in my well and it fills it wonderfully.
3.0,Good at the price for what it is

3.0,"A fair amount of smokiness from the nose. Not on the scale of lagavulin 16. More like Highland Park 12 smokiness. Only a hint of maybe honey? Then gets overwhelmed by smoky with a little bit of peaty finish.
Good smoky peaty blend for its price and it's more of an entry level into Islay could be"
2.5,As a lover of smoky scotch I may be at a disadvantage with this one. Im used to powerhouse Islays and the like which blow the doors off this. For me Im searching for the peat and smoke. Where is it? I would say this is mild smoke/peat at best. Mainly tastes like standard Grouse with some ashy char overtones. Its not bad but if I want smoke im not coming here. The grain component is all too present just as the regular release.  If youre looking to tryout peated scotch don't buy this get a single malt such as Ardmore or Spey river or step up to the Ardbeg/ Laphroaig camp and thank me later...........76/100.....too much grain hit for good(80) rating but has enough honey malt to be decent.

2.75,It has a little bit peat notes but it’s very far from the real islay scotch. Very spiritous blended scotch. Good in cocktails.
0.5,Tastes like a cheap bottle of alcohol. I was disappointed. How am I going to get through a litre of this pish? Maybe I'll clean my paint brushes.

3.0,"I really like this blended scotch whisky. There are subtle peat notes and hints of spice that makes this very drinkable. Considering the price in 27-35 depending on your distributor, I would highly recommend grabbing a bottle and enjoying a class for yourself. 

Cheers"

0.75,"Ohh just don't bother, it's not nice if you like smoke/ peaty whisky then just keep walking past this, be better with an ""own brand"" islay malt than this, might be fine with a mixer. 😂"
2.75,"Very salty and sweet. Highly drinkable once, and then it gets to be too much."
2.5,"Not nearly as good as Black Grouse was. Really quite similar to JW Red, but less sweet. When I want a blend, I want it to mix well with club soda, and this doesn’t. Worth buying at $20; not so much at $30."
