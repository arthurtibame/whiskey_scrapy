4.0,"Good, solid bourbon that took some hunting to find, and may not be worth that much effort.  The finish was really hot for me, but overall a very enjoyable drink.  A splash of water or on the rocks really makes this one come alive."
4.0,"Nose - High rye bourbon component dominates here in that I get an herbal, sweet mint, hints of cherry coke syrup, Hawaiian sweet bread.
Taste - First sip hits the tongue with a sweet, herbal mint, almost like a brown sugar mint julep. Subsequent sips get less of this mint and more of a vanilla/cinnamon brown sugar simple sweetness.
Finish - Lingering lightly tannic/oaky warmth with this faint rye-herbal sweet mint. Sadly it's like a splenda-like sweet.
Score - 80/100"

3.0,"Candy corn kernels, sea salt crystals, wheat thin crackers, and a dash of cayenne pepper powder. A good choice off the beaten path."
3.0,"Liked balance overall, sweet and candy tasting but deep nose and good aftertaste. 4 star flavor 3 star cost"
2.0,"Honey, toffee, winter potpourri, and smelling salts on the nose. Palate is smooth and slightly sweet at first, cardboard in the middle, cough medicine at the end. Lingering aftertaste is numbing, spicy, bitter.  Adding an ice cube mellows it out, brings out more caramel, but remains bitter in back of throat. 1/16/17. 
A month later, and my review is exactly the same. 2/17/17"

2.0,"Really wanted to like this one, but I just couldn't. The spice was unpleasant and overpowering. Tried diluting with water and still couldn't get behind it. The rye spice was more overpowering than in most rye's I've had;  and it lacked any of the pleasant qualities I usually love from a rye. Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but it was one of the most unpleasant whiskies I've had in a while."
4.0,Brown sugar & chocolate nose. Nice dried fruit on the palate.  Wish it had a little longer finish.

null,Malt and peppery rye (not minty).
4.0,"Nice, thick sticky legs in the glass.

Nose:  Hint of white chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and an earthiness like wet rocks. A little ethanol. 

Palate:  medium heat with sweetness on the front end, with the earthiness of the nose carrying through. Full mouthfeel. 

Finish:  medium-long and spicy, with some oak barrel influence. When breathing out through the nose, a hint of something subtly vegetal, but cannot place it. 

Good dram. Worthy of four stars."

First sip is heavy with white pepper spice but calms down to reveal some vanilla, citrus and old leather with a subtle oak finish.
A couple drops of water manages the spice well, softens the mouthfeel and adds some tea leaf and brown sugar notes."

3.25,"It seems that the rye is winning the battle for the nose, but is also seems to be a bit sugary, so perhaps this may be as balanced out as they say. For the taste, it seems to be a bit of a sandwich experience for me; rye enters the palate as grain spice, then is flattened and smoothed out by the wheat. This truly does blend together pretty well, but unfortunately, it also seems to cancel parts of each other out in the process. Thankfully for me, the finish almost comes out of nowhere with potent rye spice lingering around for a bit before calming back down."

3.0,"Nose.... Cherries, oats, vanilla, rye, mint and whatever else you might pick up...

Color... A light to medium copper...

Taste... Lightly bodied, subtly flavored.  Faint notes of banana and rye came to the forefront. Followed by soft leather, cocoa, cinnamon and light grass...

Overall... When you take the initial pull you will find yourself underwhelmed, at least I was. I was definitely able to differentiate between the blends which is somewhat off putting, especially considering the other blends on the market. Maybe it was the two year's young they blended, which is more black stallion than whiskey. The nine year blend added the nuance that was leaving and truly picked this whiskey up. After the initial pull, I was about to find rich flavors and a real enjoyment. If they ever blend this with a four year and the nine, they'll have a great product. Solid at the $38.00 I paid but I don't think it has staying power at that price, more like a $28.00 and under range..."
