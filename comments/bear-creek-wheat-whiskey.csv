3.5,"This wheat whiskey is a bright copper nearly orange color with thick very watery legs running down the glass.

The nose is sweet and floral with notes of strawberry Twizzler, honey, dry Smarties candy, and a mild astringency.

The palate is simple but sweet, with notes of caramel apple, honey, and what I’m registering as salami.

The finish is of medium length and tangy."
