3.5,"Now I love cab sav, in fact it's my favorite grape varietal so whilst I was not expecting miracles with this one given the ratings I'd seen and the price range I was very curious to see if what would be an average making effort could be pulled up by it's socks somewhat. Now the casking can't work miracles given the lack of effort which seemingly went into this one but I really do like the flavor profile albeit this does have a detracting sour note on the finish. It gave me a glimpse of what cab sav could do to a great whiskey.. which this isn't. Underlying spirit is rough, casks to worn or been in to short a period but my thoughts were man I'd LOVE to try an appropriately aged Springbank with Cab sav aging. I've had one beautiful and one average Cab Franc from Longrow..anyone tried any good Cab Sav aging?"
