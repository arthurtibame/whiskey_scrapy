4.0,"On the nose, scents of ripe fruit, warm caramel and mashed grapes. On the rocks, dark fruit and spice come through, with spice being more prominent as it warms, mixing with raisin and plum as it lingers."

Taste: pepper, floral, fruit, it's not a straight forward deal but constantly floats around changing and giving variy notes throughout."

4.75,"Had this at a work outing in Chicago because hey, the “standard whistle pig” is amaze-balls, so this has to be better. Didn’t think it was possible, but wow, this version of Whistle Pig tops the previous i had."
5.0,"Nose, palate, finish: all of it is so well balanced and one of my favorite whiskeys. Less spicy than a typical Rye, and incredibly smooth. Reminds me of liquid cotton candy that’s been sitting in an oak barrel."

there things lighten up until very slowly fading into a spicy rye finish. Great balance between heavy rye mash bill and fortified wine barrels."

4.5,"Initial nosing of dill pickle potato chips, opens into more raisinated flavours from the Madeira. Mouth feel is oily and full with sweet fruit blending then into a spice of clove, brown sugar and an aftertaste of botrytis influenced grape. One of the most complex rye whiskies I've ever had"

4.5,"SO much going on here. 
Beautiful legs that stick to the glass...
Nose has light caramel, the familiar whistle pig rye grain notes and hints from the Madeira and port barrels in the background. 
Golden raisins in there somewhere.
Smooth palate carries a lightly sweet grain front to a finish that goes back and forth between dry oakwood, toasted grains, musty barn, cacao, ripe plum, hay, toasted pecans and  brown sugar."
