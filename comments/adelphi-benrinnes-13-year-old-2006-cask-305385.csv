4.75,"Outstanding.  Deep, dark, heavily sherried.  Very rare, but worth the hunt."
5.0,"Fabulous stuff with many sweet and savory tasting notes and a fabulous color. Notes of chocolate, orange, mint, ham, pork, pepper, toffee, and rich malty undertones like a classic sherried Benrinnes or Mortlach."
