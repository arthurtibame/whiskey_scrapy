2.5,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 10:

On the 10th day of Christmas my drinking problem gave to me:

I am completely equal parts excited and apprehensive about this drink. I love whiskey. I love tobasco. That’s how it works, right?

The nose: Okay. This smells awesome. Grown ass man, I literally just giggled. You can kind of get some sugar poking through, but let’s be honest about why we’re here. Straight tobasco. I dig it.

The body: fascinating. The original bourbon comes through here. Maple syrup. Powdered sugar. Deep, sweet orange flavor. Amazing.

The finish: this is really where the tobasco flavor kicks in. The orange fades out with the finish, and you’re suddenly made aware of that tobasco influence. It was in the background on the body, but it buzzes your lips here. Fades out super slowly, lingering on every exhale.

Okay. Holy cow. This drink is amazing. Disclaimer: I literally eat tobasco sauce on every dinner. I currently have 2 bottles in the fridge and 2 more in the pantry. I have an additional 4 bottles in the fridge of miscellaneous varieties. You could say I’m an enthusiast. I’m also likely desensitized to this stuff in lower quantities. This barrel finished doesn’t even make me blink. I haven’t had Dickel in a very long time, but I don’t remember finding all these flavors before. I think the tobasco really does draw some stuff out, or just fritz your taste buds out and make you get some new stuff. I know this drink can’t possibly be for everyone, but if you happen to be a spice fanatic and a bourbon drinker, this one is a no brainer. Amazing.

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 21 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments.

EDIT:

I poured 3 fingers. Everything above was experienced on finger 1. I would rate that finger a 4-star. Finger 2 was a struggle. I was enjoying it less. I would rate it 2.5. I did my best to power through on finger 3. My stomach began to hurt. Maybe 1.5 stars? I don’t know how to rate something like that. Definitely drink this only in small quantities, even if you’ve already accepted tobasco as your personal lord and savior."

3.5,"Nose: definitely get the Tabasco on the front...I’m a lover of all things hot, and this one has some bite...I can see sipping this one with a good Mexican dish...a bit sweet, I was looking for a bit more Dickel...I tried adding an ounce of Evan Williams bib...and it made it much better...too sweet straight...I can see the mind set, Tabasco finished in oak barrels, whiskey finished in oak barrels...it works for me, just too sweet, would like to see higher proof, overall good winter sipper..."
2.25,"Was gifted this bottle.  A novelty for sure.  People reviewing this as a serious whiskey are missing the point.  No, you can't sip this, you'd be an idiot to try.  It's fun, and something really different.  Take it as a shot, after enjoying the smells (probably the best part).  This is what you take as a shot if your college football team is kicking off at 11 and you just got out of bed at 10:30 and need a kick in the ass to wake up.  The 70 proof is frankly disappointing, and they water it down with sugar water to make it extra sweet.  I keep it on hand as a novelty to share sips with visitors, but would never seriously buy it.  The suggestion to try it in a bloody mary might be something I need to try."
1.0,"Ok you bought yourself a bottle of Dickel Tobasco finish, what next?  Well here's a thought.  Chicken Wing Sauce.  Maybe some pork rib rub? 

Truthfully the nose on this is a bit intriguing although I would say the funk of the tobasco pretty much turns it off for me, I could see some folks going for this though.  The taste is another story, the sweet Dickel flavor base with the bold hot spice isn't a winner for me.  This reminds me a bit of the Wild Turkey American Honey with Ghost Pepper.   Not a fan of that either.  Or the even worse Bird Dog Jalapeno Honey that might just be the worst thing I've ever tasted out of a ""whiskey bottle"". 

So spice up those chicken wings on the grill or maybe help out your constipated dog by forcing this down it's throat, either way I can't be accused of being a ""Dickel Homer"" now.   Unless you just love the unexplainable weird flavors, serious NO GO on the red label Dickel."
0.25,"Um, no. Just no. I tried this out of curiosity, and I wish someone would have talked me out of it or at least hit me over the head with something. We need to ask Elon Musk if he will let us use one of his rockets to fire every bit of this abomination into space. I think I need a shower."
3.25,So sweet i was expecting spicier smokier but its super sweet which ruins it for me i want some bite for something labeled tabasco.
1.5,Just awful. Jesus. What were you thinking?

2.5,"Hear me out on this one. I bought this as a joke just to see what one of the lowest rated whiskies was like. It’s one of these things I walk by every time I go to the store and I think, “I should try  this just because it’s so bizarre.”

The nose is bonkers. I get buttercream, caramel, a little oak, and the Tabasco finish. The finish itself isn’t a pungent as you’d expect, and on the palate the whiskey tastes mostly like regular Dickel, which is a pleasant taste. The Tabasco shows up on the finish, tickling the back of your throat just a bit. 

Not all together horrible. For $15 I don’t feel bad about this purchase. It could be a versatile spirit too. I can see myself cooking with this, or maybe making a new, weird Bloody Mary. Try this one for yourself, and if you hate it, you can regift it. Cheers!"
4.0,Surprisingly really good. Just took a taste. So I wonder how an entire glass would be.

2.5,"Definitely a bit strange. The nose has notes of cayenne and caramel, as well as definitely a bit more of an alcohol burn than I expected. Not very spicy on the palate as you sip it, but after swallowing a bit of a Tabasco burn shows up on the tongue. A very sweet finish, almost like some kind of citrus. Overall not too bad for what seems like a gimmick on the surface."
3.25,"Starts off as sweet but not overpowering. Finishes with the tobasco ""burn"" in the throat but not as severe as the actual tobasco. Figured I would give it a try and if I didn't like it I would cook with it. I will cook with it but I'll probably save some to drink as well."

2.5,"Very warm
Sweeter than expected. Better than expected."
3.5,This is actually incredibly good.
3.0,Not as bad as I was expecting.  Much sweeter and the burn is on the back end.  Aroma is better than flavor.  Doesn’t taste like Dickel at all except a brief flash of corn up front.  Probably great in cocktails

2.0,"Nose: Oak, black pepper, chili powder
Taste: Cinnamon red hots, Tabasco"
3.0,"I’m not going to do a classic tasting here because this is not a classic whiskey. I’m not really sure how to rate this. I felt more like I was drinking a cocktail rather than a drink. It is surprisingly sweet and then a nice warm tobacco flavor hits. Not too much, just enough. I actually really liked it but again, don’t count this as a whiskey. Three stars, I guess."

2.0,Off-putting is right. Not a good combo unless it's a shot.

1.0,Do not get confused with the George Dickel name on the bottle as this is not a whiskey.  On the nose it is sweet with a slight chile pepper scent hovering in the background.  It is interesting enough to lure you to take a sip at which time you are overwhelmed with the sweetness.  This is not to be confused with a good honey or sweet corn flavor but instead douses your palate in a pure simple syrup flavor. There is a Tabasco on the back of the palate on the tail end of the finish.  I would only recommend this as a spirit best enjoyed as a shot similar to Fireball without the cinnamon.

0.25,"Nope. A too sweet bourbon, with the vinegar and salt, as well as mild pepper flavor of Tabasco sauce, but not in a good way. This is not pleasant, the only “whiskey” I have ever just poured down the sink."
1.5,"This is pretty gross, fourtanetly I only had a nip and that was enough, the Tabasco added a lot of heat and made it taste much more high proof than it is, but it was so sickeningly, and in my opinion artificially sweet that it kills it for me, take the regular green label and put that in Tabasco and maybe you might have something..."

3.0,Surprisingly sweet but with a heat that lingers.
2.0,The only saving grace here is the tobasco doesn’t linger on your pallet. The spice is gone within seconds of consuming. Very little whiskey flavor. Glad I bought nip bottle instead of a full 750ml

1.0,"I’m really not that smart of a guy.  I wish I was smarter. I wish I took those MCATs.  I wish I thought of the next big dot com craze.  But...I gotta say, I’m at least two standard deviations smarter than the guy or gal that thought of this odd couple finishing.  I tried a shot of this yesterday at a local place, where it was offered next to some celery and salt.  When I’m having whiskey, not sure I have the emotional bandwidth to have celery at the same time.  Celery is great and whiskey is great, but together....not so sure.  LIke texting while having sex.  Both are great, just not recommended together.  Anyway, same goes for Tabasco and whiskey.  I like Tabasco on my scrambled eggs.  I like Tabasco on my baked potato.  I even like a bit on my pasta.  But, not sure it belongs in my whiskey.  Nice experiment, just not willing to pay for it.  The kicker was that while I’m having this, I’m holding a $90 bottle of the new Lahroaig Cairdeas, and the guy is trying to convince me to buy this instead of the Cairdeas, despite the $55 price difference."

4.0,"Very interesting indeed.  You get a nice peppery nose from the glass, which is great as i was expecting pure vinegar smell. The taste has very little actual burn, but you get a nice sweetness at the front which smoothly fades away leaving a spicy note you can sit an enjoy.  This is a great choice to pick up and enjoy with friends."
4.0,"I’ve always been a fan of George Dickle and think it’s one of the best Tennessee whiskeys on the market and well above Jack Daniels, so it’s safe to say I’m a little biased in reviewing this. However, I was skeptical at first glance, but my curiosity got the best of me and I cracked open the bottle to find a secret gem in the world of flavored and unique finished whiskeys. And this is definitely unique. Not a fan of hot sauce but if all hot sauce tasted like this I’d be drinking it through a straw. The best way I can describe the taste is if you watered down Tabasco with a few shots of good ol George Dickle, it does however have a slightly sweet note to it I can’t quite place but it’s very subtle. Absolutely love this whiskey and cannot wait to add more to my personal stock"
3.0,"Odd candy sweetness, with low profile Tabasco pepper spice, which builds, as one sips. Light-to-medium mouth, and a lingering sweet-candy-spice-whiskey finish. Later, at night, I was getting a Tabasco puree burn, in my esophagus. Very strange item, but not terrible. RJT"
