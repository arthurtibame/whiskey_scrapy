Taste: Honey, Vanilla, slight fruit, grain?"
3.0,"A pleasant budget Irish, good for the low price. The bourbon influence is apparent with vanilla up front and an oaky, slightly bitter finish. Seems like some slight vegetal and buscuit notes hiding in there. It is overall light and quite drinkable."

3.0,"The nose is shortbread, but obscured by a heavier-than-expected alcohol fume.

The taste is more of that buttery shortbread, with some apple syrup, dark stone fruits. With a little water added, that apple pie syrup really blooms. The water added brings out the cask tannins that pucker up the middle of the tongue. The texture is slick and buttery to the touch. 

The finish is Cask tannins, apple pie syrup, stone fruits and spicy citrus rind. This Irish is so beautifully easy to drink: so friendly and pleasant. It's not too sweet because the pucker short-circuits any oversweetness that might have tipped it out or balance. A wonderful value."
