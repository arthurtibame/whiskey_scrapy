3.0,"Sharp start, sweetins on the finish"

3.5,Strong dark chocolate and nougat aroma like a (DC) three musketeers. Signature Scotch bite and mild peat but lighter finish from the bourbon barrel finishing. Not bad for the price at all!
3.0,"What hints at wild turkey 101 plus sweet orchard fruit, cereals and malt on the nose, the same notes on the creamy palate and the short finish, although the finish does have a brief bitter note."
3.5,"Beautiful color, very fruity around with some grain. Medium body with light flavor, wood underneath and a bright fruit flavor on top. Quick but pleasant tail. Sweet and mellow."
3.5,"Apple and a bit of cereal on the nose.  Taste reveals lots of apple with a bit of sweetness in the tip of the tongue.  Smooth finish with hints of oak, toffee and more apple.  Overall this play well above its ~$20 USD price point"
