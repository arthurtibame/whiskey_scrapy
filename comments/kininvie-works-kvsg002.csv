3.5,"New shoe smell is still there - rubbery for sure but with something like vanilla backing it up. Toastier towards the back of the nose. Some apples with cinnamon/stewed fruit thing playing against the rubber. Some maltiness, some pastry. 

Rich rye flavour is there on the first sip for sure, winter spice thing that finds its way all over the palate. Bready and seedy again. Not super full-bodied, quite thin and light in that respect but not necessarily in a bad way - the seedy brown bread flavour keeps it interesting. Some caramel there, but it’s a more jagged whisky than a rounded one. Feels young and fresh, savory. 

Tons of brown bread on the finish, lingers for a bit."
3.75,"(First pour) Nose is rubbery and spicey at first. Dried apricots as it opens, maybe those brandy-soaked dates. Salted toffee, some solvent notes too. Cut grass, some rounded citrus. Bit of dog biscuit. Savoury, toasted seed smell becomes more pronounced. 

First taste is more grainy than I expected. Has a hollow mid-palate, but could just be because it’s cleaner than I’m used to. definitely spicy and has toffee, some toasty notes and a bit of that dry rye spice. Plenty of caramel flavour up front, becoming more chocolatey/creamy after a second or two. Some orange zest. 

Feels like there’s some real black pepper that sticks around, but also something seedy like that baltik break from Paris. Toasted seeds for sure on the finish, and some thicker yeasty/breadiness. Date, fennel olive oil combo like that cake. Quite nice and clean/satisfying.

3.75 because it’s unusual."
