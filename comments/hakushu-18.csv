5.0,"The short version of my notes – ""Islay Lite"". The long version... wafting from my careful pour were hints of bandages and smoke. Sipping it yielded sweetness, peat, almost a spiced rum character. Great smooth finish, long and pleasant, well-balanced and well-rounded. Excellent! If you find Islay scotches to be too much, this is probably just right."

5.0,One of my favourites... First tried it at the yamazaki distillery instantly got myself a bottle! Like the 12 years in crispy fruity flavours but extra depth and peat at the end! Hmm... Yum! Expensive thou ...

4.0,Had this again for 600yen at the distillery after 6 years and it's just as good. Milder on the nose and the palate and less peaty than the 12 but outstanding in its finish and elegance

4.25,Burnt caramel and wood - a little harsher on the alcohol than the Yamazaki 18. Tasty.
4.0,"Located at the foothills of the Japanese Alps, Suntory’s second distillery has always stood in the shadow of Yamazaki. Not surprisingly, Hakushu 18 attempts to be a bit like his famous brother. Notes of sherry subdue floral freshness and whiffs of smoke, and the nose unfolds beautifully with unripe papaya, incense and a touch of plum wine. Rich and intense, the taste combines fruity, herbal and spicy flavors with just a hint of peat. Lingering spices, licorice and re-emerging freshness characterize the semidry finish. A worthy silver medal for a fine dram!

RATING: 4.0/5.0 stars ≙ 88 pts → FIRST-CLASS"
4.0,Pears on the nose. Smooth sweet smoky peaty
5.0,"A complete different level from the 12... sweeter and deeper with taste and aroma. I had this side by side with the Hakushu 12 and I neglected the 12 LOL. Made it seem like child’s play.

Nose: as soon as you open and pour, you can smell the sweet beautiful honey dew melon, caramel green apple aroma - fills the room!

Taste: Candied citrus hits your tongue. The melon and green apple continues with less burn than the 12 - not alcohol burn but barrel burn.

Finish: honey coating sticks around in your mouth. Had me smacking my tongue and mouth for a minute. Has a sweet aftertaste of tobacco - kind of like after you smoke a real good cigar but not ash, a honeyed refreshing smoke."

5.0,"Nose- Melon, lychee fruit, mizanura oak, ripe berries, cinnamon, rosemary

Palate- Juicy berries initially, green apples, ginger spice, lime juice, mizunara oak 

Finish- Long, juicy finish of green apples, a nice amount of spice, and a squeeze of lime juice 


Mmm. Fantastic whisky. The nose is excellent, with my highlights being the green apple and melon notes. The palate is sublime, light, floral and spicy. The green apples shine through again, with ginger spice and zesty lime. The finish is also very good- and surprisingly long, which isn’t what ive experienced with other Japanese Whiskies. I think I like this more than Yama 18, and that’s saying something. Absolutely delicious, very complex, and easy to drink."

4.5,"Nose: green apples. More apples second whiff. Maybe a bit of wood coming through underneath

Palate: pears come through like yamazaki 12 year but the smokiness settles in nicely as a two-punch combo. 

Finish: oak with a bit of sweetness. Super super smooth."
