4.0,"I'm a bit amazed that I am the first person to review this lovely whisky from Tomatin! I missed my chance to buy it in Chicago, but sometimes life (and smaller, less cutthroat whiskey markets) give you second chances. I stumbled across a bottle in Madison, for less than $50, and I snatched it up...and I'm glad I did. This is to Tomatin (along with the rest of the Cuatro Series) what Lasanta, Nectar D'Or, and Quinta Ruban are to Glenmorangie. Take the standard house malt, age it in the usual barrels, and then play games with finishing casks. Like Glenmorangie, the light Tomatin base is an excellent canvas for finishes, and the PX profile of sweet richness does well in concert with the base whisky's sweet cereal notes. Tomatin 12 has always made me think of Frosted Flakes; now, we're in Raisin Bran territory as the sweet grain profile is made richer and nuttier by the sherry notes. The palate is creamy and sweet, with raisin, date, and slivered almonds joining the standard Tomatin milk-and-cereal profile. The finish is a bit short, but overall this is one of the better things ever to come out of the distillery."
