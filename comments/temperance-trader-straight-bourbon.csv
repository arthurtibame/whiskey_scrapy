1.0,"Sickly sweet cinnamon on palate and finish. The worst I've had out of 60 bourbons and ryes, and incredibly overpriced to boot! Woodinville (from Washington) is a much better non-traditional bourbon from the Northwest, though it's also too sweet for me (though slightly less so).  Sourced from MGP (and not very transparent about it - hence the class action lawsuit), but seems likely it was aged in Portland, OR, considering it has a sweet profile somewhat similar to Woodinville's."
