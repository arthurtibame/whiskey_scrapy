4.0,"This week I was lucky enough to try a very special whisky, only for sale in the worldwide Duty Free stores, the Ballantine's 23, matured in American White Oak. 

Ballantine's, famous for using whiskies from each of Scotland's regions in their blends, has made a great expression here. 

On the nose: Oranges and that Ballantine vanilla, fondant typical aroma.
Cake, Minerals like salt. Herbal like a fresh field. Slight peat, Toffee and Grapefruit. Pretty nice on the nose.

On the palate, only 3 flavors, a little straightforward. Chocolate, vanilla and pepper. 

Aftertaste is a great reward for this whisky. It is literally a vanilla ice cream, with dulce de leche. Lemons and currants. 

Overall, This blend is especially soft, easy to drink, and although the fruity and sweet is its most notorious profile, it does not cease to have a certain mineral sensation that the small portion of peat has given it. 84 over 100."
