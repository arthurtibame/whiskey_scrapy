3.5,"A very pleasant drink...nothing that will change your world, but it's enjoyable all the way through.

Vanilla, coconut and grass on the nose. That flavor profile carries through on the taste, with a light start, an uptick of vanilla and grass in the middle, and then a kick of pepper at the end. Doesn't stay with you for a long time, but enjoyable throughout. 

This was my first venture into Japanese whiskey, and there's certainly enough here to get me to check out others down the road.

For less than $30, it's a good bottle to have as an everyday drinker."

3.0,"Notes reminiscent of blended Canadian whisky, but not in a bad way.  Simple and easy to drink, without pretending any depth.  All at a price point that shouldn't cause a pause if mixed with a drop of soda or ice for an easy cocktail."

2.75,"It's light floral, sweet, and smooth. Think of a good scotch like Aberfeldy that was doused in a gallon of water."
