3.75,"Sweeter nose than straight, little smoother tongue. Lighter mouthfeel, still a little oily. A little water adds creaminess and a little burn, doesn’t dull the nose (Joseph Magnus bottling)."
4.5,"While not inexpensive, it's still less than $100 if you can find it for retail and not on the secondary market.  More importantly, this pour is nothing short of amazing with its strong caramel, vanilla notes and deceitful ABV, as it's very smooth without a lot of heat...highly recommend drinking neat...enjoy!!"

4.0,"with just a bit more richness to fill out the middle, this would be an absolute top notch bourbon. even as is, it’s a great drink:  good amount of dry oak, great sweetness.  the flavor doesn’t shrink with food either."

4.0,"Release batch 2.  Bottle 586/700

Open for about 7-9 months.  

""This blended bourbon would be about 18 to 20% of a 9 year old light whiskey, with the majority of the blend being 12 year old bourbon, followed by some 19 year old bourbon to give it more depth and complexity. ""  

From Nancy herself on this batch 2 blend.  Of course I'll leave out the notes on the wine finish, well beyond me wheel house to discuss.  

OK so color has that dark old bourbon note.  A touch cloudy perhaps even, very viscous.  

Nose - rich, dusty, I get a lot of cognac notes, and yet there's a white sweet note.  Once opened - huge vanillas, tobacco, oak, leather, and that white sweet note from the finishing.  

Taste - Rich, oaky, dry, yet has a sweet over tone.  Rich sweetness, coating the mouth, it's really good.  

I remember this being better when i first opened it up.  The pineau des charentes casks are really one dimensional at this point.  Sweet, long, lingering but not really adding what I recall.  The bottle is still past the half way point, it seems this bottle doesn't oxidize well.  

That said I'm still giving this 4 stars.  It's really great bourbon but it's missing out on complexity to push it higher and the 160 price is well out of line for most bourbon drinkers."
