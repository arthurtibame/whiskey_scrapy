4.0,"Fresh and citrus on the nose, spices, slight butter, if you let your imagination play. Spicy citrus on the palate, yet a mild and wide base. Butter? Hard to tell. 

Gingerbread through the nose on exhslation after swallowing.
A mix of it all in the aftertaste"
4.5,"So this is my 4th pour of this one.  I'll just say it here because others will ask, yes I got this at an insane deal.  Ohio just gives whisky away if it doesn't sell.  

I'm not well read on what is actually in this bottle, so i'm not sure the driver of the color.  It's actually a really lovely amber but I can't tell if that's from 37 years in oak or if there's more wine finishing.  Legs are well slow forming and long lasting.  

The nose is super citrus at first.  However as it sits I start to get dusty wood notes, the kinds of notes I never get in scotch, but only REALLY old bourbon.  The nose is oily, viscous, rich...  Please note you'll need this one to open up at least 30 minutes but an hour is best.  Still even open it's rich, oily, citrus, there's a touch of white chocolate and even some creme.  

The flavor is complex bringing out that citrus, long lingering vanillas, spices, buttery.

This is outstanding scotch, I can't imagine paying over 1,000 dollars for an whisky, but this is truly special stuff.  I'm scoring it a 4.5 but only given that I think others will be able to find this for under the retail prices.  I'm honestly not even sure how to score something with a price that high."
