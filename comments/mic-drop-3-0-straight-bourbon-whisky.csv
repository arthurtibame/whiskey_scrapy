3.75,"Light and sweet at first and then a big, high rye, high proof burn that hits every corner of your mouth. Definitely lives up to its moniker."

4.25,"Only aged 4 years but I'm digging this, not super complex but sweet with lots of caramel and toffee notes, the way I like."
4.0,"Wasn’t blown away during my first pour, but increasingly enjoy it!"
3.75,"Very sugary, like maple/molasses viscosity sugar. Somewhat strong. Definitely a sipping/special occasion more of thing."
4.5,"Very good every day bourbon. Reminds me of stagg jr. 
Nice complex, it’s a good treat for every day."

2.0,"Not a fan. On the palette, young oak and char too prevalent, mild banana and nuttiness, white pepper, plenty of burn. Maybe a little cherry flavored benadryl taste. $60 for 4 year old MGP? No thanks. Glad this was only a sample. Giant step down from 1.0 and 2.0."

3.5,Sweet with a Lil heat on the backend.
4.25,Delicious. Tropical fruits and bubble gum. On the edge between 4.25 and 4.5.
3.25,"Heavy alcohol on the nose. Palate does have a sweet maple and somewhat fruity taste going for it, but you can also taste the youth. The finish I was not a fan of, not sure what it is, but it’s almost like licorice. Definitely not worth the price, but now that I own it will keep testing to see if I warm up to it. Worst case will make a solid mixer."

3.0,"Smells young, but less so on the palate (although young notes are still there). Intense heat. Cherry syrup lingers. 10/12/19"
4.0,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Nose is hot on approach.  Let it open up for a bit.  Nose gives tons of vanilla and butterscotch.  Fresh grass and pepper on the back.  Vanilla frosting as I spend time with it.  

Creamy texture, powdered sugar on the tongue.  Gives way to more vanilla, hint of mint, hint of bubble gum.  Slight slight hint of spice.  Then decent legs of vanilla and that bubble gum.  Pepper really gives a good burn the more I drink it.  A few sips in gave me an intense Kentucky hug.

It very enjoyable but the age definitely holds it back from being a special MGP.  I prefer my Backbone Store Pick (4.5 years) over this."
4.0,Nice amount of char. Caramel and Vanilla. Classic. Delicious

3.25,"Tonight's Whiskey of the day is none other than the third release in the Mic Drop series. This time rather then releasing an old age stated super limited batch, they have gone with a more accessible 4 yr old Bourbon from MGP (using the 36% rye Mashbill). It's unfiltered and cask strength coming in at 112.2 proof. Let's see if it lives up to the considerable hype of the previous releases...

On the palette it's pretty hot with a medium viscosity. As it enters you are hit with a big dose of pepper and rye spice that gives way to some fruit notes (cinnamon apples). Some candy corn on the mid palette with a barrel spice driven finish. All that spice makes it feel hotter on the palette than you would expect for the proof. It reminds me of a more brash and spicier Belle Meade Reserve (7 yr old MGP Bourbon at Cask Strength). 

All in all it's a so so release that is far off the previous releases. If you are a fan of spicy and peppery Bourbon, this might be up your alley! 

Cheers All"

4.25,"Nose- sweet fruit, bubblegum and spice
Palette- more berry & stone fruit along with bubblegum and a noticeable Rye spice
Finish- lingers nicely and wraps it all up."
4.0,"I enjoyed this. Very unique. Spicy rye and bubblegum, sweet, approachable. A bit of ethanol on the finish."

4.25,"Nose. Very much a fruit sweetness with a nice toasted oak
Palate. Good mouth feel, palate follows the nose with sweet fruity flavors. Mainly citrus and some sour apple with hints of baking spice.
Finish. The mellow oakiness reappears and enhanced baking spice."
