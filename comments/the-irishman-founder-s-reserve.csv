3.0,"Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/2014 : Similar to the 12 year old :  Again, sweetness of banana on the nose.  A creamier, richer palate that is rounder and tamer than the 12 year old."

2.0,Far too sweet. It is a smooth drinking whiskey and could be easily pleasing to those with a sweet tooth. Needs more barrel influence.

null,"A few years ago, they sold a variety called Original Clan.  Same mix of pot still and malt.  But, I've had both, and the older is somewhat better.  So, I bought a couple of cases.  This is my go to Irish - as good as my Redbreast at half the price!"

3.0,"Nose: Green Apple

Taste: light fruit, apple, hint of honey"
3.75,"Smooth, easy drink.  Nothing spectacular, but solid nonetheless.  
Nose is hay, musty barn,  some lighter fruits and spices.
Front is sweet and smooth, followed by some cereal grain on the palate and a warm finish.  Light caramel and toast with hints of sugar cookies and toasted pecan."

4.0,"Definitely get the green apple from nose to palette. Has some other fruity notes to it as well. Creamy up front (Irish whiskey) then definitely has more of the sour apple in the back and finishes well. Other notes, woody, oak. Vanilla, shortbread. Certainly a difference from the regular Irishman original, but not bad from this product line."

3.0,"Not bad, but missing some flavors. Mostly getting oak."
3.75,"We see a handful of reviews that compare to brands like Redbreast, Green Spot and Writers Tears. Top shelf shit! The Irishman, distilled at Walsh Distillery, the same as Writers Tears.. has a heavy single malt and pot still blend.. it is fantastic! It could very well be a bench mark for Irish whiskey, especially with such strong POT STILL flavor. Single Malt texture with bursting pear, green apple nose + taste with smooth honey finish. It's obvious why some toss around Redbreast, Green Spot and Writers Tears comparisons, it is really THAT good! If one where looking to explore Irish whiskey, I'd start here knowing this is really good stuff."

3.5,"Nose: strong vanilla sweetness, some fruits, mainly red apple. Buiscuity notes, but much less than in Writer's tears. No smoke, no spices, very smooth and pleasant. 
Palate: first sip is over-spiced and pungent for me. Following sips are more friendly warming spices. Some sweetness. I cannot feel any fruity notes unfortunately.
Finish: some bitterness, nutty notes.
With some water: less fruitiness on nose, less pungency on palate, less bitterness on finish."
3.5,"I think this stuff is very underrated. Blend with single malt and pot still is not the norm. Writers tears has this as well albeit higher pot still. I snagged this on sale with two glasses for $19.99 . Nose has some complexity with honey, green tea and fresh sunflower. Good legs and nice mouthfeel, flavor is rich with great body and balance(almost scotch like) tasty malt with pot still spice. Finishes smooth, long, savory drying out to oak. A real gem imo kinda like a young budget Redbreast. Think I have to stick to pure pot still , single malts or these type of blends as regular grain blends are not in same ballpark for me. I already returned to get another one of these for backup 86/100

Update : see this now for around $32.....think im gonna try Writers tears"

3.25,"Apples, honey and cereal grain on the nose, there's is also a faint note I can only compare to model airplane glue which is strangely enticing, smooth and creamy on the palate with malt, apples and honey, the finish is medium length with a little nutty, peppery spice."
4.75,Heavy biscuit and butter. No real fruit but very rounded and easy to sip
3.5,"I think of this as a ""dessert whiskey"" as it on the sweet side."

3.75,"After reading the reviews here I wanted to try this. Unfortunately for me the lowest price I could find it for in my area was $37 before tax. It is a good whisky, a little hot, but with great flavor of honey, malt, vanilla, spice and and a hint of sweetness--which I think is typical of Irish whisky. It has a great mouthfeel, much heavier than a typical Irish. I admit that Irish is not my go to whisky. When I survey my purchases and empty bottles, they seem to be in a ratio of Scotch 20, bourbon 3, rye 2, and Irish 1. I like this Irish, it is really good. However, since I seldom drink Irish and this is very pricey in my area, I will probably stick with the more available Bushmills, Jameson, and definitely the wonderful Black Bush, all at a lower price. If this could be had for around $25 around here, it would be a regular purchase"

3.25,Lacks that straight up smoothness you’d expect with an Irish whiskey but still has a pleasant sweet fruity smoothness on the back. A nice oaky maybe flowery spice up front? Semi complex but almost missing something

2.75,"The Irishman Founder’s Reserve is a NAS blend of Single Malt (70%) and Pot Still (30%) whiskeys from Walsh Whiskey that is triple distilled and matured in Bourbon casks. Their Royal Oak distillery in County Carlow opened in 2016 and produces The Writers’ Tears range also. I took an interesting tour of the distillery last year - I was in a tour group of one, so I got some undivided attention from the knowledgeable guide. With their own means of production they plan to extend their range under both brands, and they hope to soon release the first whiskey distilled at their new facility. In the meantime this is produced to Walsh's recipe by Midleton distillery.

This smells better than it tastes. The nose is light and fruity, with cereal and vanilla but a tad too much ethanol. The palate is lightly sweet, malt and honey - pleasant but far from remarkable. A few drops of water mutes the ethanol but I found that it is easily drowned. Calibrate carefully!

In my opinion, it’s not as good as The Irishman 12 Year Single Malt, which is also aged in ex-bourbon casks, but better than the The Irishman Single Malt NAS that is aged in a mixture of ex-bourbon and ex-Oloroso sherry casks. But hey, my personal preferences tend to slightly lean away from the sweeter “winey’ finishes"

3.25,"Vanilla and wood nose, with a bit of tartness. 

Smooth palate, with hints of honey and a short finish."
