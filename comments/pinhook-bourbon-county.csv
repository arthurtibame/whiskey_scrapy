3.0,"It’s only aged 3 years,  and it shows.  Very fruity throughout with hints of peach and persimmon. Could almost be mistaken as a peach brandy,  strangely enough.  Not bad,  but is overpriced by about 10-15$ in my opinion."

3.25,"Little mild, but easy drinking. Buttery carmel and warm biscuits. Half oz taste from a sample bottle. Will definitely revisit."
4.5,"Toffee,caramel,vanilla sweet with some spice on the back end. Medium lingering finish I enjoy it best neat.  Very smooth and well balanced. Wonderful whisky happy to have it in my collection."

4.0,"I LOVE the finish on this. Peach is definitely the theme but the finish brings me back to little league baseball and chewing Bazooka Joe bubblegum. The nose definitely is sweet, fresh peachy fruit and light vanilla.  The youth does show as its apparently aged 3yrs, so you taste the corn. Spice definitely kicks in the palate and again it shows it’s relatively young age.  But the finish is so unique. It lingers forever!!  You get the sweet peach, peppery heat, and some light new oak.  But it costs your mouth so well that you lick your lips and have some bubblegum taste.  One of a kind here for a 3yr old bourbon!  8.2/10!"

3.5,I really enjoyed this. Introduced to me today. Smooth taste. Salty caramel smell. Leather and oak flavor. Very smooth for the price.

3.5,Can definitely tell it’s a young bourbon.  Lacks some depth but decent for a $40bottle

4.0,I like a good sprite and bourbon!! This is one of my favorite to mix. It’s sweet and light with fruity hints but don’t count out the spiciness that comes through.

3.25,"Thin nose, some fruit. Velvety on the tongue. Some young notes, a hint of butter. Some floral notes, but not off putting. It somehow comes together. 1/5/19"

3.25,"Sweet fruity nose followed by some spice. The finish is what was most interesting, fruit and candy that lingered. Decent pour neat for the price, but my wife enjoyed it very much in an old fashioned."
