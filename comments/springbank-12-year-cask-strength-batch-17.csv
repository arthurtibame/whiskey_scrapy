5.0,"The best parts of every scotch region all in one glorious combo. High end of light peat smoke (more meaty than smoky), earthy/dirty and salty with a nice maritime minerality. Sherry is pleasantly balanced with the peat and earth, bringing forth a delicious dried red fruit characteristic; all wrapped in a layer of savory fragrance of florality, fruit, and caramel. Drink neat or with a few drops of water!"

4.0,"Steep, needs a bit of water to reveal more character. I got somewhat hints of salt and eucalyptus on the smell, I taste spices on the palate, slight caramel but the finish is not as burning as expected. Definitely water + a bit of resting before sipping"

4.25,"N: Quite gentle for a cask strength whisky. Not as much burn as expected. You can smell a mix of vanilla from the bourbon casks but it the sherry casks hold the most influence on the nose. It’s warm and smells like soaked dried fruit ready for putting in a Christmas cake.
T: like the nose suggested Sherry, lots of it! It’s a juicy whisky full of raisins the cask strength gives it spice on the palate and lips. Like cloves and cinnamon with a touch of chilli pepper heat. There is a touch of vanilla and finally that Springbank saline finishing note.
F: A long finish with a little bit of peat. The heat and spice goes on and on."

5.0,"Damn. Worth the hype. Damn all the accusations of fan bait, this dram delivers peat and sherry in a strong balance that donwplays neither. Truly excellent."
4.0,"medicinal, peaty, strong

5.0,Strong but great balance with a hint of earthiness in the middle
4.0,"Very smooth given the ABV; buttery, chocolate with just the faintest peat to dry it out a bit. Rich, oily, great stuff if you can find it."
3.75,"Fresh, spirit driven and medicinal. Cough syrup in nose and grassy notes. Green and fresh. Slight peat, perhaps?
Oily and thick, fresh grass, liquorice and fennel in mouth, minty and slightly peppery.
Medium finish again with the cough syrup coming back"
