3.0,I was falling back in love with Ledaig but this one again has me thinking...eh maybe not. A work colleague I was drinking with preferred it over the 10 year Ledaig because he liked the rough rawness. Me not so much. Definitely got the finish coming through but quite bitter sharp and jagged. 3.25
