4.0,Very smooth - not too much heat
4.0,"Nose - Bit sharp on the nose, spicy rye, hint of vanilla, caramel, light cherry cough drops, cinnamon, light herbal/spice, hint of maple syrup.

Taste - Light herbal sweet mint, cinnamon toffee, maraschino cherries mixed with fresh bing cherries, caramel, hint of pine, maple syrup, light drying/tannic.

Finish - Lingering cinnamon spice, maple toffee, cherry cough drops, cinnamon red hots, sharp sweet

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - So this was the first release featuring some of High West's own distillate and so far I'm not sure if I'm a huge fan. This year's release doesn't seem to have the same depth as previous years and it's a bit sharp on the sweetness and not as refined as previous releases. I don't get that nice stewed dark stone fruits as I typically get and this has more of a sharp singular sweet. The maple touch is nice, but it doesn't seem to really blend together very well.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Already did, not sure I'd want too many more"

2.5,"Pretty unimpressed with Act 6 Scene 5, but have heard amazing things of the previous acts. Immediately, the nose was unpleasantly dill and alcohol. As expected with a fairly high proof. Opens up to allow cinnamon toast to take over with some warm plum, but the dill remains. Burn and wood assault the palate like a young whisky might, but the calm down and allow pleasant rye and barrel characteristics. I found red fruit, speaking to the port finish, with warming spices and rye, but plenty of alcohol burn and airiness with a maple syrup sweetness throughout. The aftertaste bites at first with more alcohol, but warms with spiced pear and oak, unfortunately the dill note returns, overshadows, and feels discordant with what could otherwise be a very pleasant dram.

Aroma: Cinnamon toast, dill, & plum.
Flavor: Red fruits, alcohol, oak, cinnamon spices, & maple syrup.
Aftertaste: Spiced pear, dill, & oak.
Body: Medium-heavy, thinning as it opens up."

3.0,"I’ve come to the conclusion that High West Distillery and the rock band Weezer walk the same cosmic line:  fans either love what they were or what they’ve become.

High West was the darling, craft distillery that gave us A Midwinter Night’s Dram Acts 1-3 and Weezer was a nerdy, alt-rock band that gave us Buddy Holly.  Later they gave us (conglomerate) Midwinter Night’s Dram Acts 4-6 and Pork ‘n Beans, respectively.  What. The. Everloving. Fuuuuuu-dge.

I’ve had the privilege to try 4 ever-evolving batches of AMWND:  2:1, 4:1, 4:4 and now 6:4 (thanks @Scott_E).  Needless to say, the quality has seemingly dropped each time.  It’s like they took a Christmas spiced, Yankee candle and shredded it into some young, rye whiskey.

The balances and experimentation from early releases, wine cask experimentation to pushing rye levels, has turned into more of a one-trick pony of youthful rye whiskey and tired barrels.  Sigh.

I miss the days when whiskey wasn’t so damn popular.  Quality is suffering, prices are crazy and I’ve gotten older.  Here’s to sticking with older, age statement Scotch whisky.  

Hipsters, excuse my French, but I hope you choke on your next Pickleback.  Now, GET OFF MY LAWN, PUNKS.  I need a shot of penicillin and a boilermaker.  

🤣"
3.5,"I’ve been a huge fan of High West.  Visited their distillery.  Did the tour.  Paid for the overpriced 14 yr Distillery only whiskey.  But it was my first taste of their act 2 and 3 that made me fall in love.  I recall those early acts were like orange infused spice markets, filled with scents like mulled wine.  More on the oranges, cloves, and dark fruits with the right balance from the wine.  But I also felt that their more recent offerings of Midwinter simply didn’t stand up the amazing Act 2 and 3, but almost doubled in price.  I held off buying Act 6, even though it’s now made partially with their own juice.  Thanks to my buddy @Scott_E, who sent me a generous pour , I got to sample it.  

I’m afraid the more recent Acts do not live up to the original early versions.  There’s now somewhat an imbalance of the wine cask.  Less oranges and cloves, those winter spices, and more of the red wine.  Slightly tannic, much more cinnamon-y hotter.  

Personally I’d still rank their Act 2 and 3 as my favorites ( possibly top 10).  This is pretty good,  but at the current prices of $140+, hard pass.  Instead if I want a midwinter-y rye, I’ll go for the $40 offering from Splinter Group.  
Thanks for this @Scott_E —thanks to you, I’ve now have had every Act of Midwinter (except their inaugural Act 1)."

3.25,"Act 6/Scene 4

I have been out of commission for the past few weeks.  Ready to  do some samplin’.  I been out purchasing A Midwinters Nights Dram since Act 2.  I was instantly hooked.  Act 3 was almost as as good as Act 2.  Each year, though, has seen diminishing returns (though I haven’t yet tasted Act 5; still unopened).  Act 6 finds High West working their home brewed, non-sourced rye into the fray.  Each fall I get eager for the this rye seeking for the days of yore. 

The distinctive baking spice qualities are present: nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, allspice.  There is a subtle fruity raspberry jam sweetness that hovers just above the spices.  Vanilla, dill and pine needles surface after some time.  It transported me to a pine forest on a crisp cool afternoon.   Nice nose. 

What arrive on the palate is not what I’m is on the nose.  Medium weight and velvety body delivers wood spice, black pepper and spearmint.  Faint notes of cola come through as it works towards a finish. 

The cola carries forward along with a minty, resinous, drying pine wood.  Some remnants of apple skins, black licorice and bitter dark chocolate carry the finish to a long lasting close. 

A healthy dose of water soften the spice and accentuates the sweetness, though the dram. 

As it compares to the early generations, Act 6 is a shadow of its former self. The balance is off and I sense that weaker casks were used during maturation or younger, rushed spirit was produced; almost as if the former recipe is trying to be rediscovered.  A recently sampled Sagamore Rye Port Finish At half the cost provides a better, more balanced experience.  Would I consider Act 7 at $125? Probably not, but still may be lored into wishful tasting seeking what once was.  [86/100][$125][Tasted: 10/11/19]"

4.5,"Boy do I like this!  Seriously excellent stuff.  This is Act 6 Scene 6 and I'm lead to believe that, starting with Act 6, this has some of High West's own distillate blended in where previous iterations were all sourced.

Nose:  Vanilla, corn flakes, baking spices, dried fruits like cherries and figs, toasted almonds, brown sugar, poached apples.  This just keeps getting more complex as I sniff.

Flavor:  Honestly...like fruit cake but not shitty.  Dark caramelized sugar, some cereal notes, more dark dried fruits, a little port barrel funk, lots of baking spices from the European oak, and a hint of banana.

Finish:  Long.  Much longer than I expected and it changes as it goes.  Mixed baking spices with some rye spice, a little bit of mint, black pepper, and more fortified wine funk.

This stuff is seriously delicious!  Get it."

Perfect smooth mouth feel.  Might be the most flavor up front on a rye I have had.  Berries and cream take over the tongue and intensify.  That rye spice that dominates the nose does not dominate the taste.  

This competes with Willet 4 Year for my favorite rye.  Wowzers."

MWND Act 7 Scene 2

NOSE: The nose on High West seldom disappoints and this one is no exception. Complex and Evolving the longer it sits. Definitely Rye! I get a savory Umami Note that for me is a characteristic of several HW Ryes. Dried Herbs and Spices like Black Pepper, Cinnamon, Clove, Dill and Mustard Seed. You also have some Dried Dark Fruits in the background. Think Raisins or Prunes. After a while, the Dill begins to dominate. A nose of the empty glass yield Floral and Oak notes that transition to a Humidor full of Cigars. Very good!

NEAT: Dry Spicy Oak dominates. Dry Red Wine, Dried Fruit,  with just a touch of Vanilla. I get Sweet Tea down the center of the tongue with Black Pepper down the sides. Nice warming Medium Length Finish. The palate is coated with the Spicy Oak, Fresh Mint and Port Wine. This fades to a Grassy, Earthy note. The Mouthfeel is Silky and Tingly.

SPLASH: The palate on MWND seems almost angry or aggressive, but a little water has a calming effect. To the nose it adds Orange Peel and Caramelized Sugars. Burnt Pie Crust? Transforms the nose more to the sweet side. It really helps some of the conflicting notes on the palate play a little more nicely together. Reduces the Black Pepper and helps bring the Vanilla to the forefront. The Wood is a little less dominant as well. Takes on a Sweet-ish Wine-y quality. The coating of the palate is a little sweeter and the nice Grassy Note on the finish arrives sooner and is more pronounced. Cherries also make a late appearance. The more I drink of this, the more I like it. 

VERDICT: While this is not something I sought to purchase, I'm glad I lucked into it and purchased it on impulse. I was struggling with this until I gave it a little water. There are probably not very many spirits I've reviewed that have more notes under ""splash"" than ""neat"". An interesting whiskey and I could see myself buying it again, even with the $100 price tag. Well done HW!"

2.0,"This bottle (Act 6, Scene 4) came highly recommended, but I’m now halfway through it and it just isn’t working for me.

I’m getting a grape juice and pickle juice finish that is killing the enjoyment of the rye spice. To be fair, I generally don’t like finished whiskies...Barrell Dovetail being the rare exception."
4.25,null
4.25,"Act 6 Scene 5.  Bottle has been open for 10 months or so now, about at the halfway mark so I thought I’d finally jot some tasting notes.

A deeply red, attractive bronze. Slightly viscous, but not too oily.  Bubblegum nose, some dry white grape and pear.  Simultaneously rich and crisply mineral.  A brief snap of ethanol spice concludes each (and every) nosing.  Doesn’t singe or force you away, just makes its presence known.

Opens the palate mouth-fillingly sweet, then buttery, then the bubblegum and grape must assert themselves.  Tingles build gently on the sides of the tongue and cheeks, then flash through the back of the mouth on the finish.  Fresh chilis and lemon Starburst linger on.  Some bitter chocolate.  Nutmeg.  Orange rind.  Definitely herbal notes - both floral marjoram and peppery basil come to mind. 

I really, really like this, even though some parts feel a smidge disjointed.  Shares some kinship with Willet rye.  The barrel finishing is well-executed and complimentary.

Quite complex and hard to decipher everything thats going on. I think the core notes have been consistent throughout the bottle, but otherwise my perceptions have varied widely each time.  I honestly wasn’t much of a fan for the first tasting or two.  I have grown to enjoy this quite a bit, although I missed the much venerated first few acts and thus don’t know how much better it could be.  Thankfully respectable opinions indicate that act 7 may yet be an upgrade, so I’m thankful I have an a7s5 bottle in hand."
