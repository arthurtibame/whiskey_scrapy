3.75,"Thanks @LeeEvolved for adding this entry. I nabbed a sample of this from MoM. Candy Floss, Brown sugar, creme brulee nose, honey suckle and caramel on the nose. On the palate the dark rum, spice comes through as well as well as aforementioned flavors. Aftertaste lets it down a bit with slight gluee bitterness but its still warming. 4 I was thinking for this one but as some drams get better and better others flaws really become more prominent and overpowering....so 3.75 max. it's not a cheap drop either at $200 USD. Don't worry Lee I often find the same off putting bitterness aspect with Macallans which drags most from a higher rating down into 3.75 territory not a problem for most people and yourself so I'm sure you'll enjoy the bottle more than me :-)"
