4.0,Incredibly strong vanilla and sweet up front. A little burn but still sweet all the way to the lingering finish

5.0,A friend brought some to a cookout for me to try.  On the nose I got macerated fruits and vanilla.  This stuff is smoooooth and sweet.  Loved it!
4.0,Found a bottle of this when visiting Pinehurst NC recently and found out they only sell this around high end golf resorts?   Anyway very good dram and for a 10 year single barrel product great value at $49
