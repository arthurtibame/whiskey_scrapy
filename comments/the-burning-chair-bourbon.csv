4.0,"Easy drinking, quiet finish."
2.0,"A good first expression that would have benefited from more time in the charred oak.  There is a subtle sweetness to the nose: cherry, grilled green apple. This is followed by muted flavors to taste. There is are some interesting flavors just below the surface that never fully develop to their potential: candied apricots, brown sugar, and apple. The finish is fast and disappointing, like losing money at roulette. I feel like the extra aging on the wine barrels was meant to give a mellowness to the bourbon but has instead dulled it a bit too much for my taste. On the bright side I t does have a cool bottle."

3.5,"The name scared me.

I stopped by my usual liquor store to pick up a bottle to enjoy for the next week or so. Unfortunately, they appeared to have stopped carrying my favorite. Alas, I stood there for an embarrassingly long time reading the same labels over and over, looking for something new that stood out to me while using the Microsoft Word document that is my brain to find any mention of an interesting bourbon to try. Bear in mind that Microsoft Word is, by no means, an overtly intelligent program...

I found Burning Chair, and was immediately both interested and anxious as to why a distillery would actively add the implication of fire to their brand, especially considering something would need to go terribly wrong for my chair to burn. That said, it turns out to be a very smooth bourbon- very nice for sipping. More subtle than what I usually like, but spicy with an oddly (and enjoyably) bitter cling in the mouth. The nose was about what you'd expect from a decent bourbon with sweet, subdued scents, but overall it did nicely in a pinch and I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again.

Tasted neat.

I'm pleased to report that the burn experienced was well within acceptable ranges. My chair remains in excellent order."

3.75,Nothing special at first but as I got to the end of my glass the subtle fruity sweetness started to come out more and more. I think I would like this as a dessert bourbon with a  piece of nice light milk chocolate cake

4.25,"Too early to tell.  Has an odd  smell I can’t place.  Not sure it’s worth the price I paid, but I should try it again to see if the chocolate I ate before tasting the bourbon had an impact.

Tried again. Raised my original rating to 4 stars.  I’m liking it better and better"

3.75,Smooth and rather sweet.  Surprisingly good!
4.25,"I just don't know what to say about this... Nose is very complex... Taste is  so smooth, so many flavor notes and I expect the late sweetness of Angel's Envy that is not there... That final note is...Cab + Chocolate + ???  If I want a bourbon to sip on and just think about the bourbon... This is it.  Not enough words... May upgrade my rating in the future."
3.5,Not much at first. Strong burn. Sweetness came out after a few sips. Tastes of vanilla.

4.5,"sweet cherry, silky butterscotch, and slight cedar nose.  The mid palate is jammy with black berries and candied cherries.   A monster finish, just massive.  Rum soaked fruit cake, a bakers spice cabinet stored inside a cigar box.  Grippy caramel and oak hold on for a long finish where fudge and white chocolate linger just under the surface."

4.0,The nose of it is a bit spicy with Barrel tannins from the wine then the taste is sweet and mellow with a little bit of a dry quality to it like biting into a nice sweet mellow candy
