5.0,george t stagg year to year is consistently one of my favorite bourbons.   it has a ridiculous finish that continues to hang and develop.   if a better bourbon happens to exist..  i want it!!!!
5.0,"I feel unqualified to review this bourbon since my palate is still developing, but here we go...

Nose is subtle and warm, very inviting and oak dominant. Caramel sweetness lingers.

Palate starts with intense caramel which fades to dry tobacco and bitter spice. Marshmallow and oak follow up with an electric mouth feel which is a bit odd. Rye and bubble gum sweetness are on the finish.

This is a wild ride of a bourbon, and worth over paying a tiny bit to taste once a year."

4.5,"Neat. Opened for over 6 months.  My Father’s Day hitter pour.  Honestly, the nose is challenging me to draw anything.  Must be me.  Some buttery, slightly burnt graham cracker crust with some custard.  Black pepper with a bit of bite.  Caramel drizzle.  Hint of raspberries.  

Mouth feel is syrupy, syrupy where you can even feel the grit to it.  Initially it is very dark, brown sugar and maple with a bit of sourness from those raspberries.  Taste hits me with that custard, proceeded by the buttery graham cracker crust.  Legs are caramel, hint of oak and the black pepper.  Oak lingers quite a bit.

Nose is really coming alive now that I have been sitting with it.  Could have been my palate and the first pour of the day.  These great fruit notes are emerging.  Cherries, blueberries.  Starting to paint a more complete picture of a fruit tart really.  Getting some darker notes of coffee and leather now too.

It’s such a beautiful pour.  Less in my face than I remembered.  It’s just so well balanced.  Sweet but not too sweet.  Not over oaked.  Slight bitter and sour, but it compliments.  At the same time, it doesn’t stand out to me like it once did.  No characteristic really stands out to put it over the top though.  I simultaneously enjoyed it while being slightly disappointed."
5.0,"First time trying this bottle 

Nose - vanilla explosion! Super complex nose with a lot going on. Nutmeg and spices round out an excellent nose with some cherries and sugar. For a 124 proof bourbon I didn’t catch hardly any ethanol burn.

Taste - very full and rich to the tongue. Vanilla leads the way with other spices. Amazingly smooth. Vanilla keeps rolling on my tongue and leads way to a cherry flavor and light pepper taste. Vanilla stays on the tongue with light burn on a long finish. This is how bourbon should taste.

Overall and value- I am so glad this bottle lived up to the hype. Vanilla lovers should be on the lookout for this 2018 release. I hate that a bottle this good is so hard to find or so expensive. This bottle is easily in my top 3."
4.5,"Got lucky to get this pretty cheap per pour at a restaurant. Caramel, apple, cherry, same nose I get with a lot of the BT products. What sets this apart is the mouthfeel and palate. 

Mouthfeel for days. So round and rich and complex. I have a bottle of Stagg Jr. batch 13 at home and they’re very similar. Hot and round. Apple and cherry and caramel. Similar to Weller and Eagle Rare just turned up to the max. 

Worth $25 a pour? Yes. Worth $600? No. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

4.25,"What a great nose, rich caramel. Bread, spice, oak, brown sugar, cinnamon and other baking spices. Incredible. On the palate, surprisingly smooth for Stagg. Nice heat, lingers. An unexpected perfumy note. Sweet. Leather. Pecan nibs. Maybe a citrus note at the end? Not as intense as the 2017 batch. 11/30/18"

5.0,"I noticed this bottle yesterday when I bought a pour of the Sazerac 18 and couldn't bring myself to pay for 2 $25 pours on the same day! Given I had the 2017 edition of the Stagg ( and loved it) I opted for the Sazerac! However, today is a new day and as a reward for a fantastic workout I am back to sample this beauty (yes @PBMichiganWolverine I realize my excuses are running thin!!). 
Clocking in at 124.9% proof this is the lowest proof Stagg to date. I am hoping this only makes pulling tasting notes easier! On to the tasting!
Right upon entry you get a burst of cherries, raisins, burnt brown sugar layered over some subtle rye spice. You then get some toasted oak and vanilla notes. This then leads to a long cane sugar, toffee and tobacco finish. The entire way you barely sense the heat. Very easy sipper that's ridiculously oily. As I sit and contemplate the sip, the finish just keeps going and I get some more oak notes. The most impressive part of this dram is just how darn complex it is.  Hard 5 star dram and I would say it slightly pips the Sazerac 18. However, both are just exceptional. They do have a Thomas H Handy as well, I see that in my future this week! Cheers all!"

4.5,"Nose - (w/o water) Intense dark caramel/toffee, sweet cherry coke syrup, tannic leather, cinnamon, dark roast coffee (w/ water) Lightens the nose a bit, more oaky vanilla dark caramels, dark chocolate, chocolate covered cherries.

Taste - (w/o water) Hot, spicy cinnamon, sweet cherries, dark toffee, dark chocolate, hint of dark espresso sweet, coke syrup (w/ water) Greatly tamed heat on entry, delayed cinnamon spice, light oaky/tannic vanilla toffee appears, oaky cherry coke syrup, dark mocha latte sweet.

Finish - (w/o water) Long lasting cinnamon heat, lingering light tannic sweetness, light oaky cherry coke syrup, cocoa nibs (w/ water) More pronounced cinnamon heat, oddly enough, more of a sharper cherry sweetness, dark toffee, coke syrup, bitter dark chocolate.

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - This was a tasty bourbon for sure and had lots of notes I love in a higher proof bourbon of the cherry coke syrup and subtle leather notes I get with older bourbons. It was good, but didn't really have much of a ""wow"" factor other than it did feel a bit hot even for the high proof. Nothing really off putting in this one, and it definitely took a few drops of water very well and I think would be the ideal way to enjoy this pour as it's quite hot otherwise.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, at MSRP or close to it"

Finish: Caramel, dark fruit, and oak last forever. One hell of a sip."

3.5,more mellow than the stagg jr.  classic in its style but still not my absolute favorite style
5.0,This is my first time trying GTS.  Neat in a glencairn glass with Christmas dinner.  It smelled great without a harsh alcohol burn.  It tasted sweet and I had a hard time believing it was 125 proof.  Coated the mouth well and lasted.  Probably the best bourbon I’ve had.
4.75,so much flavor. hard to beat!

4.75,"Great bourbon. This is strong but tasty stuff. Even the nose is hot be careful how far you stick your face in. Speaking of nose it’s brown/burnt sugar with vanilla and oak and hints of spice and dried fruit. The taste comes on strong but complex with wood and tannins followed by the burnt sugar, vanilla and baking spices. The finish is long and still a little hot and slightly astringent but very pleasant. The burnt sugar is prevalent with hints of spice oak and orange peel."
5.0,"Share. Nose is complex: Sweet caramel notes, powerful oak cake, bits of mint and dark fruit. 

The taste is incredible. Overwhelming (in a great way) amounts of caramel, vanilla, oak with some prolonged heat at the finish. This is easily the best bourbon I've ever had."

4.5,"Brownish-copper color.
Rum-soaked cherries, brown sugar, wine-soaked cork, vanilla, citrus, you name it...It’s all in there on the nose.
The mouthfeel is soft and full with plenty of dark fruits, citrus and musty wood for a flavor profile. Further tastes become oilier and exhibit more citrus on the backend.
Definitely play with adding a couple drops of water. The flavor profile blossoms and becomes even more fruit-forward."
4.0,"Really, really intriguing but maybe not QUITE on par with 2017.

Nose: big and sweet with raspberry jam, peanuts and pecans, molasses, balsamic glaze.

Palate: nutty, buttered toast, bright cherry tartness, salted pretzel, wood spice.

Medium finish for the proof. The peanut oil, tart fruit, barrel spice and red pepper is what hangs on.

In very subjective terms, if whiskey were music then this would have all the treble and the bass notes you want but missing some of the subtle, layered mid range that I got with 2017. Still very good, but not a profoundly great bourbon."

Finish: bright, hot, and lingering with cinnamon spice, tart apple, and mild caramel sweetness. Slightly drying. Long after the sip has passed, there’s a hint of caramel apple."
5.0,"Oily, sweet, and spicy.  It’s what bourbon is supposed to taste like. Amazing."
4.5,"Thanks again to my friend Mark for this sample of Stagg.

Look:  George T Stagg is pretty dark, almost brown but with orange edges on it. Lacing shows but no legs when lightly swirling around the glencairn.

Nose:  Like Bookers, this is just popping out of the glass. Cinnamon spices are noticeable from afar, clove, just really a lot of spice. A little bit of cherry pops up when I move in closer, showing the age of the bourbon.  From there I get more oak. I’m a little surprised at how little depth I get on the nose with the age Stagg is. I really don’t get any sweets 

Palate: The taste is much better than the nose, with those missing sweets of vanilla and brown sugar hitting the tongue first. The follow up are the spices and then oak.    Lingering on the tongue, I get more fruity flavor. There’s a good amount to taste on this one. Less sweet, more oak, and earthy/nutty quality than Stagg Jr. 

Finish: oak, but the bitterness isn’t as high as other bourbons I’ve had. There’s a little bit of sweetness lingering on the tongue. Pretty dry finish as well. 

Overall:  I like Stagg, it’s very similar to its younger partner, but with more oak and maybe slightly less heat."

3.0,"I hope to do a SBS with the 2017 GTS soon.  First impressions: Acetone on the nose, but not in a way that is offensive because it still smells like bourbon.  That being said, I couldn't really get around the acetone to pick up much else.  The oak is heavy on the palette, with a nice oily viscosity.  Take it slow and you can pick up a faint hint of baking spices, and then the bitterness comes in.   Adding a few drops of water only serve to enhance the bitterness.  You would think the viscosity would lend a nice long finish but instead your reward is more bitterness and a short finish.  Unfortunately, I do not think this will stack up well against the 2017.  This bottle is worth retail, or trading for (assuming your are giving up a bottle you paid retail for).  I will NOT be searching out more of these at the current secondary prices.  I have picked up several of the 2017 bottlings at secondary prices."

5.0,"When I'm bored with bills, TV, red tape, and work- I go to distiller.com in search of little shreds of excitement, excitement to find information that might send me on a journey find something unique, something secret, something that gets me excited again, perhaps like when I was younger. I'd imagine many of you are in the same boat - after finding family, success, education and organization in you life - what's next? I think the ""what's next?"" premise is the conduit that binds us together here. Whiskey tickles parts of our brain that were once easily excitable, but are now more numb, predictable, it jump starts the parts of the senses that often say ""been there done that"".  
George T. Stagg whiskey is a wonderful example of something special, perhaps secret to most, made with care, uniqueness, and of top notch quality. And it's made with magic of sorts: somehow only flavored with yeast, clear distillate, and old wood.. now; If you're a whiskey connoisseur - its easy to split hairs over allocation, age statement, ownership, politics, secondary market, and the obvious notion of ""why the hell can't I get that bottle too??"" - however (quiet voice), step way way way back from your whiskey biases and daily life tools for a moment, go to a quiet place, no screens , no screaming kids, no boss, off line - and take a nosing / neat sip of George T. Stagg- just as it is... Fantastic from start to finish- its just fantastic. ..Hot? yes - hot enough to make the demons think your mouth is a gateway back to hell -and its good. Complex? Yes; insanely,.. dozens of scents and flavors all packed into one- but it's not like jamming 5 different flavors of slushie into one cup - no no, all the flavors are decipherable and mature;  this is pure adulting at its finest! ..- I'm just happy that this stuff exists.

5.0,"We've tried two earlier editions of Stagg and raved about both (2013 and 2017).  Thankfully, Buffalo Trace has not let us down with this latest edition.  Stagg is hands-down the best rye-recipe bourbon that I've tried, with the best Elijah Craig Barrel Proof editions coming a close second.  It's so much older than typical bourbon releases, with an extra three years of age compared to the already well-matured ECBP, and has a characteristic and unmistakable resulting profile overflowing with stewed fruit, peanut oil, rich caramel, vanilla, green tea, salted dark chocolate, and lumberyard wood.  I often associate great bourbons with a note that's reminiscent of chocolate, and Stagg offers the clearest and best example of that slightly bitter but intoxicating flavor.  I doubt I'll be able to find or afford a bottle in the next five years, but this remains one of the best bourbons in the world and I can only hope that I'm lucky enough to try Fall 2019's release."

The taste is all of that and so much more. It starts rich and sweet, led by brown sugar, caramel and vanilla, but then leads to a surprise snap of dill and mint (and rosemary?) Before turning just ever so slightly dry and woody.  Finish is more mint and a bit of oak, leaving a very nice numbness on the cheek and gums for several minutes.  Incredible.  This is without question the best bourbon I've ever had."

4.5,"Deep amber color. Nose has intense cinnamon, vanilla and maraschino cherries, with oak and notes of sweet tea. Thick, oily mouthfeel, followed by fireworks going off in your mouth. Palate is a continuation of the nose with lots of cinnamon, vanilla, cherry cola, buttery toffee, and hints of sweet tobacco and oak char. Long, hot finish with more cinnamon and vanilla, lots of spicy oak and black pepper, and subtle hints of coffee and campfire. 

This is a very good bourbon that has all the notes you would expect in a very good bourbon. If anything sets it apart, it would be the intensity with which you find those characteristics. Everything seems concentrated. Not worth the price I paid, but it was a birthday treat for myself, so no regrets."

5.0,"Mind blown. Have not tasted prior releases, but a generous buddy poured me some of this the other night. Intense heat firebombs the palate for a split second, then vanishes to reveal an incredibly smooth (for its proof) yet rich mix of flavors: toffee, caramel, dried fruit, berries, cinnamon, butterscotch, and some mild oakiness. Finish isnt very long but boasts lingering cinnamon, butter, and oak. Need to spend more time with this one to really unpack it, but its ""nectar of the gods"" 5 star rating is well earned. Awesome."
5.0,Top notch.  So smooth at the proof.  Lots of cherry and oak.

5.0,"First time trying this, yes a lot of hype so hard to be truly objective.  That being said I won’t get carried away with all the flavors that come together in this.   The other reviews are accurate except I don’t get any type of mint.  Just delicious vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, and perfect amount of oak all come together boldly and beautifully.  It’s delicious, truly an exceptional bourbon that is going to make me reevaluate others I have rated before.  I love pure higher proof stuff but this is the only bourbon where (to me) everything really came together perfectly and will make truly appreciate what finish and mouthfeel are all about.  A 1.5 finger pour neat lasted about 30 min, enjoyed it immensely, what a great experience.  Can’t wait to share this with my friends and family...."

5.0,"Neat.  Blast of heavy vanilla, toffee, maple glaze, and a hint of eucalyptus and chocolate.  I know this is Mash 1 but I am picking up a good amount of Rye.  This is the first time I have had GTS.  It’s a brighter nose than I was expecting.  The oak is just a background note filling in the gaps around the other flavors.  

Incredibly thick and oily on the tongue.  All deep and dark on the tongue despite what I said about the nose.  Brown sugar, cinnamon and oak, intensely.  On the taste, flavors are intense and come in waves, legs keep coming in waves too.  It’s so oily that it just coats and coats and runs down your mouth and throat.  Let me try to break this down....

It’s a reverse of all the flavors I mentioned before.  The taste starts dark, heavy oak, cinnamon, and a dark vanilla.  It’s mutes for a moment and then my mouth lights on fire with intense vanilla and maple glaze.  Get that hint of eucalyptus again at the end.

Then it doesn’t stop.  The legs flow and flavors keep coming.  It mutes for a moment, more vanilla.  Mutes, then more cinnamon.  Mutes, more vanilla.  That will just keep happening for minutes later.  Longest legs of anything I have ever had.

This is such a delicious experience.  Lives up to the ridiculous hype.

Legs still going by the way...."

5.0,"A generous taste courtesy of Pie Chef Guy.

Wow. This is it. The grandaddy bourbon. Been looking forward to this for a long time.

I immediately notice the strong scent of vanilla, butterscotch, toffee and brown sugar. The taste is buttery and sweet with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, magic, fairy dust, viper venom, stardust and a touch of oak. It's like Nilla Wafers on steroids, coated in maple and applesauce.

This is DAMN good!"

4.5,So this one is really great. Definitely a top bourbon with a nice long finish and it’s very smooth. Light hint of cherries with some vanilla/oak mix. This year’s pappy blew this out of the water for me though. Stagg is good but I think jr may hang right with this.

4.75,"Quite a bourbon.

Nose: heavy alcohol, of course as this is well over 130 proof, vanilla, brown sugar, burnt caramel, oak, and toasted nuts.

Flavor: Heavy vanilla.  Caramel, toasted coconut, caramelized sugars, dark chocolate, wood in the background.  Tastes a lot like a Samoas Cookie.

Finish: Long like a hot summer Saturday.  Lasts forever and changes and matures the longer you wait.  Definitely a slow sipper.  Ginger, black pepper, leather, more spices, and almost a hint of fennel.

Overall a great slow drinking bourbon.  For the cost and difficulty to obtain I'd stick with Stagg Jr.  It's a better value though not as smooth or complex."

4.5,"Complex and beautiful nose with lots of oak, cinnamon and butter toffee . Palate was strong with lots of baking spice, cherry and vanilla. Finish was loooooong with caramel, cherry cola and more oak"
4.0,"At $700 this falls far short of anything I would consider spending that level of money on. Being in the trade has its perks though and this is a very excellent bourbon. 

Caramel, Butterscotch, Cinnamon Red Hots, Walnut shell

Very good. Very not worth the price unless money is meaningless to you."

4.75,"Big oak, vanilla, red cherry, caramel and some heat. This is a challenging bourbon for those who are barely getting into barrel proof. I suggest you let this sit for twenty minutes and add some water to it as you go. This and any other barrel proof expressions aren't for the faint of heart. 

 To me, this bourbon is the bottle of the year. I managed to get this bottle after hunting it down since last year. I was very lucky to score this bottle for under $100."

5.0,"Rested 10 minutes. Served neat in a bar glass. 

Nose - oak, cinnamon at Christmas time, dark caramel, vanilla
Palette - flavor bomb. Very oily. Sourdough, toasted oak, vanilla, a slight hint of dark chocolate
Finish - long, smooth, lingering finish. Sends a deep warming feeling into your soul. 

Honestly, it’s a perfect bourbon. So well balanced."

5.0,"The nose is delightful. Super soft and delicate for 125 proof. Light caramel sweetness with a bit of floral ness and campfire smoke. There is so much going on on the palate. The sweetness lightens up even more, fresh tobacco, and an herbal spice wrestles with the caramel, in a very beautiful way. It lingers for about a minute, and keeps you coming back for more. Adding a few drops of water goes a long way as well."

5.0,"Nose- confectioners sugar, caramel, vanilla toffee, brown sugar, candied ginger, peaches, musty oak, cherries. Super complex nose

Palate- burst of cinnamon candies coated in sugar initially, leading to caramel, dark cherries, plums, candied ginger, brown sugar, dry wood, old leather, vanilla, tobacco, a whole bouquet of flavors... the list goes on and on. 

Finish- incredibly long, drying finish with notes of cinnamon spice, heavy oak, vanilla, caramel, fresh fruits... the list goes on and on. Just like the palate 

One of the most complex whiskies that i’ve tried. A true masterpiece of bourbon. No complaints whatsoever. Perfect balance and drinks way below its proof."

4.75,"750 ml bottle poured into a snifter, served neat. Lucked out on VA ABC's lottery in November 2018. Nice dark golden amber color. Aromas of caramel, citrus peel, a little butterscotch, spice, some vanilla, well masked alcohol. Tastes of caramel, butterscotch, citrus peel, spice, vanilla. Warming finish. A bit hot on the first few pours but really nice once your palate adjusts and you know what to expect."

Sweetness on the nose classic carmel, vanilla, quite enjoyable, flawless
Palate which I had hoped would be a continuance of the nose fades fast into lingering spice/ heat
