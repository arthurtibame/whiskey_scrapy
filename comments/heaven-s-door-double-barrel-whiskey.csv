4.0,"On the nose it is not dissimilar to Michter's American but with more oak. Way more oak. That made me a little trepidatious. My first couple of small quick sips that was the theme, very oaky influence. On the third sip I chewed it for a while and found this wonderful explosion of spices and nuttiness to go with the underlying caramel and the oak which was still there but had nestled back into the background. I let it sit for a bit and returned to it and the glass had really opened up. Spices and caramel led the way. Definitely some nuttiness and still the oak but it no longer seemed as raw. By the end of the glass it was a whiskey I was thoroughly enjoying and I'm diving in for another glass. The finish is something else. Still wrestling with exactly what it is. It is rather dry, sort of herbally with perhaps some liqorich in there. I'm still not sure. Not unpleasant at all, but certainly not a finish of the sort I've run across with any frequency, more like a rum than a whisky"

4.0,"Neat
Nose: wheaty and oaky upfront, strong vanilla, baked apple pie spice, some toffee. 
Palate: rich! spicy cherries up front, fruity candied apples, heavy on the dark chocolate cherries. Moderate to lengthy finish. All around good one! Not as overwhelmingly molasses or sugary as Woodford double Oaked."
3.75,"Very enjoyable.  Every sip brings out some different notes. Spicy but not overly, calmed by caramel and vanilla."

3.75,"This is very similar to the Heaven’s Door Tennessee Bourbon, but with a little less spice, and more smooth. The sweet, vanilla notes are present as well, and it retains some of the spicy character of the other variety. I’ll give it a slightly higher rating because it is smoother."

3.5,"Nose is almost straight alcohol, but it is a lot smoother than the nose, good thing!  Not a bad sipper....more of an everyday than special occasion pour.  Would like to see this around $40/btl than $50+ where it is now.  12/23/18"

3.0,Too minty and spicy/cinnamon for my tastes. But had to have a pour for those in tonight’s GoT who are now knocking on Heaven’s Door.
3.75,"Vanilla scents with a kick in your face bourbon taste of burning, fruits, and spice. Goes down smooth.  A sophisticated sipping whiskey.  Tasted it neat.  Would recommend a try!"
2.25,"This line of Whiskeys have yet to reach the AZ market and piqued my interest with there unique finishing and largely positive reviews. 
For background this is a sourced Whiskey based in TN started by one of the guys responsible for Angels Envy. They ""collaborated"" with Bob Dylan (outside of using his lyrics and likeness who knows what else Mr Dylan contributed!) to release a line of 3 Whiskeys. A bourbon, a rye and this one (a blend of 3 straight Tennessee Whiskey's finished for over a year in heavily charred ex Bourbon barrels) Age, source and mashbills are all undisclosed. This one picked up a Double Gold Medal at this year's SF Spirits competition. On to the tasting!
Upon entry it's pretty astringent with an all spice, wood smoke and tobacco note. More oak with some pepper on the mid pallette to end with a lingering, yep you guessed it oak note. I dropped a rock in hoping to tame the oak and bring forth some sweeter notes and it did that to some extent. There is no getting around it this one is over oaked. A huge oak bomb. If that's your desired taste profile, buy this one! Otherwise it's a pass for me at $44. Sometimes you throw up a shot hoping it's a buzzer beater and it turns out it's just an air ball! Cheers all!"

3.25,Spicy!
3.75,Really nice comfortable heat. Just enough to enjoy sipping it. Initial Flavor is really clean and soft.
4.5,"Nose - heavy oak, rich, smells very full flavored - Hard to not taste it yet... High alcohol is evident.  Caramel and vanilla.  A bit of water opens up notes of apple or pear

Palate - full rich beginning.  Flavor hits the entire mouth.  Well balanced oak.  Dry tannins.  Even with water, heavy oak still comes through.  Nice spices and not too sweet.  Not knowing the mashbill when tasting, possibly high rye? I can imagine this makes a fantastic cocktail.

Finish - lingering tingling on the sides of my tongue and a dryness on the palate.  Long and lingering oak

Really delicious whisky and it would be one to grab when you can't decide which bottle you want.  Not disappointed with having purchased this bottle not having tried it before!"

3.25,"Bought this on the recommendation of a store clerk and his personal notes of it and the fact that my neighbor said he really liked it so worst case, my neighbor drinks it all when we hang out. 

Okay so on to the tasting. Gonna keep it pretty simple because this bourbon is sourced and if I’m wrong about where this is sourced then I don’t know whiskey. Smells like Dickel, unmistakable vitamin smell. Tastes like.....Dickel BIB 13year almost exactly. I wish I still had the Dickel laying around to do a side by side even without it I can almost guarantee this is the same juice. 

Is it good? Well I did like the Dickel BIB.... a lot. But I also only paid $35 for the real Dickel vs $50 for Bob Dylan’s version. So the short answer is yes, it’s good, but I won’t be buying again based on the availability of the Dickel 13 year BIB being pretty easily available in my area. 

3/7/20"

3.5,"After some really odd tasting drams (yes I'm looking at you Rebel Hill single barrel, New Southern Rye and a very very odd Grappa I've forgotten the name of) this is refreshing. It's not unique or even interesting but straight down the middle of the road no surprises decent. I won't try and strain to find meaningful flavor profiles but then again that's not what this one is about it's just a decent straight fwd drop. Cheers @PBMichiganWolverine!"
3.75,Very mild taste. The feel is noticeably thicker in the mouth. The finish has a nice mild spice.

3.5,"The only one of the three that was somewhat interesting. Wood, wood for sure. But this base profile from Heavens Door is sweet and very hot. I'm assuming when Bulliet hit the market back in the day it was the same thing. So I guess we can say we can wait a few years to see where this one will lead. Im interested in that though. But dont expect much other than sweet, hot and woody rustic notes. I'd rather drink Wathens 8 generations or Bulliet Barrel Strength."
3.5,"Nose:  spicy, cinnamon, apple, vanilla, oak
Palate:  strong alcohol heat, spicey, oak, maple 
Finish:  medium length finish, lingering burn from the alcohol, spice, mild sweetness 
A little bit of water tames some of the alcohol heat and brings out a little more sweetness and a bit of cedar"

4.0,"Strange one, but I dig it! On the nose it smells hot and spicy, so I was preparing for that, but once it hit my mouth, smooth and classic bourbon flavors. You definitely get a little extra oakyness (not sure if that’s a word), but it’s really nice and goes down easy. Nothing mind blowing in there, just a great sipper to hang out with."

5.0,Firm whiskey with a strong backbone and smooth finish.  Great as a cocktail but beautiful on its own.
3.75,"Rich, oily, vanilla, minimal spice, easy sipper, cross between woodford double oaked for the vanilla and a willett finish"
3.75,"Nose: Fruity and floral with apricot, strawberries and cherries. Cinnamon and brown sugar dusted apple Danish. There's just enough spicy but fragrant oak to give the nose good structure. [The dry glass aroma is all brown sugar and spicy oak].

Palate: The entry is spicy but not hot, and quickly softens in the development. It's a friendly but well-defined arrival with dill, clove and caraway flavours and the development has real progression with little wavelets of spice rolling through it. Vanilla, berries, some ashy treacle and a little licorice appear as it evolves. The texture is good - reasonably full but there is a very light astringent touch that I like a lot.

Finish: Medium/short. The spicy oak notes are the last to fade and there is a mild minty/menthol note and some oily dill from the rye component that lasts into the aftertaste.

I quite enjoyed this bourbon but sadly my sample bottle had leaked and there was only about 10 ml left to taste, so I had to really search for aromas and could not taste it with water.

There is supposed to be an allocation coming to Australia soon but the anticipated price is $199 and I'm not paying that much. I would pay around $100, but no more.

Thanks to @Soba45 for the tasting sample.

""Good"" : 3.75 stars"
