3.75,Sour cherry taste with the warmth of a good whiskey. Different but good!
2.0,"In the beginning it seemed very intriguing: natural juice matured with American whiskey for several months, an interesting aroma flavor. But eventually it appears to be disappointment, probably due to the expectations were a bit high.
Concentrated cherry juice (more sour than sweet), some rye and classic American whiskey notes and (might be a result of mixing the previous two) a strong leather and asphalt aroma to the nose.
But the taste is not that interesting and satisfying - what seemed to be a successful mixture turns out to be plain and inappropriate - the leather note does not quite correlate with an extremely sweet juice and whiskey so it may make a drinker feel uncomfortable.
The finish and the aftertaste are the only things to be ultimately satisfying and pleasurable."
