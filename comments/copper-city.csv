null,Mild sweet taste to start. Aroma of caramel. Taste fades to warmth.

3.5,"Experiencing neat:  Nose has some ethanol heat, eucalyptus, menthol, caramel, vanilla, oak.  Tasting starts with light sweetness, vanilla, oak, then some heat and spice from the alcohol, red hot cinnamon, black pepper, and green herbal rye notes. The cinnamon sticks around a while and is joined by the caramel, vanilla, and oak.  The flavor finish is medium long, but some tannins and saccharine stay around a bit longer

Not a ground breaking bourbon as it is MGP sourced at the moment (currently aging their own juice) and I can taste a lot of Bulleit/High West Rye in it.  Speaking of Bulleit and High West, ADC definitely plays off the Old West and uses a unique bottle, with their brand name cast into rough cast glass.  A nice touch and deserves a little bonus along with reasonably pricing the product.  Try worthy for Bulleit Rye and Bourbon, High West Double Rye, and 1792 fans"
2.0,"Not bad, but that is about all I can say. A background whiskey that has nothing to remember it by. Nothing negative mind you, but nothing positive either."

2.0,"Nose: Overwhelmed by the smell of gin. Juniper. Very off-putting
Taste is a little more ""bourbon-like"" but can't get past the gin smell every time I take a sip."
3.0,Not to harsh. Slightly sweet. Decent finish. Better than Jack straight.

2.0,"They source their bourbon or did initially.  A batch I tasted last year seemed very different than a recent bottle which was corn flavor and under aged.  If they are now distilling their own, they should stop because it's not a good product.  If they are still a non-distiller bottler they are sourcing immature product.  Either way it's over priced and tastes too young."

1.75,"“Peaty” mouth. Gin like, juniper, somewhat sour. Caramel and vanilla nose."
2.5,"Nose: faint overall with slight vanilla, notes of juniper and moderate ethanol

Palate: light caramel with rye spice, but lacks maturity, depth, and complexity 

Finish: spicy dry medium long with mouth warmth for its proof

I always like to support local products, but I believe this bourbon left me a little short and wanting more."
3.0,"Some pine, vegetation notes on the nose, almost a bit sour. Malty cereal finish.

Included in a Bourbon Charity blind tasting. Voted number four for me out of 5 AZ whiskies. This compared to the other Arizona whiskies was quite the enigma. Liked that I couldn’t quite peg it but wouldn’t really order it if other options were available. 

Sampled at home."
3.5,"Sweet at first with heavy notes of caramel, bit of a hot finish. Perfect with one ice cube"
3.0,"Sourced from Indiana (MGP?) but aged, bottled in AZ. light golden color.  Nose was faint/light... really hard to detect notes.  Palate was average... nothing special but not offensive either.  Worth a taste for the curious but a bottle might disappoint some."

2.5,I had really high hopes for this one with it being produced here in Arizona.  sad to say I won't be buying it again.  I didn't care for it neat so used it in Kentucky Mules.
3.0,Light and Smooth
