3.75,"Pleasant nice, peppery finish."
3.0,"Spicy, almost like a rye. Not as well balanced as the Founder's Reserve."
3.75,Quite a different touch with the cognac finish. Good value for the money!

3.5,In the same category price as a lot of 12 year old scotches makes this a difficult one to rate there are a lot I would rather own but this is worth tasting as it is unique raisins nutty sweet white dessert wine I guess is the cognac finish very smooth

4.0,"Subtle flavour and smooth light texture is instantly noticeable, from the addition of the cognac I’d assume. As it sits on the palette, flavours begin to dance, reminding you why this release is so special."
3.5,Very smooth and easy to drink. The cognac is very evident when you smell the whisky as is some sweetness.
5.0,Smooth and Sweet. Follow's in the path of other good Glevlivets. Was pleasantly surprised by the honey taste.

4.25,"This is a great scotch, I always felt the 15 was missing something and a little boring. The captains reserve has that missing element. It is just as smooth but the flavour is more pronounced and that cognac finish rounds it out. Both regularly around $70CAD but can be had on sale for $20 less, I will always pick the captain going forward."

Beau, bon pas cher!
Une belle surprise en cette soirée festive de tempête hivernale. Quand j'ai mis mon nez au-dessus de ce verre, je me suis immédiatement imaginé une bouteille de plus de 100$. Mais à moins de 70$, ce scotch mielleux devrait faire partie de ma réserve sous peu. Le seul hic, non disponible en ligne!"
