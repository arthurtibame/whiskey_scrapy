4.0,"Scent of lemon zest and light vanilla; taste is definitely tropical - reminiscent of amarillos (Puerto Rican plantains, caramelized and spiced); allspice and marmalade, with a great resinous feel to it. Pleasant in every way, this is simply delicious; perfectly balanced and one of the most wonderful finishes of anything I've tried - mildly fruity but rich and spiceful in its lingering. I must say, more of a 4.5 than just 4 - this one will be on my shelf for a while."

1.0,"Sweet, more sugar and then sweet again and more sugary tastes. Distateful. Very much on the ""right side"" of the scale used on Distiller, which I find very useful (peaty on the very left, floral on the very right). Not for me. Gave it away to someone who qualified it ""dishonest""..."

3.0,"Tequila on the nose initially, but opens up to vanilla and bananas.  Sweet, fruity (pear) with a touch of pepper on the tongue.  Spicy finish that fades softly"

3.0,"Needs time and water to open up (up to 10-15 minutes) - nose starts with tart fruit, lemons and pears, and eventually brings malty vanilla caramel not unlike auchentoshan but less sweet. Bright fruit and spice taste mellows with time and malty vanilla increases. In my opinion the floral citrus notes overpower the sweetness at first but then bloom with a touch of water and time. (84)"

5.0,"The nose reminds me of an assortment of yellow sweets -- banana pudding and butterscotch candies and lemon bars. The palate is sweet and creamy with luscious, custardy notes of vanilla and banana. The finish is long and spicy, with cinnamon red-hots. Beware: this one might give you cavities!"

4.0,"Thanks again Damon. This one is all about the desserts. Butterscotch pudding and cool whip, crunchy butterscotch cookies, spiced cakes; coffee cake, cinnamon and nutmeg."
5.0,"Oh my... The richest of the Glenrothes sampler I've compared, the whole chorus singing out in harmony! Nose opens with intense golden honey, sweet sherry, apple-blossom and Anjou pear. Petrichor like bright crepuscular rays bursting down into an ancient forest after a thunderous summer squall. Added water also seems to reveal something earthy and dark in the background, maybe freshly ground coffee? Palate is immediate, baking spices and zesty ginger. Pear returns for the finish along with buttery malt and a touch of humming sherry... An impressive showing, I'll be searching for a fifth of this. Dry glass: No thank you, pour me another."

Rum-raisins, caramel, juicy pear finish, soft nuttiness. Medium finish. Touch of milk/fudge chocolate. 

Warm spiciness, like mild cinnamon. 

Thick chewy 

Mild moderate burn."

4.5,"I have never had a bad Glenrothes.

Absolutely complex, difficult, rewarding, that is the proper way to describe this dram.

Bottled at 43%abv, with an Amontillado Sherry color.

On the nose it evolves with every sniff, starts with butter and cream notes, then changes into lemon peel, wet forest, prunes, pepper and after tasting it, you can find toasted sugar or caramel in it.

On the palate is rich, flavorful and complex. A little bitter, a little sweet. Main notes are: ashes, caramel, tobbacco, oak, honey and spent fireworks, very balanced, a nice wrap. 

Finish is long and fruity with prune notes on it. Very good dram, i give this one a solid 92 over 100."

Whisky tasting"
3.5,Sweet and tasty. Bang for the buck

4.0,"Rich and luscious. Dried dark fruit and apricot, cocoa/baking chocolate, vanilla, coconut flakes, and amarone wine on the nose. The mouth beautifully harmonizes these elements - baking spice, creamy (but not overly sweet) dark chocolate, amarone, and creamy coconut. A delicious after-dinner dram - well worth seeking out!"

null,Butterscotch on the nose; excellent aroma!! The taste is a bit of a letdown with a faint remnant of the nose.
