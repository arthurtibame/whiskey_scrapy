3.0,"This is actually the 15 year old but it isn’t available:
Need to try in a proper Glencairn glass so this review isn’t really complete. Some interesting flavours (light, green fruit, honey) on the nose. Fair bit of alcohol burn though on arrival as we as the finish although a fairly muted middle (both alcohol and flavours). Again, will try in a proper glass and add another taste :)"

4.0,"Nose: Sherry and oak are the immediate impressions, not surprisingly. Orange peel, a little vanilla. Some light ginger-pepper spiciness. It's what I think of as a ""good standard sherried nose"".

Palate: A light arrival - juicy and a little spicy with fruit and sherry flavours. It expands in the development with oak and malt coming to the foreground with quite a lot of gingery spices. A rich palate but by no means sweet - dry and juicy, a good combination. Clean and creamy malt. Some subtle warm spices (ground ginger, allspice) and a little nuttiness. It gathers strength and there is a warming rush in the late development.

Finish: Surprisingly long, with sherry and oak being the final memories.

Not a sherry-bomb, more like sherry-cordite. This is a crisp and clean whisky, with clearly defined aromas and flavours. It's not complex but delivers its straight-forward character in a precise and honest fashion.

It reminds me a little of GlenDronach 12 year ""Original"", although that whisky has more up-front oakiness, whilst this one features the sherry, but both are strongly cask-driven. This is also a little more dry, but both stand as great representative sherry finish whiskies.

It's not my favourite style, but it is done well here with a classic fruity nose, malty cereal palate and woody finish. A dash of water broadens the nose and brings out a little hint of honey, but robs it of the punch it has when neat. It's a coin-toss whether it's an improvement or not.

On the palate, water brings out some sweetness but doesn't contribute much more. I'd recommend taking this one neat. This is well crafted whisky and I agree with the official notes here that it would make an admirable aperatif, particularly on a chilly evening when the warming quality would be lovely.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
