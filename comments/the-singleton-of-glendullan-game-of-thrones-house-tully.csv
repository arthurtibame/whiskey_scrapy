3.75,Interesting flavor. I like the green apple. I think they could have done better.
3.5,"On the sweeter side: Green apple vs pear.
Not too much complexity, likely due to immaturity"

3.5,"Slight oakiness on the nose with sweetness. 

On the palate, strong oak flavor with a bit of apple at the start. Not overly sweet but certainly noticable. Balances out on the finish as with any good scotch. 

Smooth on the finish at room temp, probably even smoother on the rocks. 

Only complaint is the green apple on the palate."
3.75,Kind of sweat but has a slight PM flavor.

3.5,tobacco on the end and it lingers
3.75,"Lots of malt and baking spices on the nose. Other reviews say there’s some green apple but I get more of a warm apple pie. Nice and mellow on the palate and a decently long finish with no burn. 

From a marketing standpoint, this one (along with Greyjoy and Tyrell houses) hits the mark and you can’t argue with the $30 price tag."

2.75,"Ripe fruits and vanilla, happy to have tried this but likely won’t be a repeat customer"
3.25,Sweet rich buttery. Tobacco and apricot

1.0,"The Michelob Ultra of the GOT lineup. Disappointing overall. If you want it to be spicy, either knock me on my ass or don’t be present at all. The spice in here is this tiny tiny amount that’s more annoying. So watery I can’t really taste anything, kind of like the Tully’s resolve."

3.5,Smoky heather honey with a lot of overripe fruit. A dash of water opened it up to much more depth of flavor. Very smooth.

4.0,"Nose: Deceivingly sweet, heather, mixed berries, salted caramel and buttered toffee
Palate: Peat Smoke, Damp Moss, dark chocolate and finishes on a hint of smoked meat.
Contrary to those here this was actually pretty great! Not as simplistic as I was expecting- this a great bottle to introduce yourself to peatier whisky without skimping complexity."

3.5,Love the heather and honey and spice finish was maybe a little pricey at 69 Cad as there are some other great alternatives at this price point but it was worth trying especially if your a GOT fan

3.75,"Packs a lot of flavor for its 40% strength. There’s loads of citrus fruit on the nose, with Meyer lemons and green apples coming to mind. The palate is rich and malty with caramel and some more of the fruity notes. Sweet and spicy on the finish. I’d happily drink this at a bar. Well played, House Tully."
2.75,"Thin on flavor, feel, and finish. Young, sweet, and weak. Heather and mint on the nose. Sweet apple, oak, and vanilla.  Not much happening throughout, not impressive at all"
4.0,"Smooth, hints of apple, vanilla"
3.25,"Very malty nose.  A little yeasty/funky.  Toasted barley.

Strong cereal elements- slight toasted barley flavor.  A touch of sweetness and quite malty, reminds me of oat crackers.  A decent amount of peppery spice.  A hint of brown sugar and heather.

Nothing spectacular, but pretty pleasant, particularly considering how cheap it is."
3.0,"Very woody taste,nice sipping game of thrones series"
1.75,Had peaches on the nose.  Otherwise it’s a watery smoke taste that I don’t care for.

3.5,"★★★½
Avent 2019 - 8/24.
Pour une troisième fois cette année, je fais une fiche de ce whisky et j'ai toujours la même impression. Un bon whisky de base sur des fonds mielleux et vanillés, mais dont le prix inclus la marque de commence de la légendaire série télévisée. Correct sans plus, à acheter seulement pour impressionner à vos amis."
3.75,"I get fruit syrup, apricots and peat smoke on the nose, sweet on the palate with apples, pears and a hint of peat smoke, the medium finish intermingled the sweet notes with a hint of peat smoke.
A splash of water muted the sweetness all around."

3.5,"It is exactly what you expect from every singleton, a light fruit juice. This one is the Game of Thrones special edition, from the ""House Tully"", it is called ""Select"". Another NAS whisky intended for collection.

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, very fruity. Green apples, some clove, pears, acetone, sider, apricots.

On the palate is very spicy actually, i was not expecting that. Not unpleasant at all, actually it is a mixture of spices. Mostly herbal spices like rosemary and clove. Peppery and clove finish, long but dim. 

Actually not a bad whisky, but i wouldn't buy it since you can get much better for the same price. 78/100."
3.75,"Beautiful aroma of vanilla, honey, and berries with a nice light taste on the floral and sweet taste buds."

2.75,Really enjoy this single malt on the nose. Loses its luster in the taste. Feels like too many tastes competing for your affection and falls flat. Not a bad scotch however to share with some friends.
