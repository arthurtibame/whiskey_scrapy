3.0,"On the nose I get artificial orange juice, York peppermint patties, and light chocolate. About the same on the palate; everything is very light including hints of cinnamon and pineapple juice. The finish brings vanilla and the mouthfeel of the salt that stays in your mouth after you have bacon and eggs, without the bacon and eggs flavor however. This is a gentle whisky, one that I'd let my dad, sister, or anyone else try that's new to whisky. I think it has its time and place, nothing flashy, but it's enjoyable. I'd compare it to my Aberlour 12 yr Double Cask except toned down and easier to sip."

4.0,"It's like a mashup of scotch with classic bourbon flavor. As someone who equally enjoys scotch & bourbon, and often can't decide which to drink, this is a treat. It's an untypical drink, which may not go over well with some palates - especially if you are used to more expensive, traditional whisky. I'm all about trying new flavors, and this was definitely different than the rest."

1.0,"Sitting in front of the tree on the unbelievably warm December with some Christmas music playing so figure I might as well be sipping a scotch.  The initial wave of aromas starts with tangerine with salted caramel.  As it opens, over some fair amount of time, cinnamon notes become apparent.  A soft, thin texture on the palate that carries caramel, which quickly fades to a bitter orange rind.  A small amount of black pepper begins the finish.  The palate is left bitter of the rind, with some cinnamon.  The addition of a small amount of water mutes the nose somewhat but doesn't alter the aromas.  The sweeter side of the dram is drawn out, pulling the bourbon traits of brown sugar and vanilla. Much better dram with water and is a must.  Decent for what it is: a blended, sweet, Dewars scotch. The high review sparked my initial interest, but found myself disappointed as I expected more.  79/100][Opened: 12/13/15; Revisited: 1/2/16]"
1.0,"I bought this one based on the  high rating here ( lesson learned----follow recommendations from tried sources, not new ones).  The nose is almost like acetone.  A smell that jolts memories of my sophomore chem class isn't good.  The taste is even worse.  No depth or character, with a bitter behind-the-throat scratchy finish.  I've not had many blends before--maybe I'm spoiled by the only ones I've had ( Hibiki 12 and 17, and the Compass Box ones).  But--spend a few bucks more and get the Compass Box Great King St blend... For a few bucks more, the quality is by far superior."

3.0,Not bad. Tried it for something new.   Not too much difference between this and standard white label.  Only difference is the scratch cask is sweeter and has more vanilla notes.

4.0,"For a low cost scotch, the scratched cask from Dewars is surprisingly good.  It's  very smooth with a nice dark chocolate covered cherriy flavor profile in the forefront.  I'm not a fan of the regular white label but this was a definite pleasant surprise.  A great bargain."

3.0,"A fine starting point for beginners, and you could do worse in the gift-giving department. An admirable effort by Dewar's. It is terribly sweet, but solid and consistant, without the off-putting buttery note of their standard issue."

3.0,"[05.14.2016] A little pre-grad party (mine, finally!) dram. This is good, as are most Dewars products, but not as good as I hoped. Probably because the char doesn't lead the blend to be as smoky as I wanted. Description in the tasting review above is pretty true to my own experience. Strong floral and citrus notes early, and very smooth mouthfeel. Vanilla really drives the train from there with a mild ending akin to Spring air. Nice whiskey, but no strong characters."

5.0,"Hell of a deal for a blended Scotch. I've always preferred Walker Black in the mid-priced blended Scotch realm...until I tried this. Wow! Blows away Dewars white, and Dewars 12 year, and stands up strong to Mr. Walker's 12 year amazingly well.
This is sweet, silky Scotch with nice smokey undertones- easy drinking and delicious."

3.75,"Nose is 75% Dewar's and 25% Bourbon. Enters sweet like a bourbon with light  smoke and old leather in the middle. Dark chocolate finish that coats and lingers. Agreed, this is a home run."

2.0,"I'll start off with damning by faint praise, and say that it's better than JW Red Label.  The nose is bitter, with a lot of chemicals, mostly turpentine and acetone.  If you dig around for awhile, you might get a hint of honeysuckle and a fresh floral arrangement.  Even after sitting for awhile, the chemicals still persist, albeit at a slightly lower strength.  The palate is thin, and if you hunt around for malt, you can find it, but the grains dominate this drink.  A hint here or there of heather, honey and vanilla, but it's overshadowed by astringency and cereal notes.  The finish is short, and I don't know that I'd want it any other way.  It's not spit-it-out bad, but the remainder of this bottle will be used for cooking and a new one will never grace the confines of my whisky rack.  I was really hoping this would come through, especially with the glowing praise it received from Mr Mayhew, but in the end, I reaffirmed I don't like anything Dewar's, and confirmed that Mr Mayhew and I have completely different palates."
4.0,"I agree with the expert review on this one. And, that’s not always the case. This is a very enjoyable dram at this price point. My go to affordable blends have been Monkey Shoulder and Isle of Skye, but they have made way for this one. Sure, I get some of the grain whisky in the aroma, but I also get apples and caramel. The mouth feel is not as thin as I thought it would be. Slight heat, cinnamon, that gives way to a really interesting sweet apple chocolate finish. Solid."

4.0,oh my!  very pleasantly surprised by this one.  so smooth.  nose I get on it of just-bitten pear.  taste is smooth fruity and nutty.  almost like a Glenlivet.  not bad.  I wonder what other scotches would taste like with the barrels charred and scratched.

4.0,"sample/I seriously can't believe how good this is, I will buy a bottle of this soon.  Light and sweet yet also w some body behind it.  Full: I've loved drinking this bottle.  Nose: toffee and brown sugar.  Overall, the smokiness here is so well balanced, I don't know how anyone could dislike this.  Finish is on shorter side though remnants of that smoke and very subtle fruit stay on the tongue. x bottle"

2.0,"One of Dewar's better, but it lacks in boldness. This is a very light dram, full of sweetness and fruity tones. With all the mild, florally, airy notes drifting about, it  lacks any sort of anchoring flavor to help carry the drinker along the tasting journey. It was pleasant enough to drink (especially at the price point – about $25 at my local liquor store) and offered nice hints of vanilla and molasses, however, the taste dies quickly on the tongue  resulting in an entirely unmemorable Scotch. Like a cheap cologne, it comes on strong, offers a hint of depth and complexity, but ultimately falls apart all too quickly."

3.5,Solid for the cost. Good daily sipper
4.0,"I see this for $12 / bottle (a litre no less) and they're basically begging me to buy it. Fine, in for two. 

A fascinating love child of scotch and bourbon. Maybe the scotch took a business trip to the States. It met bourbon. They thought it would be a parting fling, a random hookup at the airport bar. Throwing fidelity and vows to the curb, the passionate interlude that wasn't supposed to be anything more than lust turns into a lifetime of child support payments and whispered family secrets.

But in this case, that lustful interlude is actually a really oaky, smokey, aroma with a spunky and rich mouthfeel. Lots of vanilla and oak, not much malt whisky flavor, but a fascinating hybrid of scotch and bourbon that works very well. I found this on clearance, hence the low cost."

3.5,"Nose: Slight dill pickle that fades to reveal pear, dark chocolate, touch of smoke
Palate: Salted almonds, honey.   Cinnamon and soft oak finish"
3.25,"Smoke, oak, sweet vanilla and caramel on the nose, smooth vanilla and caramel on the palate, slightly spicy and smokey medium finish"
3.75,"Nose
• Honey, oak, lemon, barley, some other grains, a little peat

Taste
• Light golden sugar /molasses, barley, slight oak vanilla/maple, heather, grain whiskey, very slight peat smoke, black pepper, 
• Finish is short/medium with some pepper and light barley flavors 

Pretty good and quite smooth, although a little underwhelming and watery. The good flavors fade too quickly. Finish is shorter than ideal, but expected given 40% ABV. I think it's certainly worth sipping and considering.
