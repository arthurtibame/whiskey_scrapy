4.0,"A beer deceiving whiskey that requires more than a sip. After a tumbler, I'm ready to order a case. A big burn on the front end but the finish is worth the wait. Heavy on caramel and smoke flavors, finishes surprisingly clean and leaves you wanting more. Must pick up especially at the price point."
