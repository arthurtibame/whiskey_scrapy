5.0,"The best whiskey I’ve had. Smooth, smooth, smooth. Vanilla notes are front and center right from the jump. Finish is perfect. I tend to like a lower proof so the 80 is right down my alley. Will definitely keep this on hand as long as possible"

4.5,"I had a chance to sample this whisky and found it to be an excellent splurge at the $160 price point. there are several flavor notes that I got with every sip: vanilla, caramel. it tastes more like liquid dessert than actual whisky to me, and while the finish is short, it kept me wanting to try one more sip."

3.75,"WhiskeyLive Dublin 2018 
This 2018 release is a fine tasting whiskey.  Let me say that. 

Mindy Kaling is a fine looking woman (and talented).  Let me say that.

But if the company you keep includes Sandra Bullock (Redbreast 21), Rihanna (Dair Ghaelach) and especially Anne Hathaway (Barry Crockett Legacy)  then prepare to be judged in that light."

4.0,"Reader Beware; whiskey review starts at paragraph two. The following is a golfing blueprint of southwestern Ireland for the benefit of my buddy and whisky guru, @LeeEvolved, who might someday make this trip. Where the odds of dying in a plane crash are 1 in 11 million, I can assure you they drop to 1 in 11 when driving the back roads of southern Ireland. Lee should keep these figures in mind when calculating his odds of venue survival. After spending 3 nights in Ennis and golfing 3 courses (Dromoland Castle, Lahinch, & Trump’s Doonbeg) we moved on to the lively village of Tralee, county town of County Kerry. From here we would cover another 5 links courses in 5 days (Ballybunnion’s Old Course & Cashen Course, Dooks GC, Dingle GC, and Tralee GC). The most impressive tracks from these groupings were the 2 courses of Ballybunnion with several others not far behind. The trip culminated with another move to the spirited town of Killarney. From this location we tackled the most picturesque leg of our journey with rounds at Waterville Golf Links on the Ring of Kerry and Old Head Golf Links of Kinsale. The course at Old Head was sculpted only 20 years ago on its cliffy headland that stretches 2 miles into the Atlantic, but it also hosts ruins dating back many centuries. A golfing nirvana, this was the highlight of the trip. 

Our tasting of Midleton Very Rare took place at the Pikeman Bar in Tralee‘s Grand Hotel. Unfortunately, this venerable setting wasn’t sufficient enough in raising the grade of this 2018 vintage. First released in 1984, this was the 35th iteration of a blend consisting of single pot still and single grain whiskies aged in ex-bourbon casks for 12 to 28 years. Each year the vintage can vary with 2019 an ex-bourbon aged from 13 to 34 years. Jim Murray has rated 32 of these releases with an average rating of only 84.6. Of this lot, he graded 8 in the lowly 70’s and only 6 in the lofty 90’s, with 95 being the highest grade. All of the offerings have been delivered at a consistent 40% ABV, and Murray’s meager reporting has done little to induce Midleton to up the ante. A pleasant and subtle nose brought hints of sweet vanilla, oak and spices, but lacked the ethanol punch capable of coining a description higher than “adequate.” Incredibly smooth on the palate, this was the whiskey’s signature attribute, but not uncommon amongst Irish blends and single pot stills. Drinkability is certainly a noble quality, but for 22 Euro a proper measure pour (35.5ml), we were expecting something more. On the palate, add pepper and citrus to the above formula and there you have it. An excellent whiskey; this one barely rings the bell at 4 stars."
4.25,Incredibly smooth. Almost too smooth. Very relaxing drink. Don’t drink or eat with anything. Savor slowly
4.25,"Sweet 
Not as good as 2017"
