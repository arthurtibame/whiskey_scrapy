2.25,"I got this as part of an advent calendar in 2016. I just found the box and realized I never finished my samplings.

The nose is sweet and potent. You can smell the alcohol but it isn’t completely unpleasant.

At first taste, you get a blast of spice and sweet caramel that fades to tart raisens and rubbing alcohol. The tartness remains in the aftertaste.

This isn’t my favorite drink. It’s not terrible, and I wouldn’t mind drinking it again, but I’m not sure I would buy a bottle for myself. I enjoy the immediate flavor but wasn’t a fan of how it almost soured in my mouth the more I drank. Perhaps a bit more aging, or maybe a longer barrell finish would do it well."
