3.0,"Very Peary on the nose, but surprisingly well balanced and smooth on the palate. A little band aid odor, similar to caol Ila but less pronounced. Woodsmoke. A little hot. A drop of water opens up the sweetness of sherry, a slight fruitiness. Interesting, pleasant."

4.0,"Usually, I think the Ardbeg distillery nails everything. There is an exception with their 10 year old. The Machir Bay from Kilchoman is what their 10 should be. Ditch that lime! Nose, lemongrass with a touch of earthy peat. This is comparable to the Lagavulin 8. Nice vegetative whiffs of that Islay coast of brine that I long to visit someday. Palate has that Laphroaig-ish quality of a nice balance of salt, smoke, pepper.. but add in some faint tobacco and sherry. The 46% ABV is decent, and I can see this comparing side by side with the Quarter Cask as well, but their 48% ABV slightly beats it for balance. Thanks Dreaming of Islay for the sample!"

4.0,"Sample provided generously by Generously Paul, for our Scotish Distilleries sample trade team.  I've had an earlier year of Machir Bay, which was fiery and strong.  This still has remnants of that, but smoothed out a few rough edges.  Citrusy lemon, clean peat.  Almost like a Lag 8, taken down a notch.  I love this distillery, and all of their products are from a range of good to excellent.   Thanks Paul for the sample!"

4.0,"Remarkable amounts of charcoal and cigar on the nose, like a smoldering barbecue pit and burnt ends.  The palate carries through on that promise, with rich ash and then a burgeoning sweetness of grilled pineapple.  The finish lingers beautifully, smoke curling upward from a spent cooking fire.  Warm, even hot, throughout.  Amazing for such a young scotch.  Similar to Ardbeg 10 with more citrus on the palate and finish."
4.0,"This is so far one of my favorite Islay scotch. I really enjoy how cohesive it is despite its young age (not perceptible), very delicate combination of peat, smoke, fruit sweetness, citrus.  Less in your face than Laphroaig 10 but in my opinion more enjoyable. I think it is a great value for the price point (I paid $54 at total beverage in Thornton, CO but I think it went recently to $64, still worth it)"

3.0,"Day 21. The last scotch. Now I only got 1 rum and 2 bourbons left. Today, we got one of the ""unspeakable"" scotches. Disclaimer, not 100% certain if it is the 2016 since there is no year on the bottle, but process of elimination tells me it is. On the nose you get some nice smoke, togehter with malty balrey notes, some citrus and peppery honey. Somewhat reminds me of the Laphroaig 10 but...not quite as good. The taste is light honey with smoked peacehs, some pepper and briney, salty notes all over it. A little bit on the thin side for my taste...almost as if you put half a shot of water in there. Not fun. The notes are all enjoyable, but feel watered down for some reason. The aftertaste is salty smoke and and doesn't stay for very long. Not a bad scotch by anyones definition, just not really my taste."

On the nose obviously a lot of peat and smoke, that comes back in the palate, along with salt, spices (pepper), and some grassy/citrussy notes.
Considering it's youth, this is a remarkable  balanced dram."

4.0,"I'm finally getting around to reviewing this Islay single malt that I've had sitting on my shelf for what seems like over a year. It's been open (but preserved with gas) since November 2016 and I've only had a few sips here and there. 

Kilchoman is Islay's newest distillery, established in 2005, but has quickly made a name for themselves. Grown, distilled and matured exclusively on Islay, always non chill filtered and natural color. This one is a pale straw color and bottled at 46% ABV. It is matured in ex bourbon casks and finished in sherry casks for a few months. Although it's a NAS expression, I believe it contains whiskies that are between 3-6 years old. This was bottled March 28, 2016

The nose is greeted immediately with bright citrusy peat. Like a lemon cake with powdered sugar that was rolled in a peat bed. Smoked bacon and cold bonfire ashes. Slightly medicinal Laphroaig-y notes. Brine, sea air and a mineral note. There is a faint sherry influence, some dates and raisins, but nothing all that strong or notable. More citrus emerges in the form light oranges. Some white grape juice towards the bottom of the glass adds some sweetness. Mostly just smoke after that. Very good for how young it is. 

Smoked brisket dusted with lemon zest on the palate. Salt and pepper with a little oak. There is a sweetness to it in the form of soft vanilla and caramel/butterscotch. Some vegetal notes with what I can only describe as a muted mint note in the background. Like with the nose, mostly just smoke after that. 

Medium to full bodied with a dry mouthfeel. 
The finish is a bit odd. It's long and short at the same time. Peat smoke lingers for a long long time, but everything else kind of falls off the table and becomes very dry. 

I have to say, if they can get this kind of quality out of 6 year old stock, Kilchoman has a very bright future ahead of them. For the age it is very good. Flawed in that it lacks complexity, but overall it hits all those peaty chords that I come to expect from Islay. For the price ($60) however, I'd rather save $10 and buy a Laphroaig 10 or Ardbeg 10 as I enjoyed them more than this one. Still, I'd be very to try a 10 or 15 year old Kilchoman (if they can keep theirs stocks up) in the future. 3.75
Cheers"

5.0,"There are two separate personalities at play here. On the one hand you have the peated, medicinal bass tones you would expect, but paired with a  peary, banana-ed fruit and sweetness that brings a smile to your face. It's a lovely whisky and comes together in a really unique and authentic way"

4.25,"Hmm no idea what year this MoM sample is from but I like it. Maritime oily mild peat balances nicely with vanilla and intertwined with a hint of citrus. For me this is a difficult type of dram to pull off as mild and subtle I usually find boring. It's got lovely balance, nice body and a decent amount of complexity. Everything is singing in harmony. 4 for me maybe even a 4.25."
5.0,"lemon, light smoke, pleasant acid, straw, quick finish on the tongue but lingering peat. An instant classic and personal favorite."
4.0,"Similar to earlier vintages. Lovely medicinal peat, tarred rope, and sea salt. Cedarwood plays a forward role on the palate, and mellow vanilla and light fruit follow. The aromatic wood and peat character dominate, and the dram’s finish is spicy and heated. Tasted in the great company of @heymitch at Dressel’s."
4.0,"I’m so glad to be able to share this with @Damon_Elliot. An excellent whiskey with a great peatiness, followed by a light, oily, salty, earthy, mushroom and cedar aftertaste. All in all, I would not hesitate to try this again, but the shared company was definitely the highlight of this pour."

Taste: cherry, vanilla, butter, burnt bacon, very sweet tomato, burning hay, marshmallow, black pepper. Finish is almost non existent.

Water eliminates almost all the sweet elements and really brings the bacon and burning hay. The finish then elongates into honey and bacon grease."

3.75,"Au nez : doux et frais, tourbe, caoutchouc léger, citron, vanille, léger oakiness et fruits secs
Au palais : âpre, sec et légèrement salé, citronné, tourbe légère et caoutchoutée qui laisse place à une fumée agréable et une note marine 
La finale est sèche, tannée et légèrement boisée puis la tourbe réapparaît par la suite 

Whisky agréable avec une personnalité et une originalité, notamment par sa touche tanique et ses note citronnées qui se marient bien avec une tourbe peu agressive mais pas discrète pour autant. Cependant on peut reprocher à ce whisky son léger manque de complexité, surtout au nez et son côté sec. De plus, le sherry n’a que trop peu d’influence, dommage.

Note personnelle : 86/100"

3.75,First you smell the ash but underneath are citrus and pears. On the palate the bourbon casks combine with the peat but then a surprisingly honey sweetness. The peat and ash return in the finish. Enough complexity even for a young release to be comparable to other more mature Islays.

Nose: peat, smoke, bright floral notes, honey, candied apples and pears. 

Taste: almost identical to the nose. Bomb of peat and smoke off the start. Fades into dense honey and stewed apples. Lingers for a good while. Very oily."

4.0,"This is an excellent medium peated Islay malt. It is youthful, reputed to me around six years of age. To me the nose is fresh (young) malt, vanilla, a hint of fruit from the sherry casks it is finished in, a very light floral note, and of course peat smoke. These are all evident on the tongue. I am curious as to where that floral note is coming from, be it yeast strain, the length of fermentation time, or the shape of the still. I simply don't know those particulars for this malt. I must say, because of that slight sherry influence, this malt makes me think of a peated version of Old Pulteney"

4.25,"Christmas and New Years came and went. Now back to the daily grind.  On this cool Friday early January evening, I pour this 2016 vintage of Machir Bay. I purchased the 2013 vintage and am curious to see this compares as I recall enjoying it.  If I am correct that was a marrying of 4 year and 5 year stock.  This 2016 is just a smidge older. 

The color is light pale gold.

A briny maritime breeze with light wisps of lemon oil provide the base of the aroma.  Salted caramel/vanilla and chocolate sweetness provide a nice counter.  There is an earthy quality with some light peat and mineral with rubber.  As it sits, slight notes of smoked spiral ham round out and fill out the nose.  Rather balanced and inviting. 

It opens on the palate medium light and silky. Smokey, oaky char, briny and white pepper spicy.  A touch of honey with an apricot or apple fruitiness.  Lemon zest works it’s way forward towards the finish. 

A drying, woody finish with lingering char and ash the hangs on for quite a length.  A spicy tingle dances for a bit a fades out leaving the ash and lemon zest. 

A solid dram that still shows its youth.  The counter play of aromas and flavors keep things balanced; vibrant.  Take your time with this one.  Somewhat akin to Caol Ila. If Kilchoman ultimately creates a 10 year vintage, I can only project that it will be one most sought after.   Thanks @Generously_Paul for the sample. [88/100][Tasted: 1/4/19]"
4.0,"Definitely islay peat, dry smoke, has kind of an ""iron"", earthy flavor.  Lighter and sweeter than I expected.  It's almost crisp.  It seems less coastal than what I expected.  It's definitely pleasant.  The sherry influence is definitely present, but it is in the background surrounded by the smoke."

I actually liked it better on the rocks than neat."

2.75,"(3 Kilchoman Evening with a dram of Machir Bay, Sanaig and Loch Gorm each.)

Nose: delicious signature Kilchoman peat, behind the very nice warm and cloudy peat there is mild exotic fruits (pineapple & star fruit), cold coffee and only a bid vanilla - still slightly sweet.

Palate: the peat receives a bid more cold ash flavor directly with the first sip - nothing off- putting though, it is slightly fruity sweet but only so much that it stays on the edge to the background, hard to grasp specific flavor profiles for me but it is delicious non the less. But there is some green banana, and burned brown sugar. Not very complex but intense with what it offers. I don’t get any parts of the sherry casks at all by the way. 

Finish: long and smokey with a metallic fruity sourness and a quite intense ABV burn like smoked birdseye chili’s. 

I like it but I prefer the sherry parts the other two Kilchomans offer - these complement the peat note in such a nice way that you really miss something with just the bourbon casks from the Machir Bay."
