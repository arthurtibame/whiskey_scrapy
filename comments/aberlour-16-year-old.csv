    Nose: Dark fruits like plums and raisins. A bit of oak and caramel. A bit of spice in the back.
    
    Taste: Dark fruits come through again, sweetness envelops. Oak spice starts to rise followed by some more spice. Almost like a cinnamon. This is not overly hot.

5.0,Feb 2017.  Glencairn glass.  Neat.  This is my first sampling over 12-year.  I’m only a dozen or so tastings into my new favorite hobby but this has become my new favorite.  The nose is warm with brown sugar and vanilla.  The mouth feel is smooth and slippery.  This seems to be where the oak comes through along with some fruity flavors and toffee.  Taste is full bodied and complex.  There is a lot more going on compared to the 12 year.  There is a spice note on the finish that pleasurably lingers a bit.  Somewhat pricey for my budget and recent penchant for repeated ‘samplings’ but I can see this being a regular staple in the secret stash.

4.0,"On the nose, not that different from the 12 year, but miles away from the Abun'ahd. More than the 12 the extra four years lends to an inarguably deeper nose but not the additional hints of sherry or tobacco that I was hoping for. On the palette the 16 delivers a richer classic Aberlour profile but not one notably better. Won't avoid it, but might lean on the 12 instead."

5.0,"Aberlour 16 is a complex, well-balanced fruit-forward whisky.  The double cask maturation process is evident on both the nose and the palate, each barrel positively contributing to the flavor profile.  The sherry influence announces itself right off the bat, as the first nosing reveals prominent notes of raisin and plumb.  Baking spices, cereal grain, oak, vanilla, almond and chocolate are also present.  On the palate there are large doses of honey and malt followed by plumb, apple and cinnamon.  The finish is long and fruity with a pleasant amount of toasted oak and a touch of anise.  Over the course of 40 minutes in the glass the breadth of fruit flavors expands to include candied orange and hints of strawberry.  The influence of the ex-bourbon barrels also becomes more pronounced.  There is a noticeable note of brown sugar and a subtle aroma of maple syrup that transfers to the palate and carries through to the finish.  The character of the oak becomes spicy and smoky with a light char.  Well worth the $65 and highly recommended. 4 1/2 stars out of 5."

3.5,"Overall this is probably closer to a 3.5 (man I wish this was a 10-point rating scale). The 16 is very light on the palate, even for the proof. Fruit is the name of the game in this sherry-forward whisky, with cherries, plums, syrupy sweetness, apple pie and raisins. Fairly short finish. Overall I appreciate the craftsmanship, though I must prefer higher proof and smokier whiskies. This is subtle throughout and there is a lot of depth in the flavor profile, when you take some time sipping the dram. But it is without that aggressive edge that I crave in most whisky. Still, this is a great starter for someone who is interested in trying scotch with greater depth and doesn't want the aggressiveness of a peated malt."

Wow, what a disappointing dram! Incredibly light on the palate (like fruit punch) with little left to taste on the watery, slightly cinnamon-heavy finish. The nose is like a cherry starburst candy, if you’re into that sort of thing. The full flavor and richer spice notes you’d expect from a 16 year old sherry-matured malt are just painfully muted throughout this stuff.

If I wanted a glass of rose I would have poured a glass of rose.

Im going to let it oxidize for a month or two, but right now give me a Glendronach 12 or, hell, even the Dalmore 12 over this bottle any day. And the $70 price point? Hard pass.

This is definitely a dessert scotch and one of the sweetest iv ever tasted - in a good way - but very very sweet none the less.

2.5,"Nose: Restrained. As it evolves sherry, raisins, vanilla, spice and honey become apparent, all very much intertwined. It's a good nose, but it remains very distant and seems diluted.

Palate: Very smooth but thin entry - it's almost like drinking water with a little honey. It develops slowly and is all about honey, fruitcake and nougat chocolate (very much like a liquid Toblerone). Unfortunately it's too watery for its own good, and lacks impact.

Finish: Short. Sweet oranges and white grapes, not much more.

Unlike Aberlour A'bunadh, which practically jumps out of the bottle at you like an alien face-hugger, this is very shy and retiring. Let it sit and open for a while or you wont get much on the nose at all, and don't add any water - it isn't needed.

I thought this was too subdued and seemed to be crying out forlornly to be bottled at 46%, at which strength it would have a lot more character. I much prefer the 12 year old double wood which is about half the price.  This expression seems as if all the difficult but interesting bits have been sanded away.

Someone who is looking for a sherried single malt that focuses entirely on easy-drinking smoothness would probably give this 3-4 stars, but for me it's no more than average quality, and excessively priced.

3.5,"Quick note before I get started. Distiller has this one listed at 43 ABV. But my bottle is only 40. In doing some research, I see that my bottle is the normal proof. Maybe it used to be 43 ABV (and it really should be).

Nose: Fruity and floral. Apricot, pear, green apple, peach, and orange. Honey and vanilla sweetness. Brown sugar and caramel from the bourbon cask. The sherry cask adds a layer of plum, fig, and a big-time raisin note. It's a nice combination of lighter and darker fruit. Heat is nonexistent. Nice nose.

Palate: Peaches and cream is the big note here. There's also a heavy dose of classic notes of honey, vanilla, caramel, and toffee. Beyond that, it's a slightly toned done version of the nose. Orange, apricot, apple, plum, raisin, and fig. A touch of leather just before the finish. Not nearly as cohesive as the nose, and also lacks of the depth. Not bad, but adds nothing substantial outside of that peaches and cream note.

Finish: Moderate in length. It's more of the same from the rest of the experience. Light fruit complimented by dark fruit, rounded off with vanilla and honey. A nice touch of oak and the faintest trace of cinnamon stays with you until this one cuts out.

I was compelled to buy this when the price dropped from $90 to $65. At the former rate, this is a marginal value. However, at $65, it's worth every penny. Of course, I'd love to see what a slight bump in ABV could do for this one. Sure, Aberlour going for subtle and pleasant, and they hit their mark. But I think that a bump to 43 ABV would bolster what is a relatively shallow palate.

Perfect if you're in the mood for something easy-going and approachable, but just complex enough to distinguish itself from the herd. I've come to love in-your-face Islay and cask strength bourbons, but I can still appreciate a subtle, friendly Speysider every now and again. This is exactly that. If you see it for around $65 and are in the mood for a date that's easier than she is interesting, I'd say pull the trigger without hesitation.

5 months later and I've put this through some comparisons. Decided to drop to a 3.5. 40% ABV really hurts this one. I think this would be a stellar malt at 43-46%. Still enjoying it otherwise."

I can’t comment on details because I had it with dinner and not really a true tasting. I was in the middle for me of the three, right behind the three wood but I definitely plan on having a bottle in my collection."

Avent 2019 - 3/24.
Après avoir dégusté ce whisky au Château Frontenac il y a un an, je me disais que l'expérience en calendrier de l'avent allait être délicieuse. Et bien, je suis heureux de constater que j'aime toujours passionnément ce scotch. Ce nectar coule comme une rivière fougueuse au coeur d'une vallée majestueuse. Miam miam!"
3.5,"Quite nice.

There's a creamy nuttiness on the nose, with hints of dried fruit when you get in close.

The pallate is sweet, but not caramel.  Fruits, raisins, plums.

It finishes with a lingering heart, and subtle spiciness."

2.0,"My experience tasting the Aberlour 16 was akin to putting my ear to a wall and attempting to listen to music being played in the next room at a very modest volume.  

Do critics at Rolling Stone or Pitchfork review albums experienced through one ear stuck to a wall?  No, they do not.  I'll use that as an excuse to be somewhat brief here. 

There are some very mild but not unpleasant notes of malt and fruit.  But overall, I found the dram to be so muted that the primary characteristics were a thinness, a lack of depth, and nothing that remotely captured my interest.  

This was my first Aberlour, but I'm not yet deterred.  I have a sample of Casg Annamh on order that I suspect will prove to be more of a heavy hitter.  If not, the A'Bunadh will be next."

3.5,"The nose is vinous red wine, blood oranges, raisins, and graham crackers.  Perhaps the most inviting of sherried drams I've nosed.  Plums and oranges, raisins, on the palate, with an underlying oak nuttiness, developing into a finish of baking spices. The expert review of this is spot on.  Gentle, and surprisingly warming. 

There were some inconsistencies in the palate. More than once, I was left with the impression of apple juice.  Which is fine by me.  Another time, the finish reminded me of fruit punch! (But this is an indication of the low ABV, instead of real maturation character.)  

With a name like Aberlour and the age statement, I thought this would bowl me over like Aaron Donald rushing the line of scrimmage.  While this would work well as an accompaniment to a red meat dish, on it's own there's room for improvement.  For the price point, I'd pick the Glendronach 15 over this.
