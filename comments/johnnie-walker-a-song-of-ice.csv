Light and crisp, floral, more like a Speyside and don't really care for it."

4.25,Beautiful nose of vanilla. So silky on the mouth and beautiful sweet fruit. Pineapple and mango notes on the finish.

4.0,"Very light and floral. Good vanilla undertones. Unusual for a scotch, no smoke. But of the game of thrones editions this is the best"

1.5,Light floral notes. Not very flavorful. Only good for boozing up drinks because you won’t taste a thing
3.0,"Had my first glass with a large ice cube since Johnnie Walker recommends serving it cold (in my experience, that means there will be a lot of the grain whisky burn). Nose is grassy and clean, just like the bottle says. Not as syrupy on the palate as the White Walker. Loads of vanilla overwhelm a hint of fruit and as it gets colder and diluted, it almost loses any distinguishable taste. Clean finish. I bought it for the marketing gimmick."

2.0,Spicy but no other flavor. Don’t like it. Won’t pick up again even if it is a very good price.

2.75,"Pretty middle of the road as scotch blends go. Light and a bit sweet, kind of buttery, sugary cereal and birch wood. The scent is light and mostly blonde wood and grass, and the finish is a bit sharp with tingly warmth and corn syrup. Ice helps - it simplifies things, and makes it more quaffable."

3.25,"Decent flavor, but mild and a little thin.  I bought it on clearance at half retail price, but it isn't memorable enough to buy again, even on clearance."

3.5,"Much like actual fire and ice, this is the complete opposite of the song of fire edition. This is meant to be served chilled and the result is a smooth, floral Scotch that is not complex, but goes down like water with no burn. Probably the most refreshing whiskey there is"

3.25,"The nose of the scotch is sweet with hints of butter and brown sugar.

On the tongue it is sweet with slightly fruity notes.  There is a spice, and bit of a brine in the finish.  It is good, but not great.  An inoffensive scotch that would make a good introduction to the genre."

3.25,"Fruity and sweet at the nose, with hints of fresh herbs. In the palate, the tropical fruits, herbiness and sweetness remains, as well as an aptly désignés freshness. Not overly complex, but still and interesting dram, especially for people not enjoying the peaty or smoky whiskies."

3.5,Light spicy and sweet notes. Butterscotch tones on the palate.
3.5,Very light fruit smell. First taste of strong butterscotch and honey. Quick finish that does not linger.
