4.25,"One of the best ways to judge a Whiskey is to compare it against another fine Whiskey to assess how good the dram really is... Rather than just review this Whiskey below is a comparison against the fantastic Blood Oath Pact 6...

This was a really interesting and thought showdown to judge! Before we dive into the review and results, let's take a look at the make up of each Bourbon:

Blood Oath Pact 6:

Source: Kentucky Distillery Undisclosed (Rumor is Heaven Hill)
Age: 14 yr, 9yr and 7yr finished in Cognac Cask
Filtration: Unfiltered
Proof: 98.6

Joseph Magnus Barrel #1149 (Century Grand Pick)

Source: MGP
Age: 13yr finished in Cognac Cask
Filtration: Unfiltered
Proof: 98.2 (Cask Strength)

Let's dive in...

Blood Oath Pact 6:

Entry is silky with vanilla, caramel, orange peel, clove and oak. Mid palate is where the Cognac influence appears with juicy grapes, French oak (like a well aged Cognac) and dark chocolate. Finish is a medium length with more oak, pepper and butterscotch. That French oak note returns and lingers

Magnus:

Entry is very rich and robust for the proof! Mature oak, rich vanilla, leather and cigar box on the palate. In the background there is a fruitiness that's really pleasant, apples and grapes predominantly. Baking spices are very evident on the mid palate thru the long finish. Add in more oak, toffee and cinnamon. The finish is classic MGP that tales off and leaves the French Oak ok the tongue. 

Verdict:

Both are excellent Bourbons and once again your preference will determine which you would prefer. Fans of well aged MGP Bourbon I think would prefer the lovely twist this Magnus Barrel adds. Folks who prefer less spice forward Bourbon with more cask influence will prefer the Blood Oath Pact 6. For me if I could only have 1 it would be the Magnus."
