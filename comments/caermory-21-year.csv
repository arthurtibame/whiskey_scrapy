3.5,A distillery with more lives than a cat and a resurrection and brand funded by government tax relief.  There is a story in every dram! The Tobermory distillery has opened and closed a number of times. In 1992 3 investors realized they could reopen it produce a bunch of whiskey and a year later sell it for a handsome tax free profit courtesy of BES a govt scheme to ensure equity was available for small businesses. So their efforts and this brand is responsible for the Tobermory and Ledaig drams loved by many today. Anyhow less history more drinking. This is a simple damn but quite nice.  Lovely sweet vanilla and that's it but its a note it hits well.
