2.0,"Very vibrant, fruity nose. Smooth on the palate, with herbal and floral notes. Maybe some dough if you tilt your head a bit. Finishes slightly bitter.  5/28/18"

4.0,"Unlike some others reviewers I really and truly enjoyed this one. It was different than many other rye whiskeys and was one of the most crisp and refreshing I have had to date. It is nice to have at least one whiskey that is light on the palate.
N- sweet, citrus, vanilla, young 
P- rye spice, apple, pepper 
F- short, clean, crisp (like white wine)"
3.25,"The nose is soft with floral rye spiciness with notes of buttery vanilla and oak, while the younger aspect of the blend presents some raw herbal notes. The palate is very subtle and opens up with oak and vanilla with the rye trailing behind it, with the youth again showing itself coming in at the end with a sharp earth spiciness. The finish is medium with a lingering floral rye spiciness with a raw spiciness sticking to the mouth. Overall it’s too subtle in all aspects and the blend of aged and young whiskey seems to be at a bit of a conflict."

3.5,"Color more red compared to 001.

Nose: sweet, bubblegum, vanilla

Taste: sweeter and smoother than 001, initially didn't get the herbal times until I let it sit in my mouth and run of the sides of the tongue. Similar finish in that it lasts and makes me salivate."

3.25,Moderately sweet with plenty of rye spice that one could easily confuse with ABV but it does mellow out a bit after letting rest. Overall a good pour but their 10 year rye blows this one out of the water any day of the week.
