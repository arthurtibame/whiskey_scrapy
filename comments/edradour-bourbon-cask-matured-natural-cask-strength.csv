5.0,"Nose is rum raisins, chocolate cherry cordials, blood oranges, hazelnuts, apple tarts, and slight cappuccino lightening mildly as it transitions into more citrus-forward notes on the palate, with sherry sweetness, fruitcake, dried leaves, and mild sultanas hiding deep underneath the rich palate. Finish is long and slightly bitter, with figs, raisins, and faint tobacco leaf presiding.

Very similar to Aberlour A'Bunadh, but manages to be a sherry bomb without as big a sherry sweetness, and not as much heat for only being bottled at a slightly lower proof (A'Bunadh is at 120). A'Bunadh as I recall had a bit more solvent-character and papaya and honey on the finish, along with a bit of peppery-ness which are absent in the Edradour.

Stellar in every respect."

5.0,"Add as much or as little water as you want to this 59.2% ABV beauty. Water doesn't hurt it. Sweet and complex. Nose, mouth and finish wonderful. If you want an amazing whisky that's unpeated and non-sherried, give this a try."

3.0,"If you're ever in one of those Neo/Morpheus moments, with the bottle on your left being the Bourbon Cask Strength and the one on your right being the Sherry, pick this one. It's delicious! 

Admittedly the nose is one-dimensional, though someone with an X-Men mutation may encounter barley and yeast. It's basically floral. In your mouth you come across grapefruit and hazelnut – it's very good but not great. As for the finish… Picture a virgin on his honeymoon."
4.0,"Predominantly citric on the nose, with some chocolate milk, baking spices and faint floral notes emerging before the first sip. The mouthful is full bodied, with oranges, nutmeg, and fresh oak on the palate. The finish is of medium length with a slightly mentholated aftertaste. Good whisky overall."
