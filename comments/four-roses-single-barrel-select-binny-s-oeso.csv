4.25,"Taste:  2 oz, neat in Glen Cairn.

Nose: (4.5) Full of caramel, and concord grape jam.  It is sweet, rich, and full of sweet stewed fruits.

Palate:  (4.5)  Grapes, apples, vanilla, and chewy taffy.  There is a sweetness about it but not overdone.  The mouthfeel is thick and coating.

Finish:  (4.25) Finishes for days.  The grape jam precludes an almost fig-newton type aftertaste.  There is a bit of oak that comes in that lets you know this has some age to it.

Overall:  This is a great pick!  Apparently 11 yrs., 6mos is the perfect time to rest a delicious single barrel OESO.  I cant wait to try the other Binny's select picked barrel recipes I got on this release.  OBSQ is my next bottle to open once this one is gone.  Can't wait to do a side by side comparison and then pick one after sampling blind."
