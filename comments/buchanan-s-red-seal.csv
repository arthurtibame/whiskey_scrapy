3.0,"Nose: campfire, spicy, slight peat. Smells sweet and caramel with ice.
Palate: heavy, spicy, high alcohol, bitter. Slightly smoky and peaty. A bit smoother and more pleasant with ice."

4.75,"Very impressively balanced.  Predominantly an expression of sweet Highland whiskys, but the smoke of the Islay is present and an extremely nice compliment.  Won't comment on the price, but a very, very well made whisky.  A hint of salt and brine.  Extremely smooth."

2.0,"On the nose, malt and cologne, it's pleasant. Smooth on the palate. Slight milk chocolate. Floral, a hint of peat, and shortbread. This is a gentleman's malt. 7/19/19"

5.0,"BEST WHISKY OF THE YEAR and best whisky so far. Look, im not exagerating, i have found a perfect 10. even better than Chivas Royal Salute 21 and Johnnie Walker Xr, this is my top blended scotch whisky of 2016.

i have never had it before and today a friend gave me 3 glasses.

It is a perfect 10, Perfectly Balanced, long Finish, full bodied, very complex.


Let me tell you something. If i have to pick over Chivas, Old Parr, Johnnie Walker or Buchanan's (top 4 brands sold in Ecuador where i live) i will always pick Buchanan's in any of its variants.

On the nose has a beatiful peaty note, no other Buchanan's has it. Perfumed as most 21 year old Whiskies (it could be older or younger since it doesn't have an age statement), you can also find Hazelnut and coffee notes. But peat takes it all in. 

YES A BUCHANANS WITH PEAT !

On the palate is where the real magic happens. Full bodied, as it enters your mouth you will instantly feel very very very old oak, caramel, almonds, a lot of toffee and it will chance into a spicy red chilli, with a easy bearing hotness. The finish is beautiful, long lasting: it touches your stomach and comes back as a hot/spicy wooden note that makes you go ""ahhhhh"" (like the Coca Cola Propaganda). 

I truly believe this is the best whisky i have had so far and i will grant it the title of 2016 whisky of the year for me. LOVELY DRAM. it goes for 150 dollars on a duty free, you are now compelled to get your hands on it. WONDERFUL"
4.75,"Generally I am not a Scotch guy so that prefaces my Scotch reviews. Nose on this is ever so slightly smokey, but not overpowering the light butterscotch notes. First sip plays on the smoke, but it mellows quickly and subsequent tastes are less smoke forward.  Hints of butter toffee and smoked nuts come to mind while a gentle burn warms your insides. Finish is long, but suttle with more honey almond notes. This is a wonderfully smooth Scotch and as mentioned to start I am generally not a Scotch guy, but for very good Scotch I believe I will make exceptions."
5.0,"Simply the smoothest whiskey I’ve ever had. Buttery, sweet, velvety. It’s a wonderful blend!"
