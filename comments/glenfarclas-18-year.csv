4.0,My first scotch. The bottle grew on me over time. It had strong sherry flavors and was sweet and smooth. I enjoyed the oily character that coated my tongue.

3.0,"Nose - Apple, honey, ginger, orange zest, syrupy riesling.

Taste - Dark honey, woody barrel aged apple cider, ginger spice, white pepper heat, hint of orange zest with light pith bitterness, lightly fruity peach/strawberry, bitter nut skins.

Finish - Lingering nutty sweetness, hint of medicinal/metallic bitter, light metallic apple/grape juice.

Score - 79/100

Final Thoughts - I guess I'm not all that impressed with the ""younger"" Glenfarclas line. The 17 is very similar to the 18 and both are kind of lackluster in overall nose & taste. The 18 has a nice pleasant dark honey sweet initially but it somehow transitions into this weird metallic taste that lingers to the finish.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.5,"Where to start? Lots of thoughts. I enjoy the young GFs especially at the price point. And I had tastes of the 17 and 21 and enjoyed both. So when I saw the opportunity to snag 1L of this for $70 it was an obvious buy. I really wanted to like this. So much so that taste after mildly disappointing taste I’d hold off on reviewing this, hoping it was the pour, or my mood, or just something about the state of my taste buds that was off and the next time I’d get what I’d come to expect from glenfarclas. Well I just poured my last dram, and 1L later I’m still at that point of “meh”. Time to move on i guess. But not before reviewing it. 

The nose Is subtle. The honey is there. Light floral notes. Sweet and light fruits. A little sulfur but overall not unpleasant. 

It’s very thin. I wasn’t expecting a meaty mouthfeel but for 18 years you’d think you’d get a little more texture. The sherry is also muted. Considering the age this surprised me...Wonder how many refills this cask has seen. It’s got a little heat to it, the spice shows up but not in a really welcome way. I enjoy spice from time to time but this was like a drive-by intrusion, and not even a violent one. An egging? It comes on in a quick burst then disappears. The finish isn’t long or short. Which shouldn’t take away any points but what does linger unfortunately is the sulfur. Leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. 

Overall I am probably being too harsh. Of the approximately 10-12 drams I’ve had of this liter perhaps this is the worst. But then again I may have said that several times. I wouldn’t buy this again. I’d rather have the 10 or 12 even though this doesn’t cost much more than those."
2.25,"Very aromatic and full on the nose right from a fresh pour. Fresh orchard fruit, blackberry, sour kiwi, marzipan, apple peel. Then some ginger, bitter & sour grapefruit, fresh ground black pepper, a bid of pumpkin spice and saw dust. Finally old sherry cask aromas. 

The taste is surprisingly sharp with a hot pepper burn. Underlying are the fruity notes, some dark honey, also some vanilla and a distinct floral wood taste with a mild bitterness. It becomes much sweeter (creamy fudge) after a few sips but the burn stays and is really surprising for its 43 ABV."

3.75,"Full gold in the glass.
The nose is caressed by the alcoholic cherry with the classic Mon Cheri effect, with a vinous background reminiscent of certain delicate grappas. Wood together with vanilla and a drop of honey. Sweet but not ruffle.
Sherry becomes much more evident in the mouth, a warm and enveloping aroma that flows on the palate as if it were stronger than its 43 alcoholic degrees. Red fruit, herbaceous hints and spices are grafted onto the wood, which at times is a little intrusive, as well as alcohol which in the long run sweeps too far, brushing off the initial effect.
The finish is medium, of wood and raisins with a certain astringency,"

4.0,"Nov 2019.
Clear medium gold.
Tasted by small tulip glass.
Aromatic woody incense, forest, humus and natural cedar wood in nose.
Medium body with lots of logs, dried wood, fresh made incense, and a little vanilla and sweet spicy in palate.
Classic ex bourbon aged flavor with clean and smooth finish.
Like a textbook of well ex bourbon cask aged single malt scotch. Right at it's peak of maturation."

3.75,"Olfato: adocicado, frutado de frutos vermelhos, mel, cítrico, amadeirado,frutos vermelhos e um pouco de baunilha (talvez). Possui as típicas notas de vinho Jerez mas não muito intensas, provavelmente os barris utilizados na maturação eram de segundo uso . Nenhuma presença de álcool.

Paladar: apimentado e um pouco de amargor, dulçor, amadeirado, cítrico e um pouco de frutos vermelhos. Sua boca seca por alguns instantes mas o sabor do whisky vem à tona com a saliva conforme os segundos passam. Média oleosidade.

Finish: média para curta, com boa presença do amargor.

Impressões gerais: não complexo mas bem balanceado. As vezes este whisky passa a impressão de ser mais jovem, mas mesmo assim é bem saboroso e possui um bom arredondamento. Ótimo custo x beneficio."
