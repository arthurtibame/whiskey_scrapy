3.5,Aged in red wine barrels
4.0,Super smooth
3.5,"Has a pretty bold cask wine finish.  It definitely is unexpected.  Once you wrap your head and taste buds around it, it’s a really nice sipper."
3.75,A unique bourbon with a tannic like finish. Noses for a slightly carmel and tannic wine. Overall a decent sipping whiskey for cheap.
