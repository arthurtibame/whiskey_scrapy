3.0,Syrupy. Smells like roasted peanut. Sweet but leaves a slightly harsh aftertaste. Best Bushmills I've had

5.0,"An exclusive malt from Bushmills that can only be purchased directly from the distillery.   They are very proud of this reserve and so they should be. Having tasted a free glass on the Bushmills distillery tour I was eager to purchase a bottle. You are greeted with a very smooth and full taste, hints honey and marmalade which rests into a easy warm note. You want the best whiskey from the Irish? Look no further. Excellent!"

The 12 years when you do the tour
After the tour of the distillery, we are entitled to a free 12-year tasting, a product sold only at the distillery. It is a good whisky, nothing very special, but a must when you visit the distillery."

3.75,"A great experience if a bit harsh on the finish. The nose is sweet with hints of chocolate and red fruits, the taste is rich and will give hints of honey sweet. The finish sadly won't last very long and might be a bit hard for beginners."

3.25,Good but too alcohol-y like Irish whisky is. You can def taste the triple distilledness. Not a fan

4.0,"[Reader Beware! Lots of golf stuff.]

Back in September of 2016, we had a magical golf trip to the north coast of Ireland. Betwixt and between, we took time to visit the Giant’s Causeway (geological wonder) and Old Bushmills Distillery for a tour and tasting of this “distillery only” single malt whiskey. For the benefit of golfers contemplating a trip to Great Britain or Ireland, this itinerary rates high on the list of “best golf destinations.” It’s impossible to describe the inherent beauty of these links courses all situated along the rugged and sandy north coast. We flew into Dublin and drove northwest to Letterkenny passing one picture-postcard farmhouse after another. The pristine landscape was spectacular and almost surreal in the perfect placement of things. We played 5 rounds in the Republic of Ireland starting at Narin & Portnoo, and moved clockwise to play two courses at Rosapenna (Old Tom Morris & Sandy Hills), and both at Ballyliffin (Old & Glashedy, 2018 Irish Open). We then traveled across the invisible border to Northern Ireland (UK) to play Portstewart (2017 Irish Open), Castlerock, two rounds at Royal Portrush (2019 British Open), and, lastly, Ardglass, as a consolation for not getting on the world’s top rated golf course of Royal County Down, next door and just south of Belfast. Had we stayed a 3rd week we could have played, but Ardglass mollified our disappointment with its picturesque, canon fortified clubhouse dating back to 1405 and majestic, ocean views layout. Diageo acquired Bushmills back in 2005, then traded it in 2014 to Jose Cuervo in exchange for the remaining share of Don Julio Tequila it did not already own. At the time of the tour, they quoted production output of 11 million liters; however, most of this coming from bottling services provided other distilleries, primarily Jameson. Bushmills’ own production has been static in recent years at roughly 4.5 million liters, but still significant. The bottling operation was the antithesis of Springbank’s where each bottle is labeled and inspected by hand. Here, production is fully mechanized and cases drop onto pallets six at a time. Our taste of the Distillery Reserve was memorable. Aged in both Oloroso Sherry and bourbon for 12 years, it is bottled at 40% ABV and sits in the glass looking medium amber and rich. The nose makes a great first impression and the palate was both dry and smooth with a near perfect blend of fruits, nuts and spices. The friendly ABV and soothing finish made it enjoyable by all. Would I make the long trek back to the distillery for another glass? Unequivocally.....yes! This year’s golf trip covers the southwest coast of Ireland my wife and I toured back in 2002. I’m really looking forward to it……as you can tell. :)"
