4.0,Nose: Apples and caramel. Taste: Not much to say; very simple and very sweet with hints of fruit. I'm a little surprised by how much I enjoy this whiskey. Exceptional everyday whiskey for the price.

1.0,"The green label is appropriate because I would describe this bourbon as green - not much age, grassy notes, and not much of the flavor I'm looking for in a bourbon - too much sour/tartness with the sweetness . I haven't mixed with it yet, but seems thin. I've heard others describe this green label as smooth, but for an 80-proof bourbon, I don't think it's particularly smooth - just thin.
In a budget 80-proof, I will stick with Benchmark, which has the flavors I'm looking for (caramel, vanilla, tobacco, leather) and I find to be much smoother. While Benchmark isn't in the Distiller database, I would give it 3 stars compared to the 1 I'm giving Evan Williams Green label."

1.0,"This is a really pretty terrible bourbon.  At under $10 a bottle you can't expect much, but I think one could reasonably expect more than this.  ""Green"" is very appropriate as the finish reminds me of green, or under-matured wine.  Yeasty and off-putting.  It's worth the extra buck to upgrade to the Evan Williams black label, which is more likely what you were hoping for when you made the mistake of buying the green."

1.0,"Worst bourbon I've ever had. Sour, funky oak on entry and finish. I know it's about $10, but for that price or less, you can get Henry McKenna or Heaven Hills Old Style (both from the same distillery) and get a much better pour."

4.0,Sweet Vanilla & a nice Low Cost Bourbon which is very good for entry level drinkers that want a smooth simple Bourbon that is good for just about anything!

3.0,"A little harsh, but not any harsher than the white label Evan Williams.  I think I prefer the black label out of all three of these, though.  There are some hints of vanilla and caramel, but not much of either.

I paid $15.99 for a 1.75 liter bottle, so an okay bottle to keep around the bar."

3.0,"Tried this for the first time tonight. Honestly, it’s very similar to the basic Jack Daniels whiskey; it has a powerful scent of bananas and sugar. The palate is much more sweet than Jack, which isn’t too bad if you’re mixing it. Overall, not too tragic, it’s definitely better than Early Times. It’s pretty average and definitely works for basic mixed drinks. I’d give it around a 5.5/10. there’s much better, and there’s also much worse."
null,"As a long time fan of EW, I use the Green for cooking with great success. Black or White for every day sipping and single barrel for special occasions. The same mixture of grains in all so EW does a superb job of bottling the various tastes and aging and alcohol."
4.0,"I tried this at a open bar because they didn’t have anything else it was ok not great so I will give it 2.5 stars, but after realizing the low price I have to change it to 3.5 . For the price this bourbon is very good. Some sour notes make it a little different but not in a bad way and the light sweetness comes in after that to balance it. I wouldn’t buy it for my home bar but would recommend 1.75L bottle to share with friends on a camping trip around the fire. 
P.S after trying this in 2018, I bought the single barrel vintage year 2010
 it is definitely great value pick for the home bar"

2.0,"Nose:  sweet, mildly fruity, a little bit of oak spice, a faint deet smell
Palate:  a hint of bananas, sweet
Finish:  short, spicy, some lingering sweetness 
You really have to search to get much aroma from this one.  The taste is fleeting and not complex at all.  There just isn’t much to it.  Nothing about it is offensive but it’s not that interesting either.  It’s cheap, but so is the black label from the same brand, and while it’s not outstanding either it is more interesting and enjoyable."

Simple. Vanilla, with floral notes. A bit of butterscotch. Great in a whiskey sour, not the best sipper."

3.0,"For a bargain barrel bourbon this really isn't bad.  It doesn't need water or ice as its only 80 proof. 

At around twice the price and still under $30 you should probably give Evan Williams Single Barrel a look. It's markedly more complex than both the green and black labels."

2.5,"The nose is simple with oak, vanilla, caramel, green fruits and some honey. These carry over into the palate in a very soft and gentle fashion, but the finish is very quick which sees these flavors all balanced, but fade quickly."
