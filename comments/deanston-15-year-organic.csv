3.0,"Good Whisky, the organic version gives a very light coulour. 
Crispy, light vanilla (bourbon barrel) and Christmas cake tastes.
Not smoky at all for a sweet finish."

3.5,"Creamy and malty on the nose, with more of the same plus lemons in the mouth. Reminds me of a classic Bruichladdich - nothing too complicated, just tasty and satisfying. @SolanaRoots are you sure this is virgin oak? There’s none of the excessive oak spice that I associate with new barrels."

3.5,"It’s fresh, piney, “organic”. What I consider to be a “Scotchy-scotch” in true Highlands style, which generally isn’t my personal preference. 

But this is quality, so I like it. Not something I’ll drink regularly but it fills a gap in the collection."
