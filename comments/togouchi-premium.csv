3.25,"Togouchi Blended Whisky is not an actual Japanese Whisky, it is entirely made of scottish whisky, and just bottled in Japan.

Bottled at 40%abv its the most transparent Whisky i have ever seen, with a Gin Clear color. 

On the nose it is very dim, you have to let it sit for quite a while. After 10 minutes, notes will appear: plum, slight peatyness, alcohol, vanilla cookie, pepper and chocolate powder.

On the palate its actually not bad, a little bitter, with cereal, pepper, ashes and dry brown grasses. Finish is short and body is medium. 

Overall it is a 69 out of 10, maybe suitable for cocktails."

4.0,"Another japanese Whisky, this time one I enjoy. The nose is red apples with honey, some vanilla, and a bit of cereals. Taste is slightly sweet, honey, butter biscuits and cereals. Aftertaste is of medium length and very buttery. No smoke or anything like that in this whisky, it's rather nice and friendly. Bur for the price it's definatly worth a shot."

3.5,"Quite surprising whisky. This is my first Japanese tasting.
Very light and pale colour (is it really matured in a sherry cask????).
At the nose from the bottle, one can smell violet and alcohol. And also very light (hidden)smells of fresh citrus fruits and apples. Vanilla and oak smells are also a bit present but easier to catch.
Pouring it into a glass makes this smell vanish a bit.
At the fist taste it is very spicy and peppery and an incredibly round and oily (creamy even) sensation take on your tongue which is a good and interesting contrast with the first flavours.
Later the whisky gets less spicy and easier to drink. At this stage one can taste apple and fruity taste.
Adding water drops helps it to get even less spicy but also less creamy (which is a shame). We can taste the violet syrup at this time along with light cacao.

I don't usually drink blended whisky (it might be only my third or fourth one), and as I said it is the first Japanese. But this was a very nice experience and I'd be happy to do it again. If you can try it, don't hesitate!"

4.0,"Ignore the haters: this is pretty good stuff. 

Floral nose, like perfume, with perhaps the faintest of peat. Palate has some coconut, some oak, ever so slight seaweed, and a smoked fish quality to the finish. 

It's complex and good."
