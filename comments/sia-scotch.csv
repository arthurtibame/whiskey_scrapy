3.75,"Mild on nose, pale golden hue in color. Nose has hints of orange peel. A sip Starts off with honey followed by fruity pear honeysuckle with a mild burn at the end and a flat finish and no peat"
3.25,Sweet citrus on the nose with vanilla. The taste is mild with more smoke than expected. Finish is medium in length with grain notes and a touch of spice.

2.0,Very simple straight forward dram. Very one note on the nose creamy cereal grain and light sherry. Palate is creamy barley and one note Speyside sherry that swells and fades quickly  into a very mild Highland honeysuckle and salty? blend of Speyside Highland and Islay. A good beginner whisky.
4.0,"Initial aroma is loaded with vanilla and caramel. Very faint whisper of smoke. A touch of water opens that up, but ice dulls it.
Tasted neat, it is very well balanced. Light in body, and a very smooth, creamy finish. Adding water doesn't change it much, but one square of ice highlighted the smoke and brine. The smoke builds as I get closer to the end of the glass, but never gets intense. Nice easy drinking whisky."
