4.5,"Strangely enough, Bunnahabhain core expressions haven't impressed me as much as their cask finishes and special bottlings. The Bunnahabhain Moine is an amazing peaty, yet winey dram that scores greatly in the most important criteria: deliciousness. 

Bottled at 46.3%abv, it has a pale gold color. 

On the nose: As soon as you open the bottle, you get this beautiful perfumed peat. Milk chocolate, very very Winey, very Grapey. Heathery peat, thick vanilla. Very sweet with puffs of smoke. Amazing. 

On the palate, it is a little straightforward, but delicious. First you get this winey sensation infused with pepper. Grapes, Vanilla, marshmallows.

It has a very rewarding aftertaste. Medium long, with this grapey / peppery overall finish. 

Overall this whisky is very balanced, very sweet, with a winey profile that stands over the mild peatiness that this dram offers you. My score for it is a solid, well deserved 92 over 100."

3.75,Pulling this rating up a bit from its ludicrous low. It’s a good young peaty scotch. Heat and phenols linger for awhile. Very salty and earthy on the nose and palate. I’d been jonesing for some peat and this most certainly scratched that itch. Enjoyed neat. Will try a splash of water to see what happens.
0.75,"Ok I ordered a bunch of heavily smoked single malts to experience this end of the spectrum as well. And an experience it was. But I quickly realized this grade of peat is not for me. 

It comes with a heavy smoked-and-salted-meat aroma, like a very dark Spanish bacon chunk. And while I can understands that this is something people are liking and looking for, it is just too much for my taste. It is intense and overwhelming while it is generally soft on the tongue. 

I probably will wait a couple of years to give it another go after I broadened my spectrum further."
3.0,"Extraordinarily fluid texture (neither smooth nor evaporating, but somehow slick) with a rich set of tastes which are warm, becoming very peaty indeed. Definitely not a subtle dram, this one."
