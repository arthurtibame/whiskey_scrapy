4.0,"Gobs of slightly salty, melted butter on popcorn on the nose. Tastes of honey, strong with alcohol, a bit of water gives it a buttery mouthfeel.  Very unique especially from an Islay. I love it and recommend it for anyone wanting to try something different in an affordable single malt Scotch."

4.0,"[UPDATE:  I was going to rate this a 3 when I started my review, but as I worked through it, and started taking notes and typing, the whisky changed quite a bit in the glass.  What was fairly mute and unexpressive opened a lot, and the flavors grew more bold.  Definitely recommend letting this sit uncovered in the glass for at least 10 minutes]  The nose is fairly light, with a bit of saltspray, honeysuckle, and the faintest whiff of citrus, more lemony than grapefruit, but certainly a mashup rather than just one or the other.  Maybe not awe-inspiring, but certainly unique.  The palate is almost a flavor-for-scent copy of the nose, but underlying it all is an essence of outdoorsiness.  Think of eating a grapefruit while sitting on a clean linen in the middle of a freshly harvested hayfield, with the wind blowing the soft vanilla/sugar aromas of honeysuckle past you.  Not very complex, but pleasant and enjoyable nonetheless.  The finish is all too brief, because this is the best part of the dram for me.  It gets heavy, oily, and redolent with lemon and eucalyptus flavor...if they could find a way to carry this flavor throughout the whole experience, it would be a 5-star Scotch.  As it is, it's mostly the finish that keeps it from sinking to a 3.

I'm beginning to worry that Bruichladdich just isn't my cup of tea.  This makes me sad, because I absolutely love the peated expressions from Port Charlotte, and Octomore is my second favorite drink of all time.  I don't know for sure, but I'm committed to finding out."
4.0,"On the nose, smoke and toffee. A dram greets you with salted caramel, a touch of vanilla and oak with a hint of orange essence. Finish is long strong and assertive with smoke and oak. This is some good stuff!"

4.0,Love this. Great to see a large distillery focus so much on the grains being used and allowing the natural malt flavor to be the star here. Extremely well executed.
4.0,"I have definitely fallen in love with coastals like Old Pulteney and Bruichladdich. This offering has a nice vanilla cereal on the nose, with a spritz of fresh sea salt. The pallette follows suit, with the trademark brine but a little more muted than the Classic Laddie. Some sharpness in the finish from the young age and 50% abv. Overall very pleasant and when had side by side with the Classic Laddie, I prefer the Islay Barley 2009."

4.0,The nose starts with some honey and sea spray and a very light something - almost cherry wood? Starts smooth and a little buttery  with a hint of sweetness before showing its youth. A lemon pepper kick follows with saltiness and light smoke.
4.0,"I am not a huge fan of Bruichladdich.  In fact, if there were a small meteor headed for Islay and I had the godlike power to choose which distillery would take the hit, it'd probably be these guys (sorry!  I just love my peaty scotches too much).  With that being said, this unpeated line of whiskies, put out under the distillery's own name, isn't half-bad.  Bruichladdich is leading the charge in the so-called ""terroir""movement, as a recent article on Distiller highlights.  Here's what one-of-a-kind Islay-ness produces:  a strong nose of apple cider and scents similar to rose wine, including a little zest and cotton candy.  On the palate, there are loads of classic scotch honey, grapefruit and more apple, and a mixture of waxy, spicy, and nutty characteristics that is quite an overload of flavors.  It's a bit discordant, but also complex.  The finish is spicy and a tiny bit bitter, and is where the whisky's youth reveals itself."

4.0,"$45 with Tax, another Virginia ABC Closeout Gem! Non-chill filtered, 50% ABV and no coloring added, this one is growing on me. It is young, only 6 years old but once its tamed with a little time in the glass and a bit a water there is a ton going on in this malt. Sweet, spicy... is Salted Smoked Toffee a flavor? Excited to see what its like when I get towards the bottom."

4.0,"Age: 6 years
Distilled 2009.  Bottled 2015.
Alcohol: 50%
Paid: $60

$60 for a 6 year old unpeated Scotch?  It takes some kind of confidence to not go the NAS route.  Its contents must be good.  And it is.

Imagine the greatest pizza you have ever tasted.  It better have good dough.  That dough is so good, maybe you wonder how the dough would taste on its own.  Well, if that pizza is Octomore 6.3, then this is its dough, pure and unpeated.

This whisky has a simple idea, and it delivers on that idea.  The highlight here is the malt, proudly grown on Islay.  They name the farmer and the farm, as a way to show that this product has been cared for by Bruichladdich from the soil to the bottle.  What you get in the dram is maltiness at its best: creamy oatmeal, butter and cereal.  This is the best of the Octomores, stripped of its armor of peat; revealing the delicate and decadent body behind the monster.  If only it was cask strength!

MARK: 89/100.
Recommended purchase!"

3.0,"Sampling: Islay Barley 2010

Bruichladdich Islay Barley is unexpected to say the least and it draws on great complexity, given the time it needs to arrive at its “full potential.”

This dram needs room to breathe. Failing to provide it space results in both you and the scotch never seeing the whole picture. Initially, I detected honey and not much else. The nose was a tad abrasive, acidic and carrying some notes of acetone.
However, that eventually opened up into numerous other notes such as rich cream, vanilla, butterscotch, dried maple leaves, caramel soft candies, brown sugar, and molasses. First impressions are really important and while this one did eventually win me over, the nose didn’t get me all that excited until minutes after pouring.

On the tongue, a medium mouthfeel displaying toasted cereal grains, oatmeal, and some incredibly sweet elements with playful candor. Islay Barley might be dessert in a glass for some, but does succeed in balancing the whole package with daring heat.

The exit lingers for a bit, then gives up the ghost within 30 seconds or so. Residual heat stays in the chest a few seconds after the dram has left your mouth, leaving a more oily finish.

Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2010 is worth the time and money if you can find it. Frankly, you can find better options by Bruichladdich if you’re looking for a crowd pleaser (Classic Laddie). But, if you prefer a nice slow dance with your dram, this one might be calling your number.

4.0,"So, I recently was astounded by the laddie. There was something just so clean, pure, balanced and delicious about it. This expression has notes of everything so great about the laddie. I’d say it is even more complex. Nose is a sour apple, wood and spice. Palate the hint of crisp laddie with deeper honey, pepper, a hint of orchard fruit in the background and wood spice. the finish is slightly bitter but not off putting. It’s really good, but I’ll be buying the laddie over it if available because there is something about the laddie that, albeit maybe not as complex as this expression,  just hits all the things I love about whisky. There really is no downside to either. Big fan of Bruichladdich."

Taste: candy sweetness at the front that quickly fades into smokiness, also something sour or earthy maybe
Finish: hot, smoke doesn’t linger, dry
After reading reviews: i didn’t get a lot of the fruity sweetness on the nose seen in reviews (pineapple, mango, peach) but perhaps picking up some pineapple on the finish when breathing out, lots of references to cereal which may overlap with my wheat bread note"

4.0,Very similar to the 2007 with a slightly richer nose and palate. 5% difference.
4.0,"Color: Gold.
Nose: Sweet, citrus, very slight anise.
Taste: A little fruit; low dryness; low hardness; low herbalness; slightly hot; no malt; maybe oak; medium peat and pepper; a little salt; tiny spice; mildly smoky; tiny bit sweet maybe; tiny bit woody.
Finish: Very smooth.
This was quite good. The ice opened up and ramped up every facet of the whisky, but only at first. It was very harsh and ruined afterward and you'll benefit from being able to control the account of water added. This may have influenced a slight decrease in my scoring."

3.75,"My first Bruichladdich whisky. Surprised by the initial heat on the tongue. Reminded me of tasting something with a high rye mashbill. The nose was sugar cookies with hints of citrus. Unpeated, but the classic Islay smoke and brine is present, yet not too overpowering. My favorite thing was the full, oily texture. Loved that the barley used was locally grown. You don't get any closer to a place than tasting it."

3.5,"Part two of the Wee Laddie tasting set review. 

*Note this is not the same as the whisky listed as this was bottled specifically for the tasting set and does not have a vintage or farm of origin. I didn’t feel it was worth creating a new entry. 

The second whisky in this set is the Bruichladdich Islay Barley. This is different from the Classic Laddie in that all of the barley is grown specifically on Islay, the idea being that the terroir really does make an impact on the final product. Like the Classic Laddie, this is bottled at 50% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of yellow gold, and is also unpeated. 

The nose has lots of strong barely notes, honey and lemon citrus. Damp, musty and earthy. Like it’s unpeated brother, this too has a very peated feel to it right off the bat. Lemon squares, faint golden apples, peaches, pineapple and grilled plums. A touch mineral with some wheat bread. Vanilla and oak, maple, toffee, butterscotch and buttery pecans. Very light raspberries as well. 

The palate is quite spicy, very malty with lots of honey, hay, lemons and salty. Oak and heat, very green and slightly vegetal. Apricots and ginger. Young, vibrant, and spirit forward, but not very complex. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is oily and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long, spicy, oaky and salty. 

I’m not impressed with this whisky. Yes it is presented with pride as it is NCF and NC and at 50%, but it doesn’t have enough going for it taste wise and is a bit too intense to really enjoy. It does show that terroir does matter (or more to the point that the barley varietal matters) and shows that (presumably) changing nothing but the barley can make a huge difference on the intrinsic properties of the spirit. I did not try adding water, which may have helped. As it stands I’m giving it a 3.5. 
Cheers"
