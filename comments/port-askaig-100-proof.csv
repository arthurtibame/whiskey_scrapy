3.0,"Yet another sample dram from my gift set. 

An intriguing NAS juice from a mystery distiller on Islay...but who? Admittedly, I haven't enjoyed enough Islays in my so far brief malt tasting journey to hazard a guess. With no expert tasting notes from Distiller staff and scant user reviews, I was completely without any expectations, except that I figured it would be peaty, as an Islay, and expected it would be potent, given the 57.1% ABV. I don't even know what sort of cask finishing this whisky underwent. But, I went ahead and added about a 1/4 teaspoon of water to the 1 oz dram and let it rest for 15 minutes to open up. 

Pale in the glass with not much in the way of legs on swirling. On the nose, it is malty, with a sweet tart note akin to perhaps a Riesling. Also, a healthy dash of cigar ash asserts itself with an intensity equal to the other notes combined and then some. No sea spray, ships ropes, boat house, kelp, brine, or other nautical/maritime themes seemed to be present. 

On the palate, it is surprisingly sweet. Plenty of honey to offset some of the harsher qualities. Make no mistake, this stuff gets your attention. The cigar ash, although not as prominent on the palate as on the nose, is integrated throughout, from first introduction on the tip of the tongue to the fairly long finish. The heat of the high ABV coupled with the ash gives the impression of smoking a very peppery cigar. 

There is very little of the salt and iodine expected from an Islay, and none of the rubber or bandaid notes that often accompany Islay malts. However, after the finish subsided, I noticed upon exhaling through my nose that there was the distinct essence of Cephacol sore throat spray, giving it a medicinal quality at the very end. 

Overall impressions?  Oddly enough, I rather liked it, although I doubt I would go through the pains of seeking it out. I don't think I could get it locally. I would give it 3.5 stars for being good at what it does, which is giving the impression of drinking a strong single malt while smoking a peppery cigar. It doesn't offer waves of morphing and changing layers of complexity like a good peaty Highland (think Talisker or Highland Park) or lots of maritime and medicinal notes of some of its Islay brethren. Very nice to sample, though."

4.0,"Nose reminds me initially of sake before I found the salt and smoke notes. 
The flavour was completely unexpected,especoally because of its pale hue when poured. I had to have a second look to conform it wasn't clear! Then, on tasting, sweetness! spice!   all things nice! This was one of the most surprising drams I have had in a while."

3.75,"Light smoke, smooth, sweet notes"
4.5,"I love this stuff so much that the day after I cracked open my first bottle, I ran back to the store to buy 3 more. The high ABV really amplifies all of the flavours. Simultaneously sweet and savoury, but the smokey notes are the highlight for me. Almost has a mesquite note. If you can find it, get it!"
4.25,Lots of depth Smokey sweet vanilla all at once with a lingering sweet sea like peat very smooth enjoyable gets sweeter with a little water not too much though. Would compare to lagavulin 16 or 8 cask strength from memory though would love to go head to head with those
5.0,very smooth. very smoky. loved by all in the house.
4.0,"pretty peaty, water made it 10x better (4 drops)."
1.5,"Not a fan. Unpleasant nose, but peat is present. Poor expression of Islay.
Adding three droppers of water helped soften the harshness of drink."
1.5,Difficult to drink.  Torn between sip-able and gross.  Nose like burning pine trees.

4.0,"Fair amount of peat, aniseed and pipe tobacco on the nose. The mouthful is silky, with a sweet and salty combination of dark caramel and sea salt on the palate. The finish is lightly smoked, spiced and fairly long. All the flavours come together quite nicely for me. Really good stuff."
4.0,"I should first get out of the way the fact that this whisky's white wine color is striking, and not in a good way. Is this thing 3 weeks old? Despite that, the nose is actually wonderful and refreshing, with its combination of key lime, barley (white ale beer) and peat. The palate adds some smoke and at 57% ABV needs some water to tame, but man is this good. Even the finish is a success, with its long and savory finish. Call me crazy, but my spidey senses tell me this whisky is suspiciously reminiscent of the Caol Ila 12. Recommended!"
3.0,Not quite the Octomore but the peatiness was not far off - not bad

3.5,"Pale straw colour, a real mix of lemon and very gentle smoke on the nose, with the faintest hint of barley sugar and menthol. On the palate, lemon, citrus zest, somewhat minerally and a white pepper heat towards the end that dries the mouth. Medium finish, more of that lemon but leaving a dry heat as it disappears."

4.5,"One of the smoothest, well-balanced and controlled, sweet-peated drams I've had.
Nose: Smells like I'm smoking meats over hot coals. Slight hint of lemon zest with a subtle nose of sweetness.
Palate: Interestingly not overpowered by the peat here - sweet apple cider with the lemon zest shining more here. The meat we smoked earlier is more prominent.
Finish: Long, smokey-peat finish - well drawn out, strong Lapsang Souchong tea.
While not one to blow a Peathead out of the water, this dram is well-balanced and refined. So incredibly smooth and classy."
