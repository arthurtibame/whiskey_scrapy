2.0,"On the nose, lights fruits, predominantly green apple and citrus.  Accompanied by a pine tartness. 

On the palette, there is a sweetness, but flavor is extremely light. Slightly oaky. Personally, I find very little flavor here. 

The finish fades quickly, and the limited flavors that were initially present quickly disappear. 

Overall, it is a light and friendly whiskey. I imagine a more finely-tuned connoisseur can discover the flavors here. For me, there’s not enough to justify devoting any more time or money towards this product."

2.5,"I know it's an icon, but I am just not a fan.  The flavors are hidden in the dryness.(Like a painfully dry Sauvignon Blanc but not in a good way) The nose seems interesting enough, but it doesn't translate into flavor.  I do not favor very sweet drams, but this dry short finish is more than I can take.  It is available everywhere and it doesn't break the bank.  Unfortunately, it does nothing for me...except make me exceptionally thirsty."

Overwhelemed with options, I found the next-most familiar name available and picked this up. You can't go wrong with it. Give it as a gift, or drink it with some friends. This one is meant to be shared."

4.5,"Wonderful mix of single pot and grain whiskeys. One of the smoothiest drams I have ever tasted. Can be enjoyed neat, on the rocks and in coctails. Jameson, ginger ale and a wedge of lime is a classic. Great whiskey all in all. 
When I prepare my Irish Coffee cocktail I prefer to have more robust whiskey than Jameson. Maybe Jameson Black Barrel."
4.0,"Surprisingly good and smooth, i really enjoyed this dram. Totally unexpected since it is a cheap accesible whiskey. 

On the nose you get Chocolate,Orange, Pine, Plum and a little Vanilla.

On the palate, is very smooth and sweet and refreshing with cocoa and orange notes. Finish is very short"

3.0,"Nose is fresh and bright, super fruity with aroma of peaches & pears for days, followed by some honey and apples.

Palate starts off sweet, then transitions into buttery apples with a hint of citrus.

Finish is quick and dry with not much else going on. 

A fine Irish whisk(e)y for the money... I like to start with this to prime the system before getting into something more substantial."

3.25,El caballito de batalla de los whiskys irlandeses triple destilados. Ideal para comenzar el viaje de la suavidad y tratamiento de la semillas con vapores y no humos. Ya en nariz empieza la experiencia. Tanto para alguna medida solo o usarlo para tragos suaves considerandolo en eso.

3.0,Standard sweet Irish. Honeyed butter and biscuits. Add a dash of a strongly peated budget Islay for a great contrasted but friendly dram!
3.5,It’s Jameson
4.0,"Nose: Floral with a touch of copper pot aroma. Subtly fruity, mainly banana and apple coming through. Some rich sweetness of vanilla. Slightly oaky as well.

Palate: Pretty quiet actually despite having such an active nose. Very slight amounts of fruit blending with a decent amount of malty flavor. Some grassy notes and slight spice.

Finish: Brief. Malt strongest here and the oak from the nose comes back to say goodbye. A pleasant and crisp finish.

Overall Thoughts: I certainly won’t act like this is the first time I’ve ever had Jameson. It’s the most popular Irish whiskey on the planet. And I think it holds that title for a good reason, it’s a damn good whiskey. No, it isn’t the greatest thing you’ll ever have in your life, but it’s complex enough to start a flavor/aroma debate, and it’s not offensive or overpowering in the way that some lower-priced whiskeys are. I always have a bottle of Jameson at home. Never a bad choice, in my opinion."
4.0,Damn fine daily drinker and makes a mean cocktail.
3.5,"Nose: overall a gentle sweetness, some raisins & chocolate
Taste: warm and sweet, in the beginning some spices. Some chocolate and coffee.
Finish : general warmth, some pepper"

4.0,"Nose: Green apple, vague sweetness. As I sipped I started to pick up on a spice smell I can’t quite place.
Palate: Green apple keeps going with a butterscotch coating. Little oak. Smooth, alcohol is almost unnoticeable.
Finish: Butterscotch fades quickly and leaves a trail of oak behind it."
