3.5,"Appearance: Looking in at this special scotch I notice its light clover honey gold color, most likely given from its relatively young age of eight years and with no coloring being added. Medium sized viscous legs crawl their way down the glass.

Nose: On the nose, notes of light ashy campfire smoke appear followed by fruity ripe red apples with cinnamon, pear, orange rind, green grapes, honey, heather, pine, and a strange Pinesol note towards the end.

Taste: The delicious palate consists of clove, cardamom, cracked pepper, caramel and honey, and orange notes.

Finish: The finish starts hot at first then cools into a sweeter honeyed finish with a creamy mouthfeel.

Thoughts: This special edition scotch was delicious and a friend of mine was generous enough to let me have some. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who would happen across it. Fettercairn, many thanks! Sláinte!"
