4.0,"This one is an oldie. A Ballentine's 12yo Pure Malt, which inmidiately trasports us back to before 2005, where the term ""pure malt"" was a legal definition to a ""vatted malt"" or as the law compels now: ""blended malt"". That means that there is no grain whisky in this blend, it has been made entirely from different single malts.

Bottled at 40%abv, i would believe this bottle is from 2002 or 2003. 12yo statement. 

On the nose: Grassy; Dry grass; Hay; Vanilla and Malted barley.

On the palate: Super smooth; Vanilla and Heather.

Aftertaste is great! It is the best part. Malted barley finish but very elegant; dim peatiness and Heather.

Overall this is a very interesting dram, although it could be a little too straightforward, but is like a piece of history nowadays. 84 over 100."
2.5,Not much taste.
