4.25,"It's no secret that I am a certified Barrell fan! There Whiskey's are always adventurous and unique so I always like to try a pour prior to purchasing a bottle. Especially since this one includes the following components:

Bourbon Distilled in Indiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky

Crafted and bottled in Kentucky

118.4 proof cask strength bottling

9-years-old

Aged in American white oak barrels; finished in Bourbon, American brandy, and Amaro barrels, and Cognac casks

Mash bill: corn, rye (high and low), malted barley

So some very unique finishing which is why I was hesitant to buy a bottle. Let's dive in:

Upon entry is very rich with a medium to high viscosity. Notes are cherries, plums, rich burnt brown sugar and maple syrup. It's definitely sweet but in a natural and pleasant way. Mid palette adds more wood influence and clove leading to an oak and fresh juicy red fruit finish. 

Again what they do so well is integrate all the grape spirit finishing with the Bourbon to compliment but not overwhelm it. You have no doubt you are drinking a Whiskey. The proof is felt but is in perfect balance. Adding water intensifies the grape influence and I preferred it neat. 

I will be buying a bottle and recommend it to the adventurous Whiskey drinker or any Barrell fan. Cheers all!"
