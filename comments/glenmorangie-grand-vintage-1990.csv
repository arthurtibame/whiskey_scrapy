4.5,"Fancy! This is my review for the Glenmorangie 1990 Grand Vintage Malt, which is now a yearly tribute to some bond warehouses that this distillery had. This is a 25yo expression, bottled in 2016 (math teachers required, lol). A really beautiful bottle that goes for around $460 - $520. 

Bottled at 43%abv

The aroma is such a perfect treat for your nose: Orange candy. Caramel very refined. I am getting some sherriness out of this,
Definitively figs and maraschino cherries. Amazing complex aroma. Coffee, brown sugar, Apples. 

So complex! It just throws you different aromas every time. Orange madness. Vanilla.

On the palate it is a lot less complex and down to earth, very well balanced though. Vanilla surrounded by Oak spice. Sherriness a little bit. Caramel. A bit Fancy, Refined dram. Maybe a little boring. 

Aftertaste gives you something more, enhancing the experience of tasting it. It is Dry, Grassy. Hay and Ginger spice. 

Overall this is a very good whisky. Palate can be better, but i understand that fancy whiskies are often easy to drink rather than complex and full of layers of flavor. Still, it makes it to a solid 90 over 100, which might be consider poetic justice for a 1990 dram."

5.0,"Rich peaches and Chantilly cream give this floral pastry puff of a whisky a delightful and elegant body. While it takes some time to open up, if you have the patience you will be well rewarded with the depths and breadth of the flavour profile increasing in scope. A dash of water causes an increase in brightness, that I felt unnecessary. Gorgeous to look at, better smelling, and deceptively easy to drink. Surely this white leather clad angel can do no wrong"

5.0,Very impressed with this dram. Notes of honey and vanilla characteristic of Glenmorangie but an understated maturity that comes with sitting in casks for 26 years. Jim Murray gave this a well-deserved massive rating of 94 and I'm sure if you like the 18 and 25 year Glenmorangie you will agree.

5.0,"I had a sample of this over the weekend at a friend's place.   This is like dating a supermodel, only then to go back to a normal person.  Or flying first class on Singapore airlines, only then to fly coach on Spirit airways.  Once you have this, how can you simply appreciate the others?  This is every sin and vice wrapped up in a fancy bottle, that has aromas of honey and oranges, and an absolutely rich taste of the finest Belgian chocolates coating your mouth.  To say this is a really elegant rich whisky is an understatement.  Not sure I'd buy one at its current price ( either this or the mortgage...I'm going with the mortgage), but am thankful for the experience."
