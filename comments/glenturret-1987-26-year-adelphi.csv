4.0,"Another distillery that is new to me. Owned by Edrington, I think most of the output goes into Famous Grouse and is rarely bottled as a single malt. That’s a shame, because if this cask is typical it deserves to see the light of day more often. The nose is creamy with hints of coconut. The cream continues on the palate, where it is joined by shortbread and malty flavors. Another worthy bottling sampled at an evening with Adelphi."
