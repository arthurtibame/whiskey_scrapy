3.75,"The nose was fantastic.  Chocolate Baileys; chocolate and caramel. The palate I had to work on. Predominantly raisin and xmas cake with a slight burnt caramel astringency and bitterness and the balance not really there.The longer you took on this one the better it got, however I wouldn't say it ever moved into the great category for me unlike the 35 year old (which I can see why that won medals). It is however the first time I've tasted whiskies in their 50's, one of the few categories older than me...a diminishing category :-). I've seen mixed reviews on this one. 3.75 for me."
