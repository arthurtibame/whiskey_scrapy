With a few more sips I notice some sweet honeyed notes.  It isn't very overpowering in terms of frutiness, so this is good for scotch drinkers who don't mind the lack of smokiness.  There is a strong spicy kick in the finish that I find to be increasingly pleasant. My current favorite of the Bushmills line.  Will continue to enjoy and recommend!"

At $80 a bottle, this is really solid. You know where your money goes for a 16-year-old bottle. It’s enjoyable from start to finish and I’m happy it’s in my collection."

4.0,"We went back to Chicago for the holiday weekend. As luck would have it,  a good friend of mine from my days in Ghana was passing through the city, so once the toddler was tucked in for the night, I met up with a small group of folks at my favorite Irish pub in my old neighborhood. After the opening rounds of Guinness, I decided it was time for whiskey...what else goes as well with old friends and good conversation? Having never tried an aged Bushmills, I decided to spring for a pour of this, and I don't regret it. The nose is darkly fruited, with berries and dried fruit to be found alongside dark chocolate fudge studded with walnut. This rings true to the palate; there are no surprises here. For flavors I associate with heavier, richer whiskies, the lightness of the spirit is a bit surprising I suppose, but even then, it's Bushmills. The finish comes across as a bit short, but not distractingly so. This isn't a perfect dram, but it's a very enjoyable one...especially when you're looking for that ideal drop of whiskey for savoring with friends on a quiet late summer evening, but that isn't going to eclipse the conversation."

4.75,"info: Un Irish de la fameuse distillerie Bushmills (la plus ancienne enregistré) issue d'un assemblage de whiskies de 15 et 16 ans. Le premier ayant vieilli dans des fûts de bourbon américain et le deuxième dans des fûts de chêne européen ayant contenu du Xérès (Oloroso Sherry Butts). Après l'assemblage de ces deux whiskies, le liquide subit une année supplémentaire de veillissement en Port Pipes. La distillerie clame que c'est l'un de ses whiskies les plus aboutis et gourmands. Beaucoup de récompenses pour ce whisky, notamment le titre de meilleur Single malt irlandais aux ""World Whiskies Awards"" de 2008 et la médailel d'argent au San Francisco World Spirits competition en 2011.

Nez: Frais. Des noisettes, du caramel, du chocolat, des fraises fraiches trempées dans le chocolat. 

Bouche: Wow! Savoureux à souhait! J'avais peur pour l'intensité à de taux de 40% mais, c'est vraiment intensément savoureux malgré le faible taux de 40%. C'est d'une douceur impressionnante! D,une complexité aromatique enivrante ! Fruits rouges, baies des champs, mielleux, texture soyeuse, prunes ou raisins, des épices de sherry (plus subtile), le port pipe est très présent. Chocolat au lait et Nutella. Plus juteux que boisé mais la finale annonce ses notes de chênes.

Finale: étonnamment plus sèche et boisé malgré l'entré juteuse. Bleuet et framboises sur une toast au Nutella. Cette touche cuivré métallique qui rappelle celle du Coca-Cola. Alors que l'on pensait que c'était fini, on a une incroyable finale!

Overall: J'adore! Probablement mon 2e Irish préféré (le Redbreast 21 au 1er rang). Tellement savoureux! Sa explose de partout! C'est un whisky qui va plaire autant au débutant (pour sa douceur) que les amateurs plus avancé (pour sa complexité). Le seul problème? En trouver... et faire attention de ne pas le boire trop vite! 95%"

A hint of cloves, too, and a slightly larger hint of cinnamon. Very little heat, so it goes down super smooth. Honestly, a solid, low-affect spirit, and preferrable to considerably more expensive and more heralded offerings -- for instance, I would take this over a Macallan 12 or Johnnie Walker 18 any day of the week. Good to have around when there's no one to impress, and you want to sip on something solid that doesn't require much thought."

3.25,"There is a fair amount going on here and the drink is quite tasty. Caramel and apricot are present, but they are not sickly sweet and are not overwhelmed by the wood either. Herbal notes come through at times. The drink is smooth and the flavor is not too strong, but it is full and rich. Hints of cinnamon come through, but nothing too harsh is here. There is nothing off about this drink and it is quite smooth. A bit more liveliness and variation over the duration of a swig would be nice, but this is quite good nonetheless. About on par with Auchentoshan Three Wood. Not amazing, but quite tasty and maybe worth stocking at its price. The Auchentoshan Three Wood is a little better and less expensive though."

4.0,"Nose: Apples! Pears! Bright shiny unmalted barley - begorrah, we're back in Ireland again. Ahem, sorry. Over time the nose settles into a nutty, soft oak and subtle sherry character which is pretty nice. Warm and well balanced with red berries coming to the fore, it's a very relaxing and attractive nose. As it rests, several container loads of vanilla appear and later dark fruits and raisins are noticed.

Palate: Sweet and mildly spicy arrival with an excellently balanced cereal, malt and dark fruit character. The development is an interesting intensification of the arrival - everything seems to become a shade darker, richer and more malty and the presence of some good quality sherry casks is apparent. Hazelnuts and chocolate praline appear and you can taste the presence of the port pipes through the rich red, plummy berry flavours that permeate the spirit. Not bad - not bad at all. The texture is slightly creamy and dulcet.

Finish: Medium/short. The dominant malty personality fades into a Celtic twilight with a slight berry and chocolate overtone. There is a brown sugar/treacle note coating the mouth that lasts and lasts.

This is the first Bushmills whiskey I've tasted that I actually liked. No only did I like it, I would consider buying a bottle for the luxurious profile if nothing else. This is several light years ahead of the banal Bushmills 10 - you can barely sense that the two expressions are from the same distillery. I could happily adopt this as a nightcap dram.

I get absolutely no smoke on this whisky at all. I'm not sure where other folks are finding it. Maybe the slightest hint of barrel char?

At the asking price this is good value, and one of the few Irish whiskies at this price point that I'd consider buying instead of a Scottish single malt.

Tasted from a 30ml sampler.

3.25,"Ah, Bushmills.  Up until I recently devoured bottles of the Green and Yellow Spots, this was one of my favorite Irish whiskies- alongside a few West Cork releases.  This 16yo Bushmills that advertises Port Wine finishing really had me thoroughly excited.  I had a sample of the 21 year old Bushmills a couple of years ago and I believe I gave it a perfect score of 5 stars.  It was a delicious, complex dram.  I was hoping for similar results here...

Well, let’s just say, that didn’t happen.  This 16 year old release contains 2 whiskies: one aged in ex-bourbon casks and the other in ex-Spanish Oloroso sherry casks.  They were blended together and then finished for an additional 6-9 months in ex-Port wine casks.  It was then where I believe this whiskey went awry:  it was blended down to 40% ABV.  It’s weakness is where I place all the blame for the negative aspects I detected in this dram.

It’s a beautiful, dark copper in the Glencairn (which I’m not sure if there was color added).  There were large, watery drops that were chased down by undefined, heavy legs.  There even seemed to be a thin layer of water overtop of the entire pour.

The nose was initially soft wood and sweet raisins but was ultimately taken over by a nutty dominance that never released its hold.  Giving it time and a concentrated nosing I was able to pick up faint notes of grape must and bitter chocolate.

The palate stayed true to the nosing with raisins, grapes and cereal oatmeal with a slow-burning, wood characteristic that neither excited, nor hurt the overall flavor profile.  It was just a constant, yet restrained smoke.  The infusion of a drop of water only killed what was already a weak mouthfeel.  An oily mouthcoat might have actually saved this dram for me, but alas, the watery feel washed everything quickly away.

This also left the finish a bit wanting.  It ended up very short and sickly sweet.  Smoky wood and chocolate gave it a funky aftertaste that left me disinterested in trying to pick up more from this dram.  This bottle really begs for a higher punch from the ABV- I think 44-46% would’ve given this one some heat and necessary character.

Overall, the biggest plus I got from this bottle was the sale price- I picked it up out of the U.K. for a song:  $59.  I’ve seen prices here in the USA for $125+.  There’s no way it’s worth that price, but $59 is an absolute steal and a price is actually pay again for a bottle of this caliber.  Sadly, I doubt I’ll see it again at that level.  It’s still a middle of the road dram, and if you’re a Bushmills fanboy then I’d say splurge for a bottle if you can find it under $100.  Otherwise, pony up the extra and buy the 21 year old or divert that money to a bottle of wine finished Green Spot.  That’s money better spent, IMHO.  As is, this is a 3.25-3.5 star dram, tops.  Cheers."

4.0,"Bushmills got it's grant to distill in 1608. While not a requirement, Irish Whiskey is often distilled three times, making it much smoother and easier to drink at the cost of loosing complexity in flavor some say. This 16 year aged expression combines spirits aged in three different types of wood as well: sherry, bourbon, and port barrels. The result is one of the best and most flavorful Irish Whiskey on the market.
Lots of floral and orange blossoms notes on the nose followed by taste of orange, nuts, and honey. Slightly lingering on the finish with dark chocolate and black pepper."

Finish tastes like a mix of apricots and pears. Usually a Redbreast guy, but I may have to try other Bushmill products out. Only negative is the low abv. $28 a pour"
