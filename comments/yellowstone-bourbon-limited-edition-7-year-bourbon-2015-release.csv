4.0,"Better than expected. I only picked this up because there were only 6,000 bottles produced (so I bought 3). I'd read some bad and not so bad reviews so I wasn't expecting much. Pleasanty surprised. You can definitely taste the heavy Rye influence. Although I can still taste the vanilla & burnt sugar."
4.0,This is really good

4.0,Really good taste.  Smooth and a little sweet.  100 proof.
3.0,"Definitely still has its lowbrow spunk, but a nice finish and drinks nice! (2016 vintage)"
4.0,Very spicy bourbon! Sweet brown sugar and vanilla upon entry. Spices kick in mid pallette thru the long finish. Tobacco and oak as well. Very tasty with a solid burn. Well done.
