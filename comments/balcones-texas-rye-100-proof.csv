3.0,"It's cinnamon and apples on the nose, the palate is dry oak and cinnamon red hots. The finish is dry and oak with a burning warmth. This is a good Rye that is not too edgy or hot for its age and proof, don't fear the poor reviews on this and take advantage of a 100 proof Texas Rye that's under $35"

5.0,4.5 for me. Awesome unique chocolate rye flavor bomb.
5.0,"nose: sweetened butter
palate: spicy and nutty
finish: the best part, chocolate and peanut butter

a bit of heat in this dram, not too bad though"

5.0,"Nose is meh, lots of ethanol (for a 100 proof). On the palate however, things get interesting. Sooo much chocolate, more than anything I’ve tried (300+ bottles in cellar). And the finish goes on for days. Very unique for a rye, be prepared. I love it, and will be buying 2-3 back ups."

5.0,Sweet caramel nose. It has the typical spiciness of rye but it has an espresso on the start with a dark chocolate finish
2.25,"Smells very sweet, like maple syrup, with some sour rye notes as well. A bit of cardboard on the palate, which transitions to coffee that lingers. This could pass for a rum. 11/16/18"

3.0,"Anyone reading my reviews knows I'm not the biggest rye whiskey fan, and while I love the guys at Balcones (love me some single malt and True Blue!), this one falls flat for me. Some of the Canadian ryes sit well with me because they manage their casks in a way that balances out the spiciness of the rye grains, but here in the ol' US of A, it seems like distillers of ryes tend to lean into the spiciness, and I really can't blame them, because it holds up better in cocktails and over ice. Still, as something to drink neat, this one's not for me.

The nose is powerful, just like all Balcones expressions that aged in the brutal Texas heat, and the 50% alcohol contributes as well. On the nose, once you work past the rye spice, you get some dark chocolate and coffee notes, which are altogether pleasant. In a previous review of this whiskey, I ate dark chocolate while I drank it, and it was a fine pairing! A revisit though fell short for me, and I found myself struggling to finish, even with the addition of a little water.

The palate is strong, and the spice is a bit too overwhelming for my taste. You continue to get some of those chocolate notes, and the finish lingers with you. I used the rest of this bottle to make Old Fashioned cocktails (which was most excellent) rather than drink it neat, but since that's how I like to review things, that's where we stand right now."

4.0,"As @PBMichiganWolverine  noted, this was the top discovery of the otherwise disappointing Whisky Live show in New Jersey. Thanks to the generosity of the brand rep, I was able to spend some time with a sample at home to see if it tasted as good as it did at the show. And it did, for the most part. The nose is unlike any other rye I’ve tried. It’s orange oil and cloves, though if you persist there’s a hint of grassiness that speaks to its roots. In the mouth, the dominant flavor is a most unexpected creamy chocolate that persists into a finish of chocolate milk. A drop of water brings out more of the grassy aromas on the nose, while the palate turns more milky. My only reservation is that the strength of the alcohol numbed my lips slightly, which I found a little distracting. That’s not something I’ve experienced before with higher strength whiskies, so I don’t if it was something peculiar about the spirit or just a random weird reaction on my part. That aside, this is a unique and exciting whisky at a very affordable price. As much as I love rye, my experience has been that one distiller’s product tastes broadly similar to another’s, with the notable exception of the funky Lock Stock and Barrel 15. Balcones hints at a more diverse future for this category."
5.0,"I’m bumping this up to 5 stars.  The Balcones rep at WhiskyLive gave me a small little “take away” of about 2 ounces in a vial.  Having this alone without other tastings, and a substantial amount rather than just a sip, I feel as if I’m able taste it more fairly.  Nose is mocha-ish, think a mixture of dark chocolate and coffee.  But, wow...the palette...tasted blind I’d have confused this for spiked dark coffee.  It’s probably the thickest whiskey I’ve ever had...as if someone mixed in Texas oil with the water.  Personally, I love it...but it’s not for everyone.  If you go in expecting to have your classic rye, which tastes grassy and minty, this ain’t it."
4.0,"At NJ Whiskylive, for me, this was the surprise hit. 100% Rye. But...Nothing like rye at all, more like a coffee / mocha liqueur. Thick and oily. For $40, a no-brainer."
4.0,I get chocolate and vanilla with some dry tobacco on the front. It’s hot on the front and back until you add some ice. Ice makes it a smooth sipper. Good stuff.

1.75,"Upon first sniff I swear it smelled like cheap tequila. Man this stuff is funky. Lite-Medium body, thin, definitely doesn’t coat the tongue. Good deal of spices and herbs; tastes medicinal without much quality flavor. Everything I envision a household cleaning product would taste like. Though it does finish with a hint of chocolate and coffee."

I think it’s the grain coming through too much combined with the oppressive amount of tropical fruit, which I would love on a plate in Mexico, but not in a whiskey. Mushy overripe apples is what the Distiller expert says, and that's spot on. Specifically, it tastes like red delicious apples, the worst kind of apple. I didn’t finish this dram."

1.25,"I tried this at a Balcones tasting and remember it being very spicy and liking it, however on purchase it tastes like a completely different whiskey. The first two pours from the bottle were decent, but as it's opened up the chocolate and coffee notes have become overwhelming. It's a chore to drink neat, and tastes almost like a flavored whiskey in cocktails."

4.25,"*Accidentally deleted original review. Decided to update*

A rye like no other. Great neat or in a classic cocktail!

This is a Balcones product through and through: high proof with rich, dense flavors. It does have that typically rye spice, but you also get notes of caramel, citrus on the nose with some dense dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is my favorite part. There's some burn followed by a hit of spice and nuttiness. The dark chocolate finish is what makes this interesting. This rye has a long finish that will carry over into your next drink. I tried this rye in a Manhattan and Old Fashioned and loved it. It adds a unique richness and depth to these drinks that I enjoy, but I also enjoy dark chocolate. 

I'll definitely be keeping this on my shelf."

3.5,"Overall a fascinating spirit. Incredibly dark notes on the palate with chocolate and hazelnut, almost to a cocoa powder degree. The nose is much more refined, with subtle dark cherry. As a 100% Rye, it really catches you off guard. My guess is this spirit was a wild horse out of the still; 1.5yr of aging likely calmed this down to something enjoyable. The pepper eludes me!"

1.75,"I immediately knew I wouldn't like this from this smell. I couldn't remember exactly what it reminded me of, but the taste of it was just as negatively familiar.

Then I read the description, and I realized. I really don't like that chocolate rye malt flavor.  It's less strong than some of the other chocolate rye malt whiskeys that I've had but even a width of it turns me off of the whole thing entirely. 

Look. Maybe you like that chocolate rye malt thing that Woodford did or Corsair did, but this tastes like oval teen flavored scotch. It's going to be a no for me, dawg"

Nose: musty, apples, nutty, rum, molasses, grassy

Taste: sharp, oak, vanilla extract, woodsy, menthol, tobacco"

2.0,I tried to like it. Knowing taste buds can be different at times I kept at it. Finished the bottle. At times there was a musty funk taste and then there was the taste without the mustiness. It’s not for me.
3.25,"Flaviar sample: ok, I had this right after Balcones single malt and I get the same unusual note on the nose: banana/pear. Nose is pepper and Balcones banana/pear. Palate is significantly better: pepper, tobacco, lots of spice, wood. My favorite Balcones product so far."

2.0,"Nose:
Yeasty raisin bread, milk chocolate, musty oak, classic balcones funk

Palate:
Stale black coffee, almost a soapy taste, dark fruit, burnt toast

Finish:
Pretty long, the flavor reminds me of the aftertaste from eating an espresso bean

Overall:
Very unique. I’ve never had a rye with any of these flavors. Having said that, I think I may have found a balcones I don’t really care for... and I LOVE balcones."
