2.0,"I went and had a tasting down at their distillery. The Bull Moose is definitely a young rye whiskey, and slightly overpowering even with a few drops of water.  Strong alcohol on the nose. The palate is rich in sweet citrus. Overall not too shabby, but nothing amazing.  If you can get over to LIS, I would recommend trying their XO Brandy. It's s bit more engaging!"

3.0,"Not as spicy as I prefer my rye. Has a sweet character, but not overpoweringly. Not super distinct, but a solid rye."
null,Cocktailable. Cloves. Spices. Not bad
