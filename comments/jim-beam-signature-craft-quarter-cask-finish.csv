3.0,"Sweet nose with a touch of oak.  Dark fruit flavor with notes of oak. Oak/ nutty finish & lingering flavor with a touch of dark fruit & alcohol.
Recommend to anyone that wants a oak forward bourbon with notes of rich dark fruit."
4.5,"Can't believe I found this for $33 for a 750ml bottle!  Given the ex bourbon/sherry cask finishing I'm pretty excited as I really liked the PX Sherry finished Distiller's Masterpiece.

Nose: Sweet vanilla and brown sugar with dried cherry and fig.  This has the usual Jim Beam boiled peanuts but kind of a dusty note that mixes with a little bit of funk and comes out a little bit like hazelnut in the end.

Flavor: Very bourbony right up front with vanilla and dark sugars but right away more dark fruit and a little bit of sherry funk.  It's a little spicy too with quite a bit of oak.

Finish:  More rye spice and dark fruit fades in to a heavily drying oaky finish.  Very long and keeps going with more drying oak that I assume comes from contact with those small casks.

This is excellent!  The sherry isn't super pronounced, coming forward more with background dark fruit notes but I like the way the sherry notes play with the heavy oak from the quarter casks all overshadowed by the traditional Jim Beam bourbon flavors."
4.25,"My favorite Jim Beam product so far. I get the typical corn, vanilla and peanuts on the nose, but more subdued, with mild sweet merlot, semisweet entry on the creamy and round palate, the finish is medium length, and makes me feel like a swaddled baby, all comforted and content."
4.25,Very full flavored and quite spicy. The quarter cask definitely shows up in this whiskey.
3.5,"It has a very oaky taste, but was vey pleasant and easy to drink. Would buy again"

2.75,"As the signature series bottles tend to be a bit pricey I hope to acquire the set before they all disappear.   

Nose, sweet sherry wine is accurate, some red fruits and brown sugars and warm cinnamons. 

Palate, the first wash of wine sugars hit followed by thin bourbon sugars and wood notes, unfortunately this has too much of the thin white label Beam character in body of the bourbon and the richness advertised in the nose never really develop in the body of the taste.  

The thinness carry's through in the finish with little but mild spice heat and some weak sugars. 

My intrigue in this bottle simply didn't pay off as it doesn't come close to living up to the advertised qualities.  While it has some interesting properties, at the price point it just doesn't earn a ""buy recommend"".  Try out a friends bottle or find one at a bar instead.

This one simply doesn't have what it takes to be a upper shelf Beam product, I would call it a swing and a miss on a ""finish"" style bourbon that can't really compare with even some of the better lower end Beam stuff like the Double Oak or Distillers Cut.   Always hate to downvote a Beam product, but there you have it.

Cheers!"
4.0,"Nose: Dense caramel and heavy red apple, brown sugar, peanut butter, light oak and a bit of smoke.

Taste: Heavy oak with peanut butter and red apple. Brown sugar and vanilla with a spicy rye after taste. Almost a pear note in there. There is also a vague hint of banana. Goes down easy, almost watery."

2.5,"Wood and earthy mushroom notes on the nose. Some cinnamon and caramel as well. On the palate, more wood, a bit astringent. Feels thin, but smooth. Finishes slightly bitter. Light. 11/16/18"
