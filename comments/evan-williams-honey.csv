2.0,I'm not impressed. The smell is nice. The flavor is decent. But the aftertaste is not good at all. Unless I find something that I enjoy mixing this with I doubt I'll be finishing the whole bottle. As Chad said there is no burn at all.

2.0,Sweet syrup texture. Barely any burn to it. Pretty much what you would expect nothing special. Good for sharing with friends and ladies in the winter. Cheap too!

2.75,Won’t win any contests for complexity. It’s my go-to honey whiskey since it’s more whiskey with honey than a honey whiskey as in the Wild Turkey version. There is a slight whiskey burn. The bottle is cheap and affordable.

2.0,"So. Much. Honey. Orange honey, fairly syrupy, but somewhere in there there's alcohol."

3.5,Mind you this is an inexpensive whiskey ... A very tasty honey whiskey. Very smooth and easy to drink even if you do not like straight whiskey. Probably the best handle of honey whiskey you can get for 20$. You really get more than what you pay for.
1.5,what you would expect.  sachrin bs. like honey nut Cheerios

1.0,"American honey is okay, but this is just nasty. Overboard with honey and nail polish taste."
3.0,"Decent sweet flavor, syrupy mouth feel and aftertaste though."

2.0,"Color: The color is a pretty “honey-like” amber.
    
Nose: The nose on this honey flavored whiskey is one of the best I've had amongst its sweet peers. Clovers and faint mint take you on first as well as dried leaves. This is all in addition to the obvious sweet aroma that you'd expect from honey.
    
Taste: The taste is obviously sweet with honey, but it doesn't go as far past the line of sweetness as other honey whiskies have. There's also a earthy note like a black tea mixed in there adding slightly more complexity.
   
 Finish: The finish is medium to lingering in length and sweet with an obvious sparkly honey aftertaste.
    
Opinion: So though I am not a fan of flavored whiskey as a whole, I don't mind honey flavored whiskey. It's sweet, easy, and has some good memories tied to it for me. This one in particular though, is probably my new favorite. It's sweet but not too sweet, tastes like honey but has slightly more complexity than others. Evan Williams is a name and brand that's been around forever and though this may not be everyone's favorite, it's still a product to be proud of! (This would make a great [and dangerous] gateway drink for anyone wanting to get into whiskey.) Thanks Evan Williams! Sláinte!"

5.0,Drinking this straight is wonderful. It's so thick and syrupy that you do not even feel the alcohol. Drank this through college and looked like a badass (I'm not though) because I drank it straight up no chaser. Cheap and well worth one tasting.
