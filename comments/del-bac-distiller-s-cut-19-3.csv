4.25,"Smoky aftertaste is nice. Smooth, leather, hints of vanilla."
4.25,"The barrel finishes add some complexity and help dial back the mesquite smoke a touch, although it is still present. At $65 or so this is an excellent value."

4.25,"Aggressively dark in color.
Strong notes of overripe dark fruit, leather, vanilla, butterscotch, brown sugar and Lemon Pledge on the nose. Smoke is there, but you have to look for it.
Viscous, oily mouthfeel. The extra kick from the 116% abv is perfect.
This one has a sophisticated palate. Just sweet enough to make it entertaining, but not overbearing. Light oak and subtle citrus accents surround a very Scotchy flavor vibe.
Overall, delightful. 4.15."

Bought after a distillery tour. Some harder to find notes than their traditional Dorado. If it was mesquite smoked it’s so buried it only really shows up a bit in the classic Del Bac tobacco note. Hard to tell what impact the tequila barrels played unless you were to try this side by side with their 19-1 and 19-2 distiller’s cuts. If you can find it it’s worth exploring as it is quite complex and unique. Being from AZ I’m for sure biased but I think Hamilton Distillers really is leading the way in American Single Malt, especially of the southwestern variety."
