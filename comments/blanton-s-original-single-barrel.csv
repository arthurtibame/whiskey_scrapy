4.0,Demand and the attempts to keep up with it are really putting a hurting on the quality of this line. I still enjoy it and maybe I've just gotten 2 bottles in a row that are a little off. It is a single barrel product so it could very well be. I'm not gonna say anything negative yet. If the next bottle or 2 doesnt get back to the level I expect for level of difficulty it is to obtain at 55 bucks I will begin to drop my rating.

4.25,"02/07/20, barrel #731, Warehouse H, Rick# 16.
Decided to pull the trigger on this based off reviews and exclusivity. Scored the last bottle too. Hard to get around me. 

Neat: Nose contained a bready essence which gave way to citrus, maple, and spice. Palate had a decent burn. Once numbed, I detected dominant notes of oak and leather. Cherry on the finish. Opening more nutmeg and/or baking spice emerged. 

Ice block: Removed the burn. Muted the fruit and maple somewhat. Thick oily mouthfeel. Subtle oak and leather. Makes it way easier to drink and forget the Abv which can catch up quick if not careful."
4.25,"Light caramel on the nose. Bold flavor with mild heat, great mouthfeel. Very light lingering flavor on the palette."
4.5,This is delicious. Wish it wasn't so hard to find.

4.75,"One of my favorites, sweet and smooth with hints of vanilla and caramel."
1.5,"So this is a store pick but they're all single barrels and my experience tells me they are all over the map too so I'd not be too worried about this vs a normal pick.

Nose - Spiced apples, saw dust...it's really gives me a bit of an apple juice with a touch of cinnamon and maybe just being in a barn while nosing it. Relatively dry and not high on sweet notes, much more balanced than bourbon tends to be. I'm not getting the big vanilla or caramels of a more traditional bourbon. I do get corn.

Taste - A bit of spice, a then a very evenly balanced oak and sweet and earthy profile, which fades into corn bread. There's a drop or two of vanilla. Mostly oak, earthy, corn, more corn, and then some sweet notes here and there. I'm not sure where this one went wrong, but this is pretty below average bourbon. I'd say this is a poor bottle but my recent blanton's bottles have mostly been a bit disappointing. Plenty of alcohol on this one too which at 46.5 seems jarringly out of place. 

I hate to say this, but a part of me just realizes I've moved past Blanton's being a good bourbon to me. I am tasting flaws and imperfections that should have disqualified these barrels from being picked but due to mass production, younger barrels, and the reality that these were never that good, this one was enough better than side by side barrels a store picked it. 

Throwing a couple rocks in for the fun of it. This is after all how most people will drink blantons. Actually, it tastes more like a standard bourbon iced, still nothing special. 

Anyway, I've always felt blanton's was an over priced bourbon, but I used to feel it was still providing a bit of a premium experience. I have to admit, I really do think the bottle was a part of that even back when I started. There is something about mash bill 2 that is perhaps not my preferred choice, but I love small batch EH Taylor for the money.

Anyway 1.5 for me today. I think this is a below average whisky and I'm getting notes that make me debate going lower. It is frankly not that pleasant beyond that nice nose."

4.5,"Finally stumbled across this in the wild(I was shocked to see it) at specs while searching for Laphroaig Lore. Im a drinker not a collector so cracked it right open to see what all the fuss is about. Poured neat, nose is....well its pretty subdued. I like the descriptor of refined as it truly nails it. There is some honey graham cracker, butterscotch, soft gentle oak, light mandarin orange and plum skins all fluttering around with ZERO trace of ethanol. Time and a drop will no doubt bring out more nuance. First sip is so smooth and delicate you need to focus to pull the flavors out. Seriously this is so easy to drink while simultaneously delivering complex bourbon flavors without even a hint of ethanol explains why everyone raves about this. People who cannot handle high proof, beginners who only seek smoothness as well as seasoned drinkers will all find happiness here. Palate is runny caramel and seasoned oak with some nutmeg/allspice baking flare. Not much rye coming through but no matter. There is oiled catchers mitt, melted butter and cashew nuttiness with hint of dust on the back end . Finish is long salted oak, nut butter and caramel /butterscotch fading just a bit dry with cigar leaf and black tea. I think its fantastic and overrated at the same time. I appreciate the exquisite experience this offers yet I don't think it deserves the absolute adoration it receives. It is so hard to find and the price gouging has just added to the mystique. Do I think its excellent bourbon? Yes it is but by no means should you pay ridiculous $$ for it........95/100.........I paid $57 and at that price by all means grab it. Ive seen it going for $100 plus and would have to pass at that level. Imo Bookers,OF120, Stagg Jr all surpass it but that could just be my preference for high proof bold flavors"

Glad I purchased the mini because I still would prefer a handful of other whiskies you can purchase regularly. As far as tasting notes, it tastes like bourbon. Oak spice, not that sweet, not too far off from EHT small batch."

Palate: Sweet corn, oak, rye and the spice that come with it, oily

This dram definitely shows it’s refined age on the Buffalo Trace mash bill. It is certainly enjoyable with rich sweet corn and rye notes. I can see the allure Blanton’s presents but, not the price tag. If you can find a bottle around MSRP or a pour between $9- $15 I say go for it."

The taste profile is rich & viscous, near oily. It's not a sweet whiskey, but there are sweet elements. This has a nicely complex profile with vanilla, caramel, dark cacao, hazelnut, and a slightly citrus finish. Nice barrel presence.

There's a nice warmth and a pepper note that has a slow fade. The better part of this bourbon is the finish. 

This is a fine $50 - $60 whiskey. At $65 I likely won't buy again. IMHO it's not really competitive at $75+.

Drink the whiskey,  not the hype."

4.25,"The flavor is bitter off the bat with some sweetness and remarkable smoothness. I taste wood with a little iodine, red fruit, some walnuts, and a hint of toffee. The bitter notes fade, giving way to a sweet, creamy, and smooth finish. This is a bourbon that I would be happy to sip. The smoothness is really a wonder. This didn't quite knock my socks off, but I quickly realized that I liked it and wanted more. It tastes like it has low rye content, which makes me quite happy.
Rich and surprisingly smooth. There may be some mineral notes here, but there is also plenty of vanilla and toffee with s backing of woody age. This bourbon has a flavor that immediately leaps out as being well-developed and is immensely enjoyable.
It's smooth with some rich woodiness and not too much spice. It's a bit oily, but that mixes nicely with the vanilla, bits of rye tartness, and toffee. It isn't very sweet, but it is very balanced.
This is rich with coffee and toffee. There is not too much spice and the proof is just about right for a drink that is not trying to be cask strength. The balance is exquisite and it does not even need to rely upon high alcohol content to round it out. There are a lot of dimensions here and although they are sometimes muddled, the net result is usually terrific. Each flavor is good and the drink is enjoyable sweet despite its rich backing. I could throw nits at it or I could just say.that it's a delight to drink. This is less rich but arguably more complex than Delord 1981, making it quite a success and a testement that drinks can taste entirely different while being the same in quality.
The nose has mellow wood and chocolate with some harvest fruit. It smells smooth. The palate has some spice, but to is predominantly smooth and rich. You can taste the age here and the complexity gradually builds. There is plenty going on with chocolate, wood, toffee, just enough rye to add interest and make it a little mouth-watering, some hints of apple and cherry, vanilla, cinnamon, tiny bits of nutmeg, kind of a reference to clove, the faintest hint of allspice, and just the right amount of char. This is a masterful bourbon that sets a standard for others to strive for.
Actually, Blanton's tastes like an Armagnac or maybe even a Cognac in comparison to Booker's Kitchen Table. Blanton's tastes relatively weak due to its lower ABV, but its richness and age do start to show, letting it make the case for its quality. The smokiness in Blanton's gives it a mature character, but doesn't balance as well as Booker's does. It's hard to drink Blanton's after Booker's. Russell's Reserve Single Barrel has more of a punch and some nice woody spice mixed with its cherry flavor and strong vanilla than Blanton's does, so its distinct flavors might allow it to be more generally enjoyable, but Blanton's might be more subtle."
4.75,"Nose: Chewy toffee and caramel. Like one of those chews that you get at a parade. Sweeter and more candy nose than other bourbons. Also, no cherry nose like I find with Eagle rare which is a happy find. Vanilla present as well. A little more complexity found if I swirl and take a deeper whiff. 

Taste: Smooth and very little burn. Most likely due to the 80 proof that is bourbon. Usually drink scotch. Not a lot of complexity. Just a great example of what to expect with a pure bourbon. Slightly oily but insignificant compared to an Islay scotch. 

Finish: Nothing substantial that is inconsistent with the initial taste. This whiskey gets it’s rave and appeal because it’s smooth, true to the bourbon style, and has a good marketing/bottling approach. Worth the $60 retail but not something to chase at absurd prices like some whiskey groups sometimes hype. Would maybe consider paying up to $100 if you are a true fan of bourbon and have never had it. Near the best I have but remember, bourbon is so restrictive that very little difference exists among products."

Taste - this bourbon tastes just about how it smells which isn’t always the case. Very rich full and oily to begin. Starts sweet with the vanilla and caramel and maybe some honey. Finish is leather and a spice with some slight tongue burn in what I would describe as a medium long finish. 

Overall and value - I honestly love this bourbon. It’s great and best way to describe it is smooth and complex. For the 50-60$ price point and a very cool story, bottle, and topper you cannot go wrong. Paying secondary I would be a bit underwhelmed. I do hate how hard this bourbon is to find but it is very good."
