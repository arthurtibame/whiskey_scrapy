Taste: Vanilla, Butterscotch, Honey, Apples, Barrel Spice, Grain"
4.0,"This is actually a nice worldly blend with more flavor than the Toki. Dried fruit like in a sherry or wine cask finish, but light and balanced and on a level with Hibiki Harmony. 91"
4.25,smooth with a finishing bite. does not need Ice.
3.25,"Very sweet aroma. Apples and grain. Very strong wood and grain flavor on the palate, maybe even peated? Stronger than most Japanese I've tried. Hits you hard, tastes a little young but is not at all unpleasant. love the wood bite. Tastes more like oak than the usual Japanese wood flavor."
3.75,Will likely suit the Japanese palate but it’s not quite Japanese. The nose is quite weak but the delivery is decent.

4.0,"Surprise pour at end of Suntory tasting involving components of toki and components of Hibiki Harmony. This one is solid with notes of vanilla, caramel, cherry, floral notes, smoke, and dried fruit. This one probably had mostly American and Canadian whisky with its bourbony flavors."

3.25,"Hits with the very sweet palate of all Japanese whiskys. Can't say I taste much of the Beam or Canadian in there (that's a blessing), more peated scotch. A pretty rough alcohol taste but the finish is more complex."
