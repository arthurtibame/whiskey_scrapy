5.0,"Nose is delicate, light smoke and hints of caramel. A hint of salt on the nose. Pallet is rich with complex interplay of peat, meadow flowers, caramel, and a hint of citrus. Aftertaste is long with floral notes and smoke. A few drops of water opens more floral notes on the nose and round the pallet. Very smooth and greatly enjoyable. Too bad they don't make more of it..."

5.0,"It's not every day you have a 30 yr old from a now closed distillery.  So, naturally, any reviews will be slightly biased with the emotional aspect of having a piece of history.  But---regardless...emotionally biased or not...this was simply amazing.  The nose is bit farmy...reminds me of visiting a Pennsylvania farm during harvest season.   Horse saddles.  A bit of hay.  The taste doesn't let down after that nose experience.  Briny, strong and more prominent smoke.  The Pennsylvania horse farm suddenly becomes a  seaside stand selling smoked herring.  With a bit of water, you get prominent fruit with the smoke---some lemons, apples.  
I love this one.  It's not an everyday drink, by  the farthest stretch of the imagination.  But if you're a serious fan of whisky, this has to be on your bucket list."
5.0,I have had various bottles of Brora from many different years.  Always excellent.  The taste sends an electroc shock through me.  By far my favorite whiskey ever.
5.0,Had this from old malt bottelers. Unreal.
