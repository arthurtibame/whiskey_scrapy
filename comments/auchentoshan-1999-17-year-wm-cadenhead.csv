4.0,"Independent bottlings of Cadenhead's rarely disappoint, and this 17-year-old Auchentoshan, distilled in 1999, is certainly no exception (498 bottles, 55.5% ABV). On the nose, you get a complex bouquet of creamy citrus, lemon zest and intense floral notes. With water, the aroma becomes sweeter and gentler. Fresh and zesty in the arrival, there is more lime, grapefruit and strong notes of green tea to be found in the development. The prolonged finish is crisp, very citrusy and with hints of salt and bitter tonic. Boy, what a nice adrenaline shot of a Single Malt!
