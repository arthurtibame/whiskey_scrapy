Color: Pale Gold

Taste: Starts soft but builds up a oak spice quickly with flavors of citrus fruits shinning through. Quite watery with not much body.

Finish: Bitter oak, and peppery spice linger with hints of lemon zest hanging on.

Notes: This is not a very complex dram, but what it does it does very well. It is soft, easy, fruity, and a very good price. This is one that will be on my shelf all the time."

3.25,"Have some hours to spend at São Paulo airport, having arrived early from a connection flight and waiting for my late night flight to Chicago. Brought with me a Glencairn and some samples to help pass the time. Decided to start the fun with an old acquaintance of mine, Aberfeldy 12.

As soon as I put my nose in the glass I'm greeted with the aroma I already knew would be there... honey. And I mean lots and lots of HONEY. There's also some pear, vanilla and ginger spice but they are all covered in thick, sticky honey... I don't mind it, I like honey... ;-)

The palate arrives more spicy than the nose suggests, with some barrel tannins greeting you and causing a tingle sensation in the middle of the tongue. After it calms down you can feel some caramel fudge and honey (again!) sweetness.

The finish is dry and leave an after taste of... You guessed it right, Honey! :-)

So, this is a simple, honest and easy sipper that has honey in spades! It's a one trick pony. You must be in the right mood to enjoy it but overall I like it."

But that is my snobbery talking, not my sense.

A honey, nutty palette fills the mouth with a nice tame finish, a very pleasing dram to say the least.It is the type of drink that even the more whiskey-resistant of friends would have a hard time to poo-poo on.

Would I buy it again? Eh, not sure yet. I will probably at some point, but that is more of a reflexion of the other great expressions out there (including the 18 and 21 of the same name). Great juice for the cost, but as for now I'm good."

3.0,"A Little Whisky”
You’ll notice I say the phrase “a little” before a lot of notes. That’s because this malt (in my opinion) is subtle and light in flavour. Still pretty and priced accordingly.

Nose:
Opens with a drop of water but still very light on the nose
Musk sticks
Perfume floral
Fresh baked Brioche
Cream soda
Honey
Tinned peaches

Arrival:
Syrupy
Brown sugar
Blanched Orange rind 
Light sugar Cinnamon (like on a doughnut)

Development:
Orange rind acidity on the tongue
A little sappy
A little Spicy (baking spice)

Finish:
medium dry finish
A little Numbing clove
Burned biscuit (like roasting coffee)
Cocoa nib bitter

Value to be enjoyed!
Grab it when it’s on special
I love the striking branding on the tube but I think if it was to reflect its contents the colour theme should be soft “musk stick” pink."

3.0,"Appearance: Nice golden, pretty good legs on the swirl for a more moderate strengh drop.

Nose: Some honey, some soft fruit. A bit sweet and just a touch of something caramel like. There's definitely some vanilla too.

Palate: Quite loose, a punch of alcohol, some nice vanilla quality. Soft fruits again, a bit sweet for my personal taste, but some will love it.

Overall: Not bad but I'm just not a huge 'sweet' whiskey fan. There's some lovely fruit flavours coming through, and even some sticky, caramel or toffee notes and it's miles ahead of a lot of regular stuff, but I'm an islay man to my bones!"

4.0,"The third and final bottle I purchased this month for the whiskey club.  Surprisingly the first scotch for the group.  

Nose:  Mmmmm... warm golden malt.  Buttercream and graham crackers with a small amount of ripe pear.  Sultanas and biscuits and a bit of vanilla.  I've seen people say that they smell beeswax and I can definitely confirm that!  We have about 50lbs of it on the shelf in the closet and it's identical (yes, I compared).

Palate: Cool, thick sweetness.  Biscuits, toasted oats, shortbread cookies, maybe a small bit of coconut too.  That graham cracker from the nose comes out on the palate as well.  Lots of heather honey, like a cooling sweetness rather than cloying.

Finish:  Medium length and mouthwatering.  Dominated by toasty maltiness and biscuity shortbread.  The honey lingers for whole time as well, though muted.

Conclusion:  I wasn't completely sure this would be a worthwhile pour at first because I found the nose rather one-dimensional to begin with.  I was definitely wrong!  After delving into this, I found it to be way more complex that I first expected!  What this lack in fruit and spice, it makes up for in a wide variety of biscuity, grainy, buttery notes.  ""One-dimensional"" was not the correct term, it's more like a complex of similar notes."

3.5,"Aberfeldy 12
NOSE: Honeycomb, Vanilla Icing, Ginger, Apple, Orange Creamsicle, Lemon Peel, Musty Wood Spice, and a little Tartness. Very nice!
NEAT: Oak, Vanilla, Sweet Cream, Ginger. Thinnish, but almost effervescent. A whisper of smoke on the finish, but the longer I sip it it develops an astringent note on the finish. Coats the palate with a light smoky vanilla. Almost a creme brûlée. 
SPLASH: A few drops of water changes the creamsicle note to orange oil. Gives the palate a sour note. Much preferable neat. 
VERDICT: This one was the opposite the Glenfiddich 12 for me. That one got better the longer it was in the glass. This one started out better, but became astringent with time in the glass. Still not a bad Single Malt for around $40."

Finish: Some dark notes, but difficult to isolate. Numbs the top of the mouth slightly. Cinnamon? Tough to tell. Definitely a plain Scotch, although in its defense, very mellow and homogeneous."

3.0,"The best way to describe this whisky is “decent.” On the nose, stone fruit, such as peaches, is quite apparent. You also get quite a bit of butterscotch and caramel. On the palate. The warmth is long and slow as it builds. That same fruit comes through, but the butterscotch is more apparent here. It’s quite lush on the palate despite being 40%ABV which is a pet peeve of mine. 40% is the minimum ABV of whisky which means that the second you pour it into a glass, it dips below 40% due to evaporation. Not only that, but you have to finish a glass quite quickly before it starts tasting watered down from the evaporation. That’s why I believe the minimum should be 43% like other Scotches. This being said, however, I quite enjoy this whisky because it handles being at 40% better than other Scotches such as Glenlivet. The other thing is that the finish is quite long. The butterscotch really comes through on the finish and if you’ve ever had Butterbeer (Harry Potter), you’ll notice it quite distinctively on the finish."

Mainstay in Dewars blends and I really like the 12 yr ancestor so high hopes for Aberfeldy 12. Has coloring and only 80pf but.......Poured neat, nose has that Dewars 12 smooth fruit and malt with light smoky vanilla and even some melted butter. Its mild and inviting with ethanol nowhere to be found. Sticky glass coat and soft creamy mouthfeel bring on silky flavors of rich malt, bubble gum,honey drenched bosc pear and golden apple with some more smoky vanilla and oak at back end. Maybe just a flash of peat coffee note in there too. Finish is medium honeyed malt drying to oak with fruit and light smoke. Its not the most complex or powerful single malt but it is absolutely delicious. Its everything good from Dewars12 with none of the grain alcohol harshness or drawbacks. We're talking buttery smooth flavor and supreme drinkability with weight(none of that thin flavor delivery). One of my favorite non peated scotches............90/100.............easy repurchase and guaranteed rotation especially under $40. Blows the doors off the Glens and most of the 10/12 years out there imo...........great beginner scotch! If you like Monkey Shoulder you will like this(its even better)"

This me friends is a good blend / transition of scotch and whiskey without it being overly scotch like and without it being overly Whiskey like. It is a very smooth beverage, neat with overlying warming qualities that you may enjoy responsibility with friends.

The finish is medium and true to these flavor notes. I don't pick up any hint of smoke. This is a great malt and a top pick for me when the price is right. I have been able to get this for $30 lately, but many stores are selling it for $45-50. At that price there are some even better choices to catch my money."

3.0,"Compared to what I expected, a washout loser and only worthy of $20-30 versus the $50+ plus I likely paid for it. This thing has been almost full in my closet for most of my first three years of intensively tasting whiskeys. Why? Generally bland, inoffensive except for the medicinal/alcohol aromatics, little-to-no distinguishing character and too harsh for my high expectations of a 12 year old over $50 USD.

On tasting now, after having tried possibly 80 to 120 whiskies in 3 years, including Scotch and Irish and Canadian and Bourbon, I've raised its rating slightly. But still not worth the price. I feel comfortable having made Rusty Nail cocktails and other mixtures with Drambuie to sweeten it and lower its harshness. 

It's not worth a full delineated review covering nose, taste, appearance, finish. 

Overall: I'm adding an impression of slight sweetness that I've only recently detected. Hence a half point higher than my original assessment. (Had another profile here, it was deleted or is now inaccessible.)"

3.0,"Primarily CARAMEL malts, with a second wave or ORANGE RIND and prickly spices. The salt and peat/smoke are minimal. Toffee and molasses at the front, then a citrus/spicy finish. 

There is a WAXY component that reminds me of those little bulk candy drinks in wax bottles that guy but the end off. (I had a lot of those as a kid because I kept the wax in my mouth to help with a stray wire on my braces. I know you were wondering.) There is a heavy PLASTIC aspect that is very medicinal and Band-Aid-like. 

The warm salt water does start to emerge at the end, really creating a pleasant wash of flavor and smooth texture. This is a whisky that gets better the more you sit with it, if you have the patience."

4.0,"I originally found this on sale back in November and was impressed enough to get a second bottle for thanksgiving, which also received positive reviews from my guests. 

I’ve been wanting to review this for a while, but frankly, it was difficult to improve upon anything Ctrexman wrote about it a few months ago. If you’re interested in this malt I’d recommend looking at his review. 

Aberfeldy is the main distillery that contributes to Dewar’s blended scotches. You can certainly taste its influence in the Dewars 12 and 15 year offerings, but this single malt taste more pure and malty. It is a great scotch to introduce to new whisky drinkers. 

On the nose you can find cream, lime juice, fresh cut grass, lemon zest, and vanilla. 

The main flavor on the palate is similar to the bread you get at a steak house covered in warm honey butter. You can also find caramel and red apples dipped in brown sugar. 

The finish is malty with some dark chocolate tones. This is a very easy to drink and enjoyable scotch. 

You can’t really pigeonhole Aberfeldy into any particular category like a peat monster or sherry, or fruit. I would say it’s best characterized by cream and malt, similar to Deanston but not as thick. It is a really enjoyable malt not quite like anything else."

Taste: white wine grape flavor, raisins, vanilla, Followed by slight oak.

Finalização: curta. Amargor e dulçor combinados é o que fica mais evidente.

Impressões gerais: whisky simples indicado para quem está saindo do mundo dos blends e adentrando o mundo dos single malts. Não é um whisky ruim, mas pode decepcionar quem já está inserido no mundo dos single malts e já degustou um Glenfiddich 15 anos, por exemplo. Ótimo para confraternizações e situações de descontração com os amigos. Preço de prateleira atraente para um single malt."
