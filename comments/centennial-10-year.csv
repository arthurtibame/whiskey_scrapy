2.0,"Smooth with a creamy texture but thin on flavour. Light butterscotch, a hint of floral spice and citrus and fresh oak. Forgettable. $28 in Ontario."
4.0,89/100 for me. Verry smooth flavour winter wheat with a slight white peppery rye. A little light honey to it.  100% Alberta in a bottle. I only wish this was about 46% to get a little more of the flavour profile out of it but its still an excellent whiskey
