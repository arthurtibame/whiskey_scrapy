4.0,Pleasant and easy drinking.  Low lingering burn.
4.25,"Spicy nose...I'm stealing the official tasting notes cause for once I actually got exactly what they are 😊...citrus, butterscotch, oak, this is the best of the US line if you ask me"

4.5,"Neat.  Candy quality to the nose.   Vanilla frosting.  Mint.  Pepper and rye spice.  Super thick, syrupy texture.  Almost reminds me of a maple syrup that has hardened a bit and has crystals of sugar throughout.  Brown sugar and maybe cinnamon initially.  Gives way to the same flavors from the nose - vanilla, hint of mind, pepper and rye spice.  

Quite delightful.  

Did a comparison to the SiB too.  The SiB is very light in terms of the flavor notes by comparison.  The Barrel Strength is a step up in complexity."
4.0,"Very good. Caramel, Vanilla, cotton candy, does not drink 110PF. @ $79 worth the pickup!"

4.5,"one if the finest eyes I've had. buttery, toasty, strong."
5.0,This stuff is amazing. The mouthfeel is so silky...the viscosity of maple syrup. the finish goes on for days. there were two more bottles on the shelf....I'm going to get them...now.
3.25,"111.8 proof. Smells like a room full of barrels. Sharp on the tongue, a cola caramel note mid palate, a rush of spices and slight bitterness at the end. 6/2/19"

4.5,"I am biased because I tend to like most michters products, especially their rye. Very easy drinker for over 110 proof. Notes of dill, and dark fruits. Very unique and tasty"
4.25,Solid spicy rye with a maple-y finish and very little burn for the proof

5.0,"Reviewing Barrel # 19C424. Proof is 108.6.
My experience with Michter's American/Rye/Bourbon is that they are all nice whiskeys but somewhat overpriced and just nothing that stands out. I am always happy to get a pour, but never seem to want to pull the trigger on a bottle. That perception changed when I finally got to taste the 10 yr old Bourbon limited release. That one was really good and definitely worth $90 (if you can ever find it not marked up). Due to that experience I have always kept an eye out for any of their limited expressions. When I finally found this one right at SRP I pulled the trigger as it's really hard to find in my market.
So for background this is a limited annual release from Michter's. It's a single barrel bottled at cask strength so you will see variation in the proofs even with the current year release (105-112). The reason the proof is fairly low for a cask strength is due to Michter's requiring the Distiller to barrel it a relatively low 103 proof (norm is 125). This according to them leads to a richer, smoother whiskey. We should also note that it is chill filtered but not charcoal mellowed. It's sourced from a Kentucky Distillery (they are notorious for being very tight lipped on the source their whiskeys) and is designated as a Straight Rye Whiskey. It's an NAS but with that designation it's at least 2 yrs old. $80 for an NAS Kentucky Rye is a lot of $$. Let's see if this one is actually special (which for that price as an NAS it should be) or if it's just feeding of the hype from Billions (love that show!) On to the tasting:
On the palette what's most striking is how incredibly smooth and rich it is. Whether it's due to the low proof at barreling or not who knows, but it certainly is very smooth and buttery rich. Initial notes are toffee, butterscotch, honey on buttered toast! Sublime! Mid palette add tobacco, oak and an array of wood spices. Finish adds leather, clove and a dash of black pepper and then a length oak char note. Heat finally arrives and it's all on your chest! Lovely, lovely Whiskey. Just to make sure it was as good as I thought, I had a little pour of my WhistlePig SiB also bottled at cask strength and it wasn't in the same ballpark. Michter's just made a previous 5 star Rye taste ordinary. 
More often than not, these overhyped releases fail to come close to living up to your expectations. This time it actually exceeded my expectations. I would go back for another but it sold out in under an hour. So I will just have to nurse this one which will not be easy! 
So in summation, outside of the Saz 17 yr old I can't think of a Rye I have had that was better. 
Cheers all!"

4.75,95/100 on my bottle of 2019.   Best rye I’ve had all year hands down.  A low rye “rye” mash bill gives it the touch of sweetness to compliment the palate.  Beautifully done.   Viscous...long finish...hits all the notes.
3.75,Couldn’t quite place all the profiles but it came out to about  an 89 for me overall.
4.0,Sweet hot nose; brown sugar & spice. A flood of cinnamon and clove opens up to sweeter apple honey and sugar notes that stick around for a while.

4.25,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""whiskey transfer program"".  I liked this a lot and I'm pretty picky on rye.

Nose: Roasted nuts, dark sugars, baking spices, herbal notes like dill, freshly peeled cucumber.

Flavor: More caramelized sugars and baking spices, more freshly peeled cucumber, nice buttery mouth feel.  Not as hot as I'd expect.

Finish: Medium long, spicy, baking spices.

Very straightforward rye with great flavors and an excellent balance of sweet and hot.  Definitely recommend."
5.0,"Taste:  2 oz. neat in glen cairn

Nose: (4.75) Chocolate, cherries, toasted buttered rye bread, red apples, cereal bars, and smoke.  Super luxurious nose.  You smell it, you want to taste it plain and simple.  This is rich.

Palate (5.0):  The apples and brown sugar come through, but then you get a spicy hit.  Allspice perhaps?  That rich dark chocolate is on the back palate along with the cherry.  Reminds me of biting into a chocolate covered cherry cordial.  The mouthfeel is buttery, not coating.  The legs are thick and slow with this one.

Finish: (5.0) Sweet cream butter, chocolate, rye, and a puff of smoke.  The cereal bar on the nose comes in.  There is some well mannered oak too.

Overall:  I have waited to rate this one until now.  It is such an intense and delicious offering at the get go I didn't want to jump to judgement.  The verdict is in.....hands down, if not THE best rye out there.  I still cant decide between this or the Cornerstone Rye.  They are different but the difference is like trying to choose your favorite car between a classic Corvette or a Shelby GT 500.  Different animals, gorgeous in their own right"
4.0,"This is a nice rye whiskey. It is very well balanced and smooth for being barrel strength. Not as complex as Michter's 10 Year Rye but higher proof and only half the price.

Barrel 18F838. Proof 109.4."
