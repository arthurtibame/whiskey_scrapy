3.75,"Honey on the nose. Irish whiskey nose with a little more oak. On the palate, wood, honey, vanilla. Again, reminds of a young Irish whiskey. Smooth. Short finish. Enjoyable."
3.5,"Nose:

Palate: honey"
5.0,If Ireland and Texas had a baby this would be it.  The nose starts off with the Texas burnt molasses and cinnamon but turns into a strong Irish malt nose.  The palate has cinnamon and apples with some pepper on the backend and an A&W’s cream soda finish!!!
3.5,"Nose: cantaloupe at first and vanilla icing after the first few sips

Taste: malty and spicy, finish on the shorter side"
4.0,"Rich, creamy gives way to cinnamon spice. Mellow toasty aftertaste that doesn’t linger too long."
2.75,"Distillery tour today. Andalusia Whiskey Company is located in the beautiful Texas Hill Country about an hour from Austin or San Antonio. They do all their own smoking of their barley, as well as age and bottle on site. Among Texas distilleries, they get a lot of press, and have been featured in Texas Monthly and Whisky Advocate.

This one wasn't terribly interesting. There wasn't anything wrong with it, it was just...there. Not much flavor. Nothing offensive. I will say, the standard version didn't do much for me, but they had a special edition at the distillery finished in a PX cask and served at cask strength that was considerably better. Really brought out some more of the subtle notes in this one."
3.75,"This is the closest to Irish whiskey that I have had in the US. Taste is a bit young, but as smooth as any decent Irish whiskey. Price per bottle is not in keeping with it’s pedigree... price would be more ideal at $40.  Love the idea of supporting a local distillery, especially one venturing outside the norm, but at $60/bottle, you are in Red Breast territory."
