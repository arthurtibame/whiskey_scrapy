There’s not much on the nose, but the initial taste is much creamier than I would have expected from a 5-year old.  There are some nice vanilla and apricot flavours against a spicy, oaky background.  

There’s also a slightly odd gin hint in this one.  Not strongly, but it has some in there.  

Overall, not bad.  I’d certainly try others in their range and it’ll be interesting to see how it ages."
