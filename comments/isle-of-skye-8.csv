3.0,"A good introduction into peat. If you like JW Black, definitely try this blend. I'll be using this for my scotch cocktails. A steal for the price."

4.0,"Nose- surprisingly light fragrance of vanilla with very little trace of peat
Body- bright and hot mouthfeel but crisp as easy to drink (especially at 8 years)
Finish- clean and short 
Note- although lacking in complexity, this was a very like able scotc when desiring something light yet flavorful."
2.0,"Yes, there's that distinct flavour of Skye/Talisker, but it's all compromised by the brutally young age and all the unpolished notes of chalk, celery and yeast that comes with it -- which is hopelessly being masked by artificial caramel-y painfully sweet flavours."

3.5,"When I first tasted this, it had an overpowering artificial smoke flavor tacked on to an inoffensive blend. As it evolved, it began to taste like a more refined Johnnie Walker Red. Now, it has mellowed out to a noticeably smoky blend with little in the way of harshness, and a decent warming heat. The smoke and speyside flavors are not fully integrated, but it can be forgiven. Nice enough to drink as a sipper, and an absolute steal at the price point."
4.0,"Honeyed malt comes through, with moderate peat, has a soft mouth-feel, which I think means a high proportion of malt in the blend. This reminds me of Johnny Walker Black, but I prefer this. Not as complex as an 12-16 yr old single malt finished in sherry casks. But if you want your Scotch to display it's natural maltiness with a full flavor and a rather long smooth finish, this Scotch blend could be for you. And, yes, I only drink it neat."
