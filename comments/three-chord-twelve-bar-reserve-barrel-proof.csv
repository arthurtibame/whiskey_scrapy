4.5,"The nose has balanced and pleasant notes of maple, caramel, vanilla, with a touch of salt, grapefruit and oak. The palate opens with salted caramel on top of maple and vanilla, and is very mouth coating, with touches of oak and pepper coming out. The finish is long and peppery with fading oak and caramel. Delicious."
3.75,"Decided to give this one a go to support home state distillers. At least the bottle looks cool so it has that going for it. Nose is very sweet almost like fresh pecan sticky buns. First sip is heavy on brown sugar and vanilla with a slight rye character. Surprisingly smooth for such a strong proof. Price is a bit too high on this one as it doesn't hold up against ECBP, but it is a nice entry from a newer distillery."
3.75,Definitely improved as it breathed!

4.5,"Surprisingly good. A viscous, rich caramel bomb that is probably worth $60-$65.  As someone who prefers a less spicy bourbon, I like this better than ECBP.  I haven't had the standard Three Chord, but this is a great barrel proof offering that is perfect at it's 107 proof"
