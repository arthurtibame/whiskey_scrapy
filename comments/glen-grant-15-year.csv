4.0,True speyside. The smell has nice oak with a slight apple. Taste has an oak forward finish that is slightly oily. A couple drops of water opens it up. The salt air is easily found with some pepper on the finish.

3.25,"Sweet on the nose.  Tastes hotter than the 100 proof beat, but with an ice cube that mellows out and is pretty good."

3.0,"Tastes this when my palate was pretty wrecked. Don’t get much from the nose but might benefit from a better glass. The taste has an early bite of citrus that fades quickly to a warm woody flavor and finished with spiced fruit. 

Would not push a glass away if it was poured for me but don’t think I will get another bottle."
4.25,"Moderately sweet on the nose, with vanilla and red fruit and brown sugar. Warm and sweet taste. Long, pleasantly warm lingering finish. Underrated wonderful Scotch."
4.25,"The nose is lovely with honeydew melon, vanilla, oak, wood smoke, and custard. Taste is strong pepper, with some cream soda, and a creme brulee with a burnt sugar crust. Finish is smooth, long, with vanilla, oak, and barrel char. Great! Although the alcohol can be a bit nippy at times, it still beats the standard bottle offerings."

4.0,"Nose: honey, fruit and light baking spices 
Palate: spice cake with light fruit 
Finish: medium finish with a hint of Grandmas fruit cake
Overall:Terrific Single Malt for the price. Glen Grant to me is a hidden gem within the single malt scotch category. Complex yet smooth, a terrific dram! Cheers 🥃!!"

4.0,"If I were a teacher and the various Scottish distilleries whose products I’ve tried were my students, Glen Grant would be a strong contender for the title of “Most Improved Student.” Their old lineup - Major’s Reserve, 10 Year, and 16 Year were underwhelming (though I never had a chance to try the 16, so maybe it was the exception). Their new portfolio is MUCH nicer; the 12 runs laps around the 10, the 18 is lovely, and this 15 year is maybe the best of the lot. The nose is pure fruit basket and American oak; after a BIG initial burst of sweet coconut and vanilla, a plethora of ripe fruits turn up - banana, pear, apple, pineapple, guava, even a little mango. To spice things up, candied ginger and white pepper notes turn up after a little bit of time in the glass. The palate is delightfully round and full, balancing nicely the influence of the oak and the light, fruity nature of the Glen Grant spirit. This dram manages to find a perfect, and difficult, balance between freshness and substance. The finish is long and lingering as that sweet oakiness just keeps on going. There’s a bit of burn, but for a higher abv bottling it’s really not too bad. This is a great dram, especially for a sub-$70 bottle. Let’s hope that the folks in the stillhouse at Glen Grant keep on this path!"

3.5,"- Sem filtragem gelada	
- Não declara se tem corante ou não mas se houver é bem pouco	
- Whisky exclusivo para venda no mercado norte americano	
- First fill bourbon cask	

Olfato: Baunilha, dulçor, malte, cítrico de laranjas e pêras e um pouco de maçãs verdes. Leve amadeirado, frutado de frutos tropicais - senti algo que lembra mamão - e uma pimentinha que é realçada pela presença robusta do álcool. 

Palato: amadeirado, dulçor bem balanceado com um bom amargor, baunilha, cítrico, levemente salgado, boa oleosidade, apimentado realçado pelo grande impacto do álcool. 

Finalização: média para curta. Quente, com amargor, dulçor, amadeirado e malte revezando dentro da boca.

Impressões gerais: um whisky com ótimo preço e ABV honesto, no entanto o álcool é muito pronunciado para um whisky de 15 anos. É possível encontrar whiskies de 10 ou 12 anos com graduação alcoólica próxima - com ABV entre 46% e 48% - e com aroma de álcool praticamente imperceptível. Um whisky de 15 anos deveria ser bem menos “crespo” do que pude observar nesta garrafa. No demais, possui todas as belas características que alguém procura em um whisky envelhecido em barris de ex-bourbon de primeiro uso, boa oleosidade, dulçor, além notas amadeiradas e frutadas características desta madeira. O preço é ótimo e é possível encontrá-lo em alguns free shops ou vendedores online. Recomendo a degustação com uma boa esfera de gelo ou algumas gotas de água para suavizar o impacto do álcool que é bem pronunciado nesta versão 15 anos da Glen Glant."

2.5,"Nose - vanilla, pears and oranges. There are spices, and a bit of an alcohol kick for 50%.  The oak is giving off some toffee notes and perhaps even a bit of an oat note. More citrus and oak forward overall. 

Taste - The flavor is much more vanilla and cereal grains with the fruit notes becoming a bit more oak tannin and bitter. This however gives way to a nice oaky and vanilla finish that lingers medium long (pretty good for a 15 year). Water really opens this up, brings out more of the fruits, pulls back the tannins and takes some of the bitter off.

This is really nicely done whisky. If you'd told me there was a very small portion of this in ex sherry casks I might have believed it, instead it's all ex bourbon and it's very good.

I forget the price, I want to say 80ish and at that price it's getting difficult for me to recommend, but I'd still consider it a good pour.  2.25, it's a great whisky for ex bourbon cask lovers and it's got enough extra to push it past just being a whisky for that profile only. I also am digging the finish...actually I'm pushing it to 2.5 as the finish is on par with some 21 year olds I've had.

The reason this isn't getting into the 3's as I realize I've been writing a love fest relatively speaking is that it's overly drying and that's taking away from my overall enjoyment. It however needs that abv as that's really helping with the mouth feel and giving it a creamy coating."
