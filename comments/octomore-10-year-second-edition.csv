4.5,"This smells somewhat sweet in a meaty way and also richly woody. There's a lot of salt on the nose and also some char and chocolate, along with a hint of dark fruit. It smells complex and interesting. It's rich with lots of peat and smoke, giving it a meaty iodine taste with some hints of dark berry sweetness it's quite good. The finish is rich and grainy with creamy dark chocolate notes. Adding water, the tobacco element of the peat is there, but the creamy chocolate is also white present.combining the grain flavor, there is a bit of a custard hint. It reminds me of my first impressions of Laphroaig 10. It's sweet enough and brings in some oil and sweet nuttiness (almond). The flavor could use a bit more fruit at this point but it still works well. The spices and herbal flavors aren't absent, but they take a back seat. It's quite hedonistic, but not terribly complex. This is a quite tasty scotch that is thoroughly enjoyable, though not a masterpiece."

5.0,Wonderful!  The first thing that you notice in the room is the smell of sweet bonfire smoke.  The first sip brings the smoke along with sweet BBQ ribs done to perfection along with toffee and hints of honey.  The warmth the spreads working the deepest parts of one’s being.
4.75,Wonderful warmth of honey spreading down to the chest.  The peat is there but less pronounced than what I expected.  Top marks

4.5,"rich and full of flavour, salty after taste, adding water releases nice smells"
4.25,"Sherry, cinnamon on the nose with of course a salty peat.  Pepper too.  Sweet toffee followed by the sherry and a smoky oak.  Aftertaste is dominated by toffee and peat."

5.0,"* The last of 6 tasting notes from the Sydney Bruichladdich masterclass, 19 Feb 18.

Nose: Rich leathery and earthy peat smoke.  Softly oily and embracing.  A cloud of evocative smoke that, enveloping as it is, cannot hide aromas of orange and lemon peel, apples, peaches, apricots, toffee, tobacco and ocean breakers. Beautiful oak notes that lend a touch of vanilla.

Palate: Initially dry like a crisp dry white wine, then suddenly sweet citrus flavours come rolling in on briny vapours like a surfer riding a glistening arc of smoke.  Lime, grapefruit, lemon, sweet persimmon, cantaloupe, mango, and white grapes. Licorice and salmiak. I agree with the official tasting notes here - this is a complex, ever-changing palate.

Finish: Long. Very long. Floral, fruity, slightly briny and fading out eventually on sweetly gentle smoke with a touch of earthy oak, and leaving an aftertaste that lasts literally hours.

Despite the mad peating level of the barley, by the time most Octomores make it into the glencairn the nose has tamed down a good deal, to the point that they smell less peated than many whiskies that only declare a level of around 40ppm. However this is different. This smells and tastes quite definitely of peat smoke, but the smoke is held in check by the softening of expert wood maturation. It's not as ""sharp"" as the typical Octomore smoke, it's soft but full - more like Benromach smoke.

I am overjoyed that this whisky exists. Given that peat smoke decreases quickly with age it would be tempting for Bruichladdich to release everything very young so their peat monster was always as vigorous as possible. However this whisky proves that not only can Octomore withstand 10 years in ex-white wine barrels, it benefits from the treatment. The strange thing is that even though the peating level should logically be reduced compared with the 5 year matured expressions, it somehow seems to be enhanced by the extra time in casks.  Maybe they use a very aggressive char? Maybe it's just the combination so that in comparison with younger Octomores this *seems* to be smokier. Either way it is certainly a sweeter, rounder, more subtle and sophisticated type of smoke.

I've tasted 6 Octomores now, including this one (6.1, 6.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3) and I have a sample of 5.1 waiting in the cupboard to try some time. I've not tried any of the 8 series, but of all those I've tried so far this was my favourite. Maybe I just don't like Octomore quite so ""raw"" and prefer the softening that 10 years brings.  Whatever the reason, I recommend this heartily, and it's the first Octomore I've given 5 stars. Welcome to the top shelf, if I can find a bottle.

""Outstanding"" : 5 stars"

5.0,"The Octomore 10 (2nd edition) is with 167ppm a real peat monster. Presented right after the 169pp Octomore 7.3 at a Bruichladdich Masterclass, it appeared to be a tad smoother, and somewhat sweeter, but that’s not a minus, really.
The extra five years of maturation tempers the smoke a bit, and the partial maturation in white wine cask is quite obvious, and certainly adds some tropical, fruity tones. Both the nose and the palate are pretty impressive and complex, and make it really hard to choose between this one and the 7.3… 
Actually, I’d take either one of these, any time, without any hesitation… :)"
