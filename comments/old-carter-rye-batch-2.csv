4.5,"Nose- Maple, buttery pie crust, caramel, brown sugar, cardamom, cinnamon 

Palate- Baking spices, dusty oak, cinnamon, peaches, pecans, caramel

Finish- Long, drying and spicy finish with notes of pecans, baking spices, and dusty, aged oak

This is a big hitter. Bold and spicy although out. Wonderful, rye forward nose. Notes of maple and buttered pie crust keep it balanced with some sweetness. The palate is unmistakably a rye. Baking spices, aged dusty oak, and caramel for days. Nice long finish to wrap things up for this impressive, bold and tasty rye."
