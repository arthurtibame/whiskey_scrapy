3.0,Irish Whiskey  single malt bit harsh like most of these whiskey single malts
4.0,"I'll admit I've never even heard of Locke's, but it's pretty outstanding.  A lot in common with DoubleWood, with honey being prominent.  Sweet peach and ripe melon present too.  I don't get the peat yet the finish is rich, if not quite as heavy as DW."

3.5,"Big shot of vanilla on the nose.

Tasted with an ice-cube, lots of spice first, followed by sweet notes and a barest hint of smoke on the finish. I wouldn't say it's very complex, but it is very enjoyable."
1.5,Smokey the Bear is offended by this peaty mess
