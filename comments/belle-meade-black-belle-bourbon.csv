4.75,"One of the best Belle Meade releases I've ever tasted. Perfectly blended between the nice low barrel proof of the Bourbon with the flavor of the stout beer. Neither is over powering, and complex flavors of caramel, chocolate, and oak spice. Medium-Long finish with a nice warmth. Virtually no ethanol burn."
