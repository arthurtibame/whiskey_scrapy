3.75,"The Senator is an annual limited release of a 6 yr old MGP Rye (95/5) bottled at Cask Strength (112.1). Let's dive into the tasting...

It enters rich with a punch of brown sugar and vanilla... Candied ginger and a hint of mint follow... Baking spices then kick in before the butterscotch sprinkled in cinnamon driven finish... It's a touch hot for the proof and I found pouring it on a big rock was just perfect. Smoothed it out and brought the big sweet notes to the forefront!

Really enjoying this one and sad it's very limited! 

Cheers All!!"
