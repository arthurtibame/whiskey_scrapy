4.25,Store pick. Should have bought 3 or 4. Delicately sweet and perfectly blended. Loved this neat!
5.0,"Ok so for sure it’s a sherry bomb... but it’s incredibly smooth (and at 103 proof) a little hot on the tongue. The character is complex and definitely bottle-worthy. If you can find this, and you love sherry casks, get yourself a bottle or two."

This is a sherry bomb from nose to finish. I enjoyed the retail version at 90 proof, but its sherry influence is more restrained than this Select Cask. The bourbon takes a back seat."
