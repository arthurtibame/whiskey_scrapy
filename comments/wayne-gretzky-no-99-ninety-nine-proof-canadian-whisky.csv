2.75,"Perplexing.
Some sweetness to it. Can taste red wine (maybe) in there and some caramel hints. Smokey. Rubbery? I find the flavors elusive. Quite prominent one sip, but hidden behind a fairly potent alcohol burn on the next sip.
Feels like it has potential. Maybe needs more time."

Meaty stuff. Bourbon palate and long rye finish."

3.75,"First sip gave me tingles all over my body! I tasted sweet notes I had never tasted before in a whisky. It feels thick in my mouth. It’s quite enjoyable really. Besides the price, the only thing that is not enjoyable is the nose. It just leaves something to be desired. It really missing the same notes as the palette."

4.25,Wouldn’t believe it’s 99 proof... great flavour.
4.0,"This is a tasty, punchy whisky alright. The Demerara flavour is more suggestive of bourbon than rye at first taste, but then the astringent spice of cloves and later drying black licorice come through on the finish. The proof is unequivocal too, backing up the chunky palate. Not to be trifled with."

4.0,"Certainly, my favourite of the three released. Full, rich, a little spice, but something else. Grape jelly? Something rich, sweet, and a little oily. This is worth trying and would make a flavourful mix if neat is not your thing."

3.0,"Favorite of the three. more oak than I expected, and not much burn for a 99 proof."
4.0,"I love Canadian whisky, second only to Irish, and this is an excellent example. A deep, inviting rusty bronze and a boozy, sherried, faintly tangerine nose tempt the first sip. At 49.5%, it shouldn’t be as potent as it is. A few drops of water bring out satisfying a malty rye spices, a nice bit of corn sweetness, and a long fruitcake finish. At $100/litre in duty free, it’s pricy for a NAS Canadian, and not as good VFM as, say, cask strength Lot 40 or Pike Creek 21. Still, it’s as Canadian as, well, Wayne Gretzky and a damn fine dram."
