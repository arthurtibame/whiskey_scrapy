3.25,"Batch 20, Barrel 36, Bottle 84.  4yr6mo

4-Grain: 68% rye, 8% wheat, 12% malted barley, 12% corn.

Verdict:  Very smooth, nothing harsh, just doesn’t hit on the flavors.  Feels disjointed and lacking.  Seems a shame to relegate a craft single barrel to cocktails but probably won’t finish this one as a sipper alone.

Light reddish-gold honey color.  Relatively thin.  Widely-spaced legs.

Simple, singular note on the nose, but pleasant.  Very sweet honeyed vanilla with a hint of cherry and you get the feeling that it wants to show its fruitful side, but there is an overriding deafening note that I just can’t place.  It just smells flat 5 times out of 6, like the higher frequencies have been removed.  Unfortunate, as the rest is very nice.  Perhaps an uncooked grain, lacking the cereal sweetness.

Thin mouthfeel.  A similar flatness shows itself immediately on the tongue.  Like the flavor of a mouthful of oil... just neutral.  Cardboard bland, then slowly replaced with a gentle minty sweetness, like the reside of a recently finished breath mint.  Some black pepper and a mild, meaty nut flavor, like an almond or chestnut. A quick sip highlights the mint much more strongly and allows it to enjoyably fill the mouth.  The bottle claims a cedar note that I think I can get onboard with.

Finish is relatively long and pleasant and may be where this one shines the best, in competition with the (more) delightful but incomplete nose."

4.5,"Very Unique tasting. Almost Rye whiskey is similer or MGP. But it has own charactor.

Noses are sweet but palette is different. Spicy as like a black pepper, sweetness, after tasting, you can feel earthy after rain-sweat soil.

It has a charactor, and special identity. It may not best Rye, but it’s unique"
