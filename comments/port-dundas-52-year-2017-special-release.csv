4.75,"At $980, this is worth every penny and then some. You will never find a more pleasant single grain scotch.

There is only one word necessary to describe the full experience of this whisky: butterscotch.

The coconutty aroma introduces you to the fact that you're soon to experience something you'll never have again.

The palate is delicious, full of butterscotch, vanilla, comfort-food like dessert flavorings.

The finish, honestly, tough to remember. I wanted more palate. At only 752 bottles in existence, however, discipline ordered me to put it back on my shelf for another day. Do not drink this whisky after drinking anything else. What you do after drinking it is on you, but this is a standalone masterpiece."
