4.25,"Nice and rich, light oak and grain flavors coming through, with some salt. More complex than the base version, and much heavier than what I'm used to out of Japan. Great balance between the flavors, despite the high proof making it a bit aggressive."

4.0,"Back as a grad student in Chemical Engineering, I spent a research semester in Paris.  One thing I immediately noticed is that the European students don’t come out with massive student debt as the Americans.  In fact, they don’t come out with any debt.  They have just as good of a college education, minus the $30k-50k / yr tuition.  Instead, they pay barely $5k. Why is that?  Well...their universities aren’t massive complexes with acres of green space; they don’t have stadiums that hold 80,000 people; they don’t have ultra-fancy dorms and gyms that can go toe-to-toe with a NYC condominium; they don’t have cafeterias that make a Portland food truck scene green with envy.  You get the point.  

So there comes this blended Japanese whiskey.  Barely $50.  Just as good as good as the fancier Japanese whiskies that come with engraved bottles, beautiful models holding it for Instagram worthy poses ( I’m looking at you Dekanta), and fancy Japanese hieroglyphics all over the wooden boxes.  It offers up aromas of delicate flowers: think hyacinths and peonies.  Probably from the grain?  Palette is a bit more of darker fruits.  Some sherry finished malt?  

Either way...damn good for a $50 Japanese whiskey.  It’s been ages since I’ve opened anything new ( my buddies @LeeEvolved, @Telex, @Generously_Paul, @dubz480,and @Scott_E , @Richard-ModernDrinking ) have kept me supplied with a plethora of samples).  I don’t think you can find this in the US or EU/UK...but if you see it for $50, grab it."
