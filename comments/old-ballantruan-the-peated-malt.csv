3.5,The smokey peated taste with a slight hint of honey and a mild salty aftertaste.
5.0,"Oh this is Heavily peated. Very pleasant. Instantly made my top 5 whiskies so far. Im a peat head. 

On the nose, as soon as you open the bottle you get that peaty aroma. After pouring it on the glass you will have to dodge that intense peatiness (which is wonderful) to get some citrus notes as lemon and oranges. There is something floral in there too.

On the palate is quite pleasant. Full bodied, eventhough it is bottled at 50%abv you dont need water to taste it, since it is sweet with a very very small hotiness, with intense peat aty the finish which is medium-long. Almonds and nuts are present, oakyness, and peat. I really really really enjoyed it, it is less than 10 years old, but oh boy it is lovely"

3.0,"Strong maltiness and nuttiness in nose. Strong , malty, dense smoke in taste. Piercing alcohol finish. I would add some sweet character in it, or enjoy it with a Cuban"

4.0,Speyside but peaty
3.0,"Peaty and spicy, bringing together a nice sharpness along with the smokiness. Not overly complex but it might be hidden by the strong notes."
4.0,Light elements of peat. Forward mouthfeel.

4.0,"Oct 2019.
Clear medium gold.
Aromatic plum, brine, ripen critrus, smoky pomelo and overcooked egg white in nose.
Warm rich smoky malt biscuits, brine, iodine, and a little sweet vanilla in the aftertaste.
Good balance peated malt finish."

4.0,"A little less passionate compared to the extraordinary 10 y.o. version. 
To the nose: heavy peat, many fresh notes and orange peel.
The taste is same - very peated; pleasantly sweet on the edges of the tongue, some citrus, deep smoked barley; but somewhat pale relatively to the 10 years version.
Finish is decent - smoky, mouthfilling, “oily”; there is some barley too.
It seemed to be very likely to Ledaig 10 y.o.
The second tasting reveals much more mature and sweeter nature (same bottle, after 2 months since opening - does not seem to deteriorate). Cool.
With a touch of water it gives you some more citrus and cream. Well-deserved 4."
