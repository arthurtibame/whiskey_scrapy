4.0,Alright but not too great
4.0,"Appearance: This unique craft whiskey is a darker copper color with thick watery legs making their way down the inside of the glass after a little swirl.

Nose: The nose overall is sweet and nutty with definite sherry influence. Tantalizing your nasal cavity are notes of caramel, vanilla, honey, walnuts and almonds, hay and straw, strawberry yogurt, plum, and a slight varnish. I also got a reminiscence of my dad’s Thanksgiving pecan pie with notes of pecans, cinnamon, and buttery bread. I could sniff on this all day!

Taste: The palate is fruity and subtle yet complex. Detectable notes for me consisted of cherry, raspberry, green apple, snickerdoodle cookie, a dry maltiness, and dark chocolate.

Finish: There is a finish of medium length that leaves a sweet and lingering memory. 

Thoughts: This whiskey has jumped through a lot of hoops and legal / political hurdles, but according to Victor, Master Distiller up at Black Bear, it is the first legal whiskey of its kind. This American tribute to the style of Irish whiskey has won many awards and has won my taste buds over to its side as well! I highly recommend getting a bottle if you can, and will definitely be getting this again! Thanks, Victor! Sláinte!"
