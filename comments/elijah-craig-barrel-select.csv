4.5,"Sugary oak nose, high alcohol. Tastes of sweet cinnamon spice candies, somewhat oily. There is a lot to like about this whiskey."

4.25,"ThatBourbondude just came back from a whirlwind tour of Elijah Craig Country. Yesterday, as we're tasting through some new Bourbons in the conference room, he whips out this gem. This bourbon encompasses all of those EC traits including sweet caramel toffee with notes of sweet roasted oak. Long finish, very little overpowering heat. Love this bourbon! My taste profile!"
4.5,"Thank Steve for a sample pour of this awesome one. Very flavorful bourbon for 125 proof. Initial heat goes away quick followed by brown sugar, cinnamon and slight chocolate. Dangerously drinkable."
4.75,This is some seriously good stuff. Smells of brown sugar with a hint of chocolate and marshmallow. Hints of honey and maple syrup. Strong taste of wood and sourdough. This has got some fangs.
