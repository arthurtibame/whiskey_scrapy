4.0,"I love Glendronach. Along with Laphroaig it's my favourite distillery. Initially when I tried this along with a dozen or so other whiskies including Glendronach 14 year Virgin oak (which most thought probably best whisky of the night and they demolished the bottle!) I didn't think it was a stand out. The flavour profile seemed muted. Now I've allowed it to breathe for a while its opened up. Honey, apricot, vanilla and green apples come through with that familiar Glendronach spicy viscosity. I now rate this a 3.75 so given the price point at just over $60USD I'll round this this to a 4."
