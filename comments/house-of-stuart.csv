2.25,Actually better than I thought it would be. I’ve been buying a good single malt like Aberfeldy 12 or Glenmorangie and then I buy a cheap bottom shelf because of a friend mixes coke with all his whiskey. To hell I say not my single malt!! But I always sip some straight. I was like this ain’t bad it isn’t great either but in a pinch I can drink and it’s damn good for mixing! It’s smooth it’s drinkable but isn’t anywhere close to good single malts. It’s Great and a bargain for friends that’s gotta ruin good scotch with coke.
