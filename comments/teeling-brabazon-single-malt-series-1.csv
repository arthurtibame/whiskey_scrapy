4.0,"What do you do when having an existential crisis at 1 am and not being able to sleep? You replan your entire appartment, and drink some irish whisky. The last Teeling I had was amazing, and this is not far off too. On the nose I get honey, peaches, some apricot, hints of citrus hovering above that, and some kind of sour note that reminds me of fresh sourdough bread with plum jam. On the taste is has the typical irish barley notes with some vanilla, on top of some cooked dark fruits with spices in them and some honey hazelnut crunch scattered over it. Very lovely. That's a whisky that invites you to dream and let your mind wander. The spicy sweet aftertaste takes a while to fade and slowly leads you back into the land of the living. Good stuff."

The next two days will be far too busy, so I spent a good chunk of time in the kitchen prepping our annual feast- salad, roast duck, root vegetables cooked in the duck fat, and rice pudding. Now that the food's eaten, the dishes washed, and the presents opened, I find a quiet moment for the penultimate dram in my Advent calendar. And, it is no slouch. I am greeted by a rich nose, itself a feast: toasted brioche, vanilla creme patissiere, lightly toasted almond, apricot glaze. The palate is warming rather than hot, with the initial attack of fruit compote opening into vanilla and almond pastry sprinkled lightly with cinnamon and nutmeg. The ending lingers, vanilla and spice along with a bit of spirit-y heat. To all a good night indeed!"

3.0,"hellbräunliche Farbe mit fruchtigen und süßlichen Noten im Geruch. im Geschmack nussig fruchtig aber sehr sanft. dann verbreitet sich eine herzhafte Kombination aus Holz, dunklen Früchten und Nuss im Mund aus. diese Kombi bleibt lange and intensiv. Im Abgang dann herzhaft fruchtig."
