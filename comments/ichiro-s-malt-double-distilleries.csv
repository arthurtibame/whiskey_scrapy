4.25,"A bit unbalanced due to the new whisky in the blend. Alcohol comes forward but it balances off quite well with the addition of a little water! Loads of spices, sweet and cake. Long aftertaste but alcohol still bites a bit"
3.5,"I really quite liked their wine finish and it scored a very good 4 rating from me.

This one is back down to more solid territory. Its youngish side shows more prominently without the extra finishing to mask the youth of the distillate.

Lovely vanilla slight green apple."

4.25,"Nose - Fruity vanilla, honey, baked light fleshed stone fruits, sweet baked croissants, apricot glaze

Taste - Fruity vanilla & honey, light bitter/ginger heat, sweet baked stone fruits, baked apples, light fruity bitter apple skin

Finish - Lingering sweet heat, baked apples and light fleshed stone fruits

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - This fits right in with the typical Japanese profile of being nicely balanced and not too punchy. It tastes a bit young but not overly so. Nice balance of mouthfeel but has a bit of fruity bitterness that sort of builds with each subsequent sip. Is a very nice fruity/summery vibe to it with the baked apples and light fleshed stone fruits (peaches/nectarines/apricots).

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe another if it was"

4.5,"Interesting expression with notes of honey, apples, sandalwood, and ginger. Least favorite of the Ichiro's Malt Pure Malt leaf series as ginger overpowers many flavors."

4.0,Honey cereals on the nose and the honey follows through on the palate. A rare treat. The finish is oaky and rather medium with a tiny tad of burn (or was that the spice ?) nice
