3.0,"I received this as a gift. I believe it’s one of Total Wine & More’s Spirits Direct offerings. Neat, there’s a very nice flavor, with brown sugar prominent. On the rocks, it looses that flavor and becomes a bit harsh."
3.5,"The nose is Caramel, oak, followed by brown sugar and cinnamon.  
 The tastes starts out sweet with the flavor of honey  and Vanilla, some oak and corn, followed by heat on the way down. 
I paid $35 for this and thought that it was a little high for this Bourbon, I would think $19 would be a better value, anything more I feel you are getting demising returns on your money. If you like sweet bourbon you will like Hickory Hill. My overall thought was that it is middle of the road, it’s not the best I had and it’s certainly not the worst. But I can honestly say I don’t think I will buy a second bottle, because there are a ton of other better Kentucky bourbon’s at this price point or lower. 
This Bourbon is from a Distillery called Golf Coast Distillers, and there website can be found here: http://www.gulfcoastdistillers.com/hickory-hill-kentucky-straight-bourbon/. But there is not much information on this Bourbon as to where it’s actually distilled and aged. I am betting it’s sourced from another distiller in Kentucky."
