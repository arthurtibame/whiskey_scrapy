4.0,"sensory experience as you drink it, like a firework went off in your mouth, but in a great way"
5.0,Strong nose. Light maple. Caramel?
4.5,"Nose- Peaches in syrup; strawberries; vanilla; gingerbread; almonds; dark chocolate; coconut 

Palate- Initial wave of green apples; icing sugar; mangoes; earthy spice; sea salt; walnuts; hazelnuts; sherry sweetness

Finish- Long, creamy finish; Coconuts; sea spray; dark chocolate; tropical fruits


Man. Black arts never disappoints. My only complaint is that it’s not the most complex and mysterious dram in the world. Compared to the 4.1, the “mystery” just isn’t there. Still, this has an incredible nose, the palate is fantastic, and the finish is long and enjoyable. Loads of fresh berries and tropical fruits throughout, with hints of nuts and sherry as well. I don’t get much oak, which saddens me for a 26 year old. All in all, great dram, but could be better in a couple areas"
4.5,"This is a unique experience. It's very rich with smoke, but also sweet with apricot and toffee. For an unpeated whiskey, the richness is impressive. Not as strong as Laphroaig, but that's both fine and reasonable. The finish is delightful in it's perfect balance, which is a feat that only the best drinks manage. The nose is rich, smoky, and fruity with caramel in a great scotch manner. There is some rich chocolate in here, that is mixed with numerous other flavors. The spices are varied and hard to place. The little bit of stale bread that is present is rises up briefly and then fades into the tapestry of other flavors that make this drink a delight. The complexity is thorough and it dances well with the richness. The marriage of flavors is impressive. The fruitiness is varied and delightful, but combined with the smoke, wood, and other flavors it comes out balanced and delightful. There's a little bit of that coconut flavor that indicates age in here. The drink might be a bit mild for its age, but all of the flavors are great or better. It's sort of like Highland Park 18 meets Highland Park Valkyrie meets Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or meets Bushmill's 21. It's really good.
Smoke, sea spray, salt, sweetness. There is some citrus fruit that tends toward the astringent side and there are also some minerals. Caramel comes through too with cocoa and and coffee. There are ginger, cinnamon, and clove hints to it but they don't make it terribly spicy. There's a ton of complexity in here but is it really worth the price?
The nose is mellow and rounded with definite smokiness and sea spray. The palate has a bit of mineral, but it isn't too bad. The sea and smokiness come out immediately, but there is something rich and mellow backing them. There's a little bit of odd soapiness going on here that reminds me of orange and tangerine with with a spicy bitter burn. The flavor is very good with tons of complexity, but the soap is a bit much. A bigger sip bring sour some nice red fruit flavors like plum and a smaller bit of cherry, as well as hints of almond skins and pecan. The rich bitterness is tasty but it's a bit much and does not quite have the strength to suggest a 26 year drink (it's more int the 21 year range). This is reminiscent of a sweeter Glenfarclas 25, but it isn't quite as good and costs a ton more."

4.75,"No water
Very sweet on the nose, hardly any ethanol
Dark fruit is obvious on the taste
Something else is presenting, maybe sherry cask?
A very easy sip, delicious, a definite buy"
5.0,So much going on. Too many to list. Prominent flavors of coconut and licorice. Mind blowing experience.
5.0,"I have been waiting several years to finally try this whisky. There was something about the bottle that simply seduced me. Let me get things straight: I HATE BRUICHLADDICH THE CLASSIC LADDIE, but this one i wanted to try. The price people asked for this is ridiculous and that is why i have never tried it before. The Bruichladdich 26yo Black art from 1990, lived to its expectations and i discover some things on it that made this dram special. Its one of 18.000 bottles, and Adam, the master distiller is allegedly the only one who knows what its the cask type on this baby.

Bottled at 46.9%abv.

On the nose, it is SUPER COMPLEX, but let me start by telling you that i hated the ""Classic Laddie"" because it had a flavor and aroma of Soap, Shampoo and those chinese rice gums. Well, the VERY FIRST AROMA NOTE I GOT WAS.... Soap. Lol!.

But then, the complexity appeared and the journey started. Sugar, Coffee, Toasted notes. Shampoo but a looooot better than the classic laddie. Creme brulee/toasted caramel, Dry grass; It still has the soap notes like washing your hands, but with some coffee infused foam. After first sip, the nose gave me a super chocolate-Thick note. 

On the palate, it is one great dram. Delicious Chocolate, Some grassy spiciness coming up. Oranges. Amazing dram with Brown sugar notes. Very rewarding. 

The aftertaste feels like bonfire where you have burnt dry grass; ginger madness. Beautiful dram. Dry grassy finish. 

Let this whisky breath, it is totally worth it.

Overall,  this is exactly what people say and brag about. My score for it is 99/100. Remarkable."

4.5,"Un nez très profond, avec de la vanille, beaucoup de bois et de xérès, des fruits confits... Un superbe nez.
L'attaque est douce et monte bien en bouche, dans un bel équilibre. Des arômes de vieux bois bien maitrisés, tout sur le sherry, on aime ça.
La finale est très longue sur l'abricot séché, surtout dans la bouche, superbe.
Un très bon whisky oui, mais à qui il manque un petit quelque chose pour devenir mémorable et qui, pour moi, ne vaut pas son prix exorbitant (40€/dram)."
