4.25,Great spice followed by sugar cookie and a long finish.  I can’t get enough of this stuff right now.
4.0,"This is a sharp, highly aromatic rye with a grassy, spicy character true to its Pennsylvania style roots. A cube brings out a bit of dill pickle and faintly peaty smoke, which, while sounding a bit odd is actually quite interesting. Hardcore Penn rye lovers should be entranced, but this is an acquired taste, for sure. I love it!"

3.5,Smooth. Slightly pulpy / barley taste.
3.75,"N: Dill and cedar
P: Cornbread into a pleasant baking spice
F: Spicy oak that gives a nice Kentucky hug. Minty fresh finish to the finish."
3.75,"N: Freshly opened bag of cereal with a hint of citrus
P: Oily mouthfeel. Sweet front of palate that climbs into a baking spice 
F: Quick oaky and spearmint finish that continues that spice flavor long after it's gone"

4.0,"Good, but not great.  The $50+ price tag is unwarranted.  Thankfully, I got it during a leap-year sale in PA for $30, which is about right for this."

2.75,Rough ride. Spicy bite and a warm finish. Definitely better on the rocks then straight up.
