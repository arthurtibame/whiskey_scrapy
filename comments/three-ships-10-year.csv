4.0,"There's something really wonderful and welcoming about approaching your nose to a whisky glass and getting a first whiff of subtle peat. You add salted caramel, some lemon extract, and pow, your lips are in heaven. Then comes the shocker: THIS IS SOUTH AFRICAN?!?! Apparently so, and what an improvement from the younger 5-year-old. Start to finish, with its gentle oak and cinnamon aromas, this is fantastic whisky!"
3.0,"I bought a sample of a South African whisky for the first time because it was highly rated by Whisky Magazine and reasonably priced. Glad I did as it was an interesting discovery. 

Nose: Delicate heather at first. After some time in the glass I detected a creamy berry note akin to some long lost soda from my childhood, or perhaps Cherry Coke. Delightful! (2/3). Mouth: Very smooth, with a rich melting honey texture. (2/3). Finish: Short - a little disappointing that the honey doesn't stick around longer (1.5/3). Bonus: 0.5/1 for value. Overall: 6/10. A very nice whisky with broad appeal, good for newbies and connoisseurs alike. Not the most challenging of drams, just a good all round easy drinker. I'd be happy to own a bottle. (Master of Malt sample 2/18/17)"

4.0,"Sweet peat, pipe tobacco and brown sugar on the nose. Smooth and creamy mouthful, and sweet tropical fruit on the palate. A touch of cinnamon spice for a medium-length finish. I'm really impressed with the smoothness and complexity of this whisky."
