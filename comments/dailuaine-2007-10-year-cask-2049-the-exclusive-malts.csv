4.75,"Amazing stuff. 
Nose: banana, apple, vanilla, nutmeg, clove
Palate: this is full, viscous, and really an experience to behold. Hits the tongue with orchard fruit, banana, and finishes off with the perfect amount of peat. 
Finish: long. The peat plays off the banana, apples, and clove.
In the end, this is spectacular stuff. I just had a nice tasting that included some shot caller whiskey...gts, cask strength highland park and others. I came back to this. Great complexity and easy at the same time."
4.0,"Lots of fruit on the nose, very smooth on the tongue, some spice on the finish."
