5.0,"I haven't had the courage to drink this neat, which is my preferred method of enjoying whiskey. I've never bought a bottle, as I've only drank this while out a restaurants. I drink it on the rocks. The nose is heavenly, with maple, caramel, fruit, and a little sweet corn. The palate shows the wood influence with lots of vanilla to tame the heat. Leather and dark fruits are on the follow through. This bourbon is a complex special treat, for me it's not a nightly sipper, but one to be appreciated occasionally."

4.0,"Had a double pour at a local restaurant/ bar with friends over dinner last week. I have wanted to try this but didn't want to drop the coin on a bottle. Prices in the area have soared to over $80-$90. Started neat and added a couple of cubes of ice. Flavor was good, picked up some of the baking spice and vanilla and definitely the heat while drinking neat. It hit home like any good cask strength bourbon will. It left me wanting though.... One of my usual higher proof pours is Knob Creek Single Barrel. To me this was so similar it's not worth the jump of double in cost. I really wanted to like this more than what I did. Though enjoyable, I doubt I buy a bottle unless I find a steal of a deal. Owning both a standard bottle and a hand selected bottle of KC Single Barrel I'll get by with those as the profiles are very similar. In truth, this is maybe 3.75-4 when considering the price."

C07-B-7. Thin nose, smells like clean laundry. Very sweet up front. Strong and sharp wood notes, almost a sour flavor. Not as complex as some other batches, but still delicious. a few drops of water and this seemingly gets oilier, with some additional leather. 6/29/18"

5.0,"""My favorite bourbon out of 50 bourbons and ryes, by far. Specifically, I have the Booker's Bluegrass batch (2016-01)."

4.0,"It feels like slaughtering a sacred cow to say that this is merely good rather than great, but...it's good, not great. The nose is spiced orange creme patissiere smeared over leather; the palate is aggressive, woody, and leathery, with caramel, spices, orange peel, and a cherry-tinged finish. For me, this is the date that's very attractive, but comes on just a little too strong. Water brings out a milder, smoother palate with a little nip of salt amidst the leather, oak, spice, and cherry. Improved, but still not the best bourbon I've ever had, either. Then again, I'm the oddball who prefers Baker's to Booker's, so maybe it's just my palate. Still worth drinking, and quite good...just a bit overpriced and overrated."

I don't think it's the most delicious bourbon out there or anything, but it's an experience. Water opens it up, but there's something that just feels right about sipping it neat and feeling all that spicy warmth flood my mouth and sinuses. I prefer Scotch most of the time, and the thought of paying Scotch prices for bourbon these days is a bit off-putting, but for Booker's I make an exception."

4.0,"Nose: Vanilla essence, baked apples, orange zest, treacle (almost cola-like), floral notes. Some warm cooking spices - cumin, cardamon, turmeric. Berries, fresh leather - like the smell of a leather coat shop. Deep down there is some oak and an aniseed scent.

  Palate: A spicy-sweet arrival with toffee, allspice, ginger, sweet chili and lime essence. Aniseed again (hmmm, how much rye is in this?). 90% chocolate with orange oil, a sweet and spicy baked custard served with strongly brewed English breakfast tea. Licorice, treacle tart, and cinnamon. Very complex.

   Finish: Medium, less length than I'd anticipated, ending with a lightly peppery, spicy-sweet liquorice.

  Very satisfying at all stages. I got little vanilla from this except on the initial sniff, and the more water you add the more it fades. The official tasting notes bore little resemblance to my experience, however as this is a batch thing that's understandable. It also changes character noticeably as it is diluted, from very spicy down to sweet. Finding the right balance for you is the key here, and it's worth it.

  I'd strongly encourage anyone tasting this to add water. Tasting it neat will anaesthetise your taste buds and numb your palate for a good 15 minutes. I preferred it cut down to around 46% at which point it's eminently approachable and the sweet part of the character can be explored.

  The wood influence is very well handled - it's neither spirit nor wood driven, but there is a subtle astringency from the oak tannins that is perfect. I suspect it is one of the factors the warehouse managers look for when selecting the casks for this expression. This is a high-class whiskey, deserving of its reputation, but to tell the truth I almost prefer Baker's Bourbon for its more approachable, unashamed woody character.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

Notes: Booker’s is probably in my top three favorite bourbons. The price tag can sometimes seem a little steep, but in my opinion it is worth it. For me, I describe the flavor as very “masculine,” which I am partial to with my bourbons. Due to the high proof, I recommend enjoying this on the rocks or with a splash of water to open up the palate...but of course you know I’ll be drinking it neat. What can I say?

On the nose is intense, dark brown sugar caramel, cinnamon, vanilla, oak, leather and a hint of smoky barrel char.  Sweet and spicy root beer with a strong alcoholic tingle.
-
To the palate it is incredibly dense and powerfully alcoholic.  Rich, sweet dark caramel and spicy cinnamon makes for a very intense and warming dram.
-
In the finish the warmth and oak reside with tingling spices and vanilla.
—
With water the nose really opens up revealing heightened versions of all the initial aromas with particularly more prominent oak and spice notes, as well as candies orange peel and ginger.
-
Still powerful on the palate, now tingling across my entire tongue, top and bottom, sweeter and spicier with some candied ginger notes appearing, leading to a more dry oak finish.

4.0,"Very good bourbon, but wouldn't it pay $60.00 for it again. At 122 proof it is very strong. To me, it is woody, peppery, spicy, full, and oily. Is it it just my impression that these higher proof whiskies have more oil and smoke? It is noticeable even after watering it down to 90 proof or so."
4.0,Stout and bananas depending on the batch ;)

4.0,"Great high proof bourbon - not as hot as Stagg Jr. but every bit as complex. Drank half of the pour neat before discovering it was bottled ~61% abv and didn’t even notice.

The nose is oak-y, with spice and vanilla coming forward first followed by a cherry aroma.

The palate picks up a bit of spice, a lot of the oak and leather described and trails off into a rich tobacco finish that probably changes 2-3 more times before fading out.

I’m intrigued by this one! Try it without water first but I do recommend a splash to spread the flavors/aromas out."

3.5,"There is a ton of vanilla on the nose, very noticeable even though you can't stay in the glass too long. There's also a caramel sweetness that reminded me of taffy and a bit of oak underneath. It should be no surprise, but this whiskey kicks. On the first taste I got nothing but salted peanuts in the shell. I got a hint of cherry lurking on the edges before the heat rolled in. Second taste wasn't nearly as overwhelming and had more oak and vanilla with a creamy-char sweetness that I couldn't put my finger on but tasted like something nostalgic. A couple drops of water cools the dram down and brings out the barrel notes while tamping the sweetness down. The cherry becomes more muddled with other dark fruits and the salted peanuts return on the finish and linger for awhile."
4.5,"Ok, this bourbon was a present - it’s a little outside my normal price range. Having said that, I may need to rethink that rule for some special occasions. 

Love the full flavor and nice spice. I don’t taste as much vanilla as Expert but it’s there nonetheless. 

Great flavors- caramel, oak. Great finish - lingers nicely on pallet. 

I’ll repeat for right occasion."
4.0,"Tasting the 2018-02 “Backyard BBQ” bottling.

Nose is very soft with loads of vanilla, caramel with some underlying cherry notes.

Silky smooth mouthfeel, and a bit spicier on the finish but nothing close to what you’d expect from a 128.8 proof spirit.

A touch of smokiness and woody character along with leather rounds out the sweetness of the vanilla and caramel."

Long finish took along time to dissipate(good).

Was very well balanced it transitioned very nicely from note to note.
