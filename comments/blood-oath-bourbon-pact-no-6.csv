4.75,Spice and vanilla to start. Then an orange flavor with a continued nice burn. Super long finish. They really knocked it out of the park on this one!
4.5,"Neck pour. Rested for 15 in a glencairn.

All leather and oak up front but after a few minutes and swirls, vanilla, apple, orange, and lemon become more prominent. Some dill and pepper peek in too. Its blended well after it all comes together. 

In the mouth its somewhat a surprise. Oily, tangy, and a little salty. All of this make for an unexpected sensation that took a few sips to get used to. But once I did, I fell in love. Biscuit dough, peanut brittle, vanilla, cinnamon, and apple dance on the tongue. 

Finish isn't too lengthy, but its flashy as it fades. Warming, but without burn.

Unexpected in a good way. The blend itself is well integrated and you can taste all the different bourbons present. Cognac finish seems a bit lost to me. 

Biggest issues with this for me are the oily texture and lack of weight on the palate. And the cognac not having much influence.


UPDATE:

A few hours (and a few pours) later and the Cognac sweetness has come much further into play. Mouthfeel has changed, it feels more soft and mouth coating and even the finish is longer and more cohesive as well. Upping my score to 4.75. Wish they would let you rate every .10 so I could give this somewhere in between a 4.5 and a 4.75. Oh well. Great blended bourbon and the packaging is great too. Nice heavy wooden box for display."

3.0,"Aroma is light and spice-driven with some herbal and rye bread-like notes showing as it opens, which works well with the sweetness – it’s my favorite part of this whiskey; Palate is good but feels like a muted version of the aroma and doesn’t come through as richly; Finish ends up turning to an almost cloying sweetness. Not bad, but I like Pact 5 more."

4.0,"N: Sweet buttered corn and caramel
P: Semi-viscous mouth. Big punch of butter and sweet brown sugar, meanders between a bitter wine and sweetness mid-palate
F: Short pop of brown sugar and it's gone"

4.25,"These Blood Oath releases have been wildly erratic from a quality perspective in my opinion. Pact 1 was decent but failed to live up to it's price tag. Pact 2 was a marked improvement whilst Pact 3 (best to date) was outstanding. Pact 4 was a step back and Pact 5 was entirely forgettable. 

Pact 6 had me instantly intrigued when I first read the components. 14yr old, 8yr old and a 7 yr old finished in XO casks. All are high rye Kentucky bourbons (source undisclosed). They are then blended together and brought to proof 98.6 (same as the temperature of human blood a play off the name). Spice from the rye and the sweetness of the Cognac seem like a winner, so let's see how it panned out..

 Entry is silky with vanilla, caramel, orange peel, clove and oak. Mid palate is where the Cognac influence appears with juicy grapes, French oak (like a well aged Cognac) and dark chocolate. Finish is a medium length with more oak, pepper and butterscotch. That French oak note returns and lingers 

All in all it's a lovely, well executed Whiskey. I'll knock 3/4 of a point for the finish and the high price point. Definitely worthy of a bottle purchase! Cheers!"

2.75,"Nose - At first I really can't get past the dusty oaky and nutty notes. Instantly has me thinking Jim Beam though Heaven Hill isn't impossible either. However if you dig down you get into a really rich leathery sweetness. There's some classic bourbon but it's being shifted and sweetened by the XO casks. They really do come off rather nicely here.

Taste - Up front it's smooth and light, almost instantly the XO sweetness picks as it moves back. I've let this open a bit and the oak and dusty/nutty notes that make me think Beam are already fading, still there and there's still peanuts and corn nuts. But the real showcase is the bourbon vanilla notes and the xo sweetness. The finish I feel is fairly decent despite some other reviews. The dry nutty oak comes and goes a few times while the sweetness admittedly drops off but finds a way to come back as well. 

A surprisingly rich mouth feel on what is a somewhat thin bourbon...I know that sounds odd but it's one of those bourbons where you can tell you're drinking a thin bourbon BUT it's oily and viscous which gives it a really creamy mouth feel too. 

There's a part of me that was hoping for a bit more given the use of 14 year old bourbon and my just general love of XO finished bourbon. There was also a part of me praying it wasn't another batch 5, it's not. Anyway I'm going with a firm 2.75 with this one. Very nicely done, clearly a step above average bourbon, but I'm reaching for any deeper notes or complexity that isn't more or less beam with xo casks at an OK but not great proof. 

108 bucks and for that, it's not a must buy but if you're into these kinds of finished bourbons I don't think it'll upset you either. It's funny how I'm becoming more and more forgiving of over priced bourbon while getting ever more frustrated with younger scotch prices."
3.75,"On the nose almonds, rye, sweet corn, chocolate and black pepper wake you up.  Upon tasting, it has a bit of a dusty start.  Raisins, fruity wine, slight peanuts and potpourri round out a nice floral-y palate before going down.  After swallowing, toasty oak notes, sweet nuttiness (walnuts), leather and tobacco surface.  The finish hangs around with an oily mouthfeel while not stinging your tongue.  This is an enjoyable discussion bourbon for sure."
3.25,"Nose: medium cherry, with some apricot, or pear. Taste: a lightly charred oak and smoked cherrys on the finish... The finish is short and sweet; fades away quicker than you'd prefer."

5.0,Great color out of the bottle. Definitely get the sweet toasted note on the nose. Immediately get that perfect Rye flavor in the mouth with leather and tobacco notes. Medium finish with a good KY hug.
3.0,I was disappointed in this and clearly am an exception to other reviews.    Neck pour smelled and tasted of varnish.    There is so much better available at better prices.
