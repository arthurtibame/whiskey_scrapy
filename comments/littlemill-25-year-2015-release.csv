4.0,"So, this bottle sells for $4,000. No, that wasn't a typo. I've tried hard not to let that fact color my opinion of the whisky, which is pretty damn good on its own merits. The nose is fruity and nutty, with a bit of vanilla; the palate is a beautifully integrated fruit salad of tree fruit, melon, and stone fruit notes topped with sweet vanilla cream, milk chocolate, and rum raisin ice cream. I feel privileged to have had the chance to try it at a local tasting; it's a very good dram. Pity I'll probably never get to have it again!"
