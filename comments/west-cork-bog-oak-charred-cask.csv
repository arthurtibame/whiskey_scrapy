4.25,"A nice light fruity nose. On the tongue, gorgeous chocolate. Not a hint of chocolate, BOOM CHOCOLATE! A lovely finish as the chocolate fades into lovely nuance in a medium length finish. Definitely an Irish whiskey, but the bog oak definitely added something unique."
3.25,"Very very smooth, lovely nose of charcoal and heavy alcohol whiskey however it's so smooth it's almost slightly bland. Perfect for strong flavoured food or for a nice relaxing sip at the weekend. Good starter whiskey for those not used to any 'kicks'"

4.0,"The nose is strong and earth but not intense with lemon, honeysuckle and a hint of oak and black pepper. The palate is very subtle and earthy with lemon, butterscotch, brown butter and touches of oak and vanilla. The finish is medium with a fading smokiness with lemon and oak and a rich creaminess."
