3.5,"Japanese whisky tasting evening, Sydney 28 March 18, Whisky #6.
    
    Nose: Berry scented bubblegum or gummy sweets (or jelly babies). A soft licorice aroma that morphs into a charred smoky note.

    Palate: Lovely soft and richly elegant arrival, red fruits, orchard fruits, sweet mulled red wine, berries, hazelnuts and almonds, a slight coconut note. Milk chocolate and some well-handled and subtle oak tannins.

    Finish: Medium/long. Sweet grains and berries. A touch of mild anise, nutmeg and allspice.
    
    The nose on this is instantly attention grabbing – but in a good way? I’m not sure. It is intensely berry-driven to the point of almost being a parody of a wine-finish nose. It’s so overwhelming I nearly laughed out loud at the first sniff.

    The palate was, for me, better than the nose. It’s more subtle and the sweet fruity flavours are balanced by nutty cocoa. It’s so like a confectionery it almost veers towards tasting like a bar of fruit and nut milk chocolate, but the slight oaky presence saves it from going too far and introduces a touch of spice just in time. Water just softens it but brings out nothing new. Take it neat.
    
    An interesting vatted whisky rather than a really good one. In comparison to the grain and blended whiskies we had tasted previously in the evening it was clearly a superior dram, but then they brought out the Yamazaki 12 and it was immediately eclipsed. I’d still recommend this as an experiment – it’s certainly worth a taste -  but I wouldn’t buy a bottle as it is quite expensive.  It costs the same as Yamazaki 12, but it is nowhere near as good.

    A hard one to rate. It’s right on the border between “good” and “very good”.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

5.0,Σχετικά γλυκό για τα γούστα μου αλλά με ατελείωτη επίγευση.
4.0,This is definitely an interesting profile. Almost like burnt rose water (maybe because I tried this after a Caol Ila Sassicaia wood dram). It's a bit like what I'd imagine a rose wine mixed with a pot still spirit to be. Initially I thought I wouldn't buy a bottle but by the end I think I just might. It was my favorite on the night due to it's point of difference. The aftertaste is slightly ethanolly but still good. Interestingly it includes malt distilled at the now-closed Hanyu distillery. Looking fwd to trying more of Chichibus offerings.

5.0,"Nose is extremely rosey. Something else as well, which I can't quite place, lightly covers the rose

Very light syrup mouthfeel, more akin to an americano rather than espresso

Sugary at first, salty notes underneath. Buttery overall. Rose clotted cream might be a good description.

Super smooth, no alcohol burn whatsoever."

5.0,"Very good stuff with notes of berries, cherries, raspberries, wood, spices, chocolate, and a little toffee. Favorite of the Ichiro's Malt Pure Malt leaf series."
