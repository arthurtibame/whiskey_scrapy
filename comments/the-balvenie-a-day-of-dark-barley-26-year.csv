3.75,"A very different flavor profile for a Balvenie, leaning towards cocoa powder and coffee grounds rather than its trademark honey. Finishes strong and long with more cocoa powder and black Russian bread. These are all tastes I gravitate towards - porters and stouts are my favorite beers - and Balvenie is to be commended for experimenting with barley variations. But I found the nose disappointingly shy."

The best of the night and that lineup included heavy hitters such as a 1980s balvenie 10 year old founder’s reserve in a cognac bottle, a 1980s Balvenie Classic oldest selection 18 year which is predecessor to the doublewood we know today, this, and a 1971 33 year old vintage cask"
