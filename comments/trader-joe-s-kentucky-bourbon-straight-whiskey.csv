3.5,"Tasing neat.  Nose is dominated with alcohol, with some oak and a little caramel.  Tasting starts with light sweetness, oak bitterness and hot-ish cinnamon that's pretty consistent through the finish.  The middle adds soft, oaky, dessert spice and a little red apple that gives way to some saccharine sweetness that results with a red hot candy finale.  A little water didn't seem to tame the heat/harshness, but took out the complexity and brought out more saccharine in the finish.

Not a bad bourbon by any means, especially for the $$, but I wouldn't call it smooth or complex. It's definitely in the Barton family as it does share some general characteristics of 1792 with the heat, oak, and cinnamon.  It improved for me with some air time and hand heat, as it brought out the more round and delicate flavors that you'll find in Old Barton.  Think of it as a love child between 1792 and Old Barton, but a little younger (though I wouldn't say it tastes young) and with different barrel selection.  I'll probably pick up another bottle when I'm close to empty and am shopping at a TJ where they sell spirits"
2.5,"Lacks complexity and has a rather weak finish. But if you’re looking for a $15 whiskey, you could do MUCH worse."

2.25,"A very generic bourbon that is overpowered even at only 90 proof. Offers some vanilla notes and adequate spice, but overall mediocre whiskey even for the price."

3.5,"Definitely young so there’s some heat as well as the higher proof. Overall very pleasant bourbon from Buffalo Trace. Could do way worse for the price, I picked up some red apples, vanilla, oak and cinnamon on the palate, after allowing to breathe the nose smells of creme brulee or a rich bread pudding."

3.0,Drinkable on its own but not what I would call a sipper. Great for mixing and cocktails as it will stand up to about any type of mixer. My go to for my bourbon barbecue sauce. A good value.

4.0,"Nose: very harsh alcohol hits the nose
Palate: Green apple and honey, tastes as if it has no alcohol what so ever
Finish: lingering honey and a bit of a drying sensation from the alcohol.

Worth the 15 dollars for a cheap drink"

3.0,A little too sweet to drink straight or on the rocks. But for the price it is a great bourbon to keep around for Old Fashioneds... And keeps from using nicer bourbon for mixing

4.0,"Great $15 bourbon, can not beat the price. Buffalo Trace Mash aged in 1792 barrels. Way underrated...also make a great old fashioned"
3.25,"Not bad. A little warm, but good basic bourbon flavor. At $15.99 a bottle, I would buy this again"
