4.0,"I definitely need to begin with a little rant here because I don't understand how there could really be anything less than 4 stars for this diamond in the rough. I mean we have to start by understanding that it's like a $35 bottle at most. Friends, it is definitely worth the price, it is most definitely unique in that you get that speyside burn with a a chardonnay barrel twist and its a single malt 10 year! Sure just because it says ""10"" year and its under $35 doesn't mean it will absolutely taste good. (Lismore would be an example that comes to mind) but honestly, you will not regret this purchase if you're into speyside style whiskey. Its vanilla in the front, builds on intensity and ends with a pretty spicy dry finish. Bottom line is that it's highly recommended for anyone on a budget that is looking for a single malt, with a great profile. (do not add water to this one)"

2.0,"Glen Moray ""select tasting"" #1. Has same bite at Chardonnay. Definitely not one to add to the collection. Water made the bite even a little stronger. Vanilla comes in on the finish."
2.0,"You can taste the Chardonnay. Spice and sweetness. 

With water, has more bite. Vanilla comes out in the finish. 

Tasted at Glen Moray Distillery on 7/22/2016"
4.0,"I liked this more than I figured. Spice and vanilla, very creamy texture, rich but not to the level of, say, Macallan. Nicely balanced and, for pete's sake, it retails for like $25. Good value!"
4.0,Very tasty scotch.  Great product especially for the price.  Smooth and great tasting.

4.0,"Light bouquet of vanilla, honey and floral notes on the nose. The body, however, is fairly robust and features a balanced combination of shortbread, nutmeg, and faint notes of licorice on the palate. The finish is sweet and of medium-length. Tasty stuff and an absolute bargain if you can get your hands on a bottle ($40 USD)"
4.0,"Wow this is great stuff! You knock two years and you add chardonnay casks, and the final product is so much better than the 12-year-old expression. This was a treat: some lemon, honey and flowers to the nose, with a palate that has the faintest hint of smoke and honey. And the finish it's remarkably complex and long for such a young whisky. If you're reading this review while staring at the bottle on the shelf of your local liquor store: buy it! You'll thank me later."

1.0,"First, let me say I have been a fan of Glen Moray Elgin Classic for some time now. However, I am NOT a fan of this chardonnay finish. The chardonnay is not subtle, and, for me, simply wrecks the wonderful malt notes I look for in my Scotch. This does not work for me.  (However, I do enjoy the port cask, that one does work for me.)"

null,"This is a fine dram. Underrated. Though not a huge fan of the age statement (12,16) Morays, this is a lively dram, with hints of champagne bubbles, honey, and a pleasant mouthfeel. Hidden little gem especially at the price point."
