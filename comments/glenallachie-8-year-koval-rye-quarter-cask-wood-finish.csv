3.5,Quick hit review #1: I caught up with a friend at my favourite bar when I flew down for work. I tried 5 whiskies before I jumped on the plane. I was keen to see what Billy Walker could do with a new distillery. Was it his magic or Glendronach's or both that made his releases a winning combination in his time there. Based on this and the portwood I tried it seems like it was a combination effort as out of the 5 drams his efforts were 4th and 5th. Thinner and rougher but more interesting than the portwood which was the worst of the night.
