2.0,"It's taken a while to figure out how to rate this one.  I was intrigued by the notion of an unaged rye so I picked up a bottle for 25$.  

The nose is very vegetal, hay, straw, a bit like a barn yard.  That carries into the taste with a short finish of some heat and alcohol.

IMO is not a pleasant sipper, it's different and thats intentional.  Trying it may improve your understanding of other rye and aging processes.  I've been looking for some cocktail ideas to try with this.  If you have any post them.  If not it may be used for some home blending/aging.  While I'm interested in trying other Coppersea offerings I won't buy this one again."
