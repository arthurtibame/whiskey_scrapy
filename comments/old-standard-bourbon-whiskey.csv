3.0,"This organic bourbon (didn’t know that was a thing!) has very thin oily legs seen in the glass and has a nice amber color.

The nose is pleasant but not extraordinary with notes of dry straw, green strawberry, honey, lemon, vanilla, and a floral quality.

The palate has notes reminiscent of a dessert with burnt caramel, oatmeal, and chocolate, as well as fennel and some barrel spice.

The finish is long and hot initially with a tangy spice in the same camp as chicken from a Chinese restaurant. Cheers!"
