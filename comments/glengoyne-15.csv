3.5,"A highland that surely feels like a speysider. Very fruity, very straightforward. It is a normal dram. 

Bottled at 40% abv, pale straw color (actually a rare thing for a 15 yo).

On the nose is better than in the palate. Orange jam, orange hard candy, brown sugar. Not much else but fine aroma in those three notes.

On the palate is mostly peppery, with some honey and red apple notes. 

Finish is medium, with an oaky burn. 

Overall i give this dram a 71 over 100."

4.0,"Okay time for a proper review!  On the nose I get sweet fruit cakes and jelly, with a very rich perfumed waft.  Drinking it I immediately recognize salted caramel, and a handful of plums and raisins that you just sink your teeth into before sucking them dry.  I also get the feeling like I ate some cocoa powder with it.  Very sweet, but not confectionary sweet.  Sort of overripe I would say.  The finish is dry and lingers for a decent amount of time.  At the end I get black pepper.  I’m still torn because this isn’t a knock your socks off whiskey, nor is a slouch in the least.  It’s, dare I say, smooth.  It’s light and accessible to newcomers yet for the seasoned pro (which I hope to one day be), you could find its place among others of its kind.  Also, the $60 price tag for a 15 year old will keep me running to this before any of the big brands, and you’re not losing out on so much.  I would like to try the others in this line, but for now this is good!

Edit [06/2017] - After having the bottle open for some time with the contents being depleted to about half, the overall spice and ripeness has given way to a strong salted dark chocolate caramel covered cherry flavor profile.  Still quite enjoyable, so the score remains the same."

4.0,"A solid 4.    Admittedly this is the oldest expression of Glengoyn I've had so far, but it's outstanding.  The bourbon and sherry casking work very well together.  You get the fruitiness and vanilla from the ex bourbon but the sherry finish is very  present on the nose as well.  The arrival is quite intense and full flavored due to the fresh American oak.  Sherry is the first thing I pick up in the development...A bit of sulphur but It's actually quite nice.  I get something reminiscent of orange pekoe tea as well.    Fairly sweet on the tongue...Very nice mouthfeel, however the finish is a bit short.   A bit of time and a drop of water opens it up even more.   Overall thoroughly enjoyable."

null,"GLENGOYNE 15  43% ABV    6/24/17

Uncolored and Aged in Sherry casks from Jerez, Spain and Bourbon Barrels from the USA.

COLOR: a Dark Gold with a Reddish tint, Many Legs running quickly.

NOSE: A rich stewed fruit note arises as the bottle is opened and the Spirit poured, Floral notes in the background. As the whisky sits in the glass a malty sweetness arises.

PALATE: Ripe Fruit notes with floral notes in the background. Pepper rises as I swirl the whisky around. Silky mouthfeel which grows richer as it warms.

FINISH: Sweet going down with a dry sweetness and a mouth watering sense, a dry sweetness lingers.

Added 1 Drop of water

NOSE: Subdued Maltiness. There is an unidentified pleasant meaty? note.

PALATE: Subdued Malty Sweetness, the silky mouthfeel remains with a rising pepper on the tongue. A pleasant malty sweetness around the edges of my tongue.

FINISH: Drying with pepper rising. Pepper diminishes as drying increases.

I Love the stewed fruit note when I opened the bottle and the rich fruit notes in the nose and palate with floral notes surrounding it. The Silky mouthfeel is very pleasant. Unfortunately, the Rich Fruit and Floral notes fade after sitting in the glass. There is a nice Malty sweetness that lingers but I miss the rich stewed fruit and floral notes as I enjoy the glass over an extended time. That being said, I am looking forward to how air will interact with the spirit in the bottle; My experience with GLENGOYNE 12 was very good."

4.0,"Thanks to Davie Warner for the sample!  This is a classic scotch.  It has all the hallmarks of what you think of when you think ""single malt"".   Cereal and shortbread, smooth and silky.  No burn or heat, about as velvety as they come.  I honestly couldn't taste any Sherry influence at first, but if you let it breathe, then you can just taste a tinge of hazelnut.  Really well made.  Thanks again Davie!"

4.0,"Thanks again to Davie Warner for this sample.  Glengoyne 15 is hard to describe for me in some ways because it strikes right at the core of what I consider to be ""scotch.""  It's a combination of malt, cereal grain, furniture polish, honey, and a bit of woodiness.  It's a very pure, smooth expression of that flavor, and I think it's proofed just right, clear without feeling thin, but without the tongue burn or anesthetizing effect of higher proofs where this kind of quiet flavor profile would be nuked into oblivion.  Pleasant finish, on the dry side, with some vetiver or lemongrass.  To fall back on a wine analogy, this is a have-with-fish kind of scotch, and would be a recommendation for anyone who wants to get a sense of the ""heart"" notes in a scotch.  I was surprised to see online that this scotch is aged in a mix of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks.  I frankly have a hard time detecting much (if any) sherry influence here, except perhaps in the lightest of touches of nuttiness and spiciness in the palate and finish -- which could just as easily be the power of suggestion."
4.0,"Vanilla, honey and malted cereal on the nose. Creamy caramel with hints of almonds and citrus on the palate. The finish is lightly spiced and relatively short. Not extraordinary in terms of complexity, but very tasty and easy drink."
4.0,"Bonus points: noticed it clearly states 'Natural Color' on the label! After a respectful amount of time to open in the glass, sweet vanilla and earthy wild honey rise to the occasion, followed closely by beloved petrichor and lemon zest. Once on the palate it's all sweet malt chocolate and powerful oak spices. The finish is long, mild bittering menthol, with baked lemon zest lingering longest. A balanced, easy drinking, old-world implicative sort of  dram. Dry glass: banana pudding."

4.0,Bought a small bottle in Edinburgh. Drank same night as Balvenie Doublewood 12y. Liked the Glengoyne more! Very smooth and without a lot of smoky finish. I'd buy this in US is available.
4.0,"Located upon the Highland Line, there have been endless whisky debates as to whether Glengoyne is technically a Lowland distillery. Be that as it may, their 15-year-old Single Malt has definitely earned your attention. The nose is complex and intense with fresh fruits, grainy toffee and confectionery. Honey, sour apples and lemons intermingle with kiwi, sucrose and hints of white wine. Flavorwise, cinnamon, floral vanilla and walnuts add up to a rich and quite aromatic mouthfeel, followed by an earthy, slightly dry and oak-dominated finish. A lovely dram!

4.5,"Barreled in first fill bourbon and finished in sherry casks. https://youtu.be/WaDcOhX4Tzs. https://youtu.be/jdAjPbgmtXk. Smells, and tastes a bit, like bailed hay (shortbread also makes sense), and it is quite smooth. A rich flavour and the aroma is fruity, with vanilla shortbread and some brown sugar."
4.0,"Little spicy, some hints of vanilla and nutmeg, touch of almonds, nugat and salted caramel"
3.5,"Nose: Woody and fruity notes, faint lemon oil, restrained sherry. Malted milk chocolate balls and a touch of mint.

Palate: Rich malty flavours, vanilla, toffee, nuts, caramel, dried fruits, cocoa and some warm gingery spice notes. The mouthfeel is excellent, very rich, sweet, soft and just a little oily. The texture is delightful and one of the best parts of the experience.

Finish: Medium/long and smooth with chocolate toffee and some sweet spiced citrus.

A soft and pleasant whisky with the single fault that after being open for several months oxidization had caused the toffee notes to dominate the palate. This was a pity as it obscured the rest of the profile and made it a little cloying.

Still, it's a very well made and reasonably priced 15 year old highlander that just barely falls short of 4 stars for me.  (I'm a bit puzzled by the official score of 95. This ranks it as equal to Bruichladdich Black Art 4, Laphroaig 25 and Hakushu 25, and seems extremely generous).

“Good” : 3.5 stars"

5.0,"I haven't been into scotch for a great deal of time but being a long time fragrance and coffee enthusiast I do know a thing or two about quality. This one is my favourite drop so far, first smell and taste was such a treat as is every glass from then on. Very rich but extremely smooth, I wouldn't say a finishing bite necessarily but definitely a lot of solid presence there. For me it's a solid, genuine and beautiful to drink whisky. It's going to take something special for this to be beaten in my book."
3.0,"95? I suppose, if you're looking for something to put you to bed. I'm going to have to agree with Jim Murray: this one is a lullaby. There's malted barley, vanilla, and cinnamon. But just as important, I now have something other than chamomile to help me phase into the night."

4.0,"Nose: bourbon-forward. I pick up vanilla, cinnamon and baking spice, along with red apple and a citrus note to compliment.

Palate: creamy and full mouthfeel. Powdered sugar, oak and lemon meringue coat the mid-palate with a pinch of alcohol/pepper in the background. 

Finish: short-medium and dry, with an almost sour nuttiness which lingers for a bit. The oak and citrus really assert themselves here, eventually giving way to a shadow of dark coffee and cordial chocolate.

A decent pour at a good price at around $55, but for me the sourness on the finish just doesn’t play incredibly well with my palate. 

Update: a few months of oxygen has done this single malt well. The finish has rounded into a fine creaminess that I’m growing more fond of by the day. Bumping up this score from 3 to 3.75

3.25,"After hearing really good things about the Glengoyne distillery I noticed a 3 malt, age statement sample pack at one of the online stores I regularly make purchases from.  This pack was only $17 and included 2oz pours of the 10, 15 and 18 year old.  I figured now was as good of a time as any to give them a go.

I reviewed the 10 year a few weeks ago, so let’s move on to the 15 year old.  This one was bottled at 43% and proudly proclaims to have no added color, but I’m sure it was chill filtered.  Speaking of color, this was honey gold and will reward you with medium-sized droplets and thick, runny legs after a good spin in your favorite tasting glass.

The nose came charging forward with a rush of honey nut cereal notes, butterscotch and a very subdued oak presence.  I gave it a little more time and some vanilla beans and a more pronounced oak flavor worked itself forward.  It was a nice balance of sweetness and wood character.

The palate was somewhat underwhelming, from a flavor standpoint.  The oak notes dominated this aspect and were overly harsher than I’d expected.  There was a buttery note that calmed things on the back end, but there wasn’t any complexity to be found.  I think the flavor profile was better with the 10 year old here, sadly.

The finish was short-to-medium in length and rather oily.  Again, unremarkable for a respectable 15 year age statement.

Overall, this is a decent malt that you could add an ice cube to and make it a walk around cocktail, but there isn’t enough action to sit around and analyze this thing from a neat drinker’s viewpoint.  I’m trying to look at it like this rather than just pronounce it boring and average because it’s still a quality and reasonably priced single malt.  If you’re looking for excitement, however, I’d look elsewhere.  Hopefully the 18 will deliver on the complexity.  It’s still a solid 3 star whisky.  Cheers, my friends."
3.5,The best choice between the youngest malts and the older. It has a nice combination of dried fruits and wine notes. Love it.

2.0,"So, I think I'll be doing a bottle kill week soon, though with dieting it might be more a month (trying to cut back on drinks during the week).  Anyway this one is on that list with about 3-4 pours left (conservative pours).  So lets get into this one, clearly I must like it if it's near death.  

Color - I tend to avoid this but as it's a a brand know for sherry...its' pretty golden.  Now that said this one is a mix of sherry and bourbon with a bit more focus on the bourbon barrels from the label.  So at least for me this was my second buy from Glengoyne and so far my two buys weren't sherry bombs (I have had the 25 which is and is amazing).  So just a warning for those who might be expect their stuff to be all sherry, it isn't.  

Nose - vanilla and oak for sure.  Pineapple and white sugars.  A good swirl gives me a bit of berry.  I get a bit of alcohol which I didn't expect at 43%.  

Taste - vanilla, tropical fruits, oak, some spice, some candy, more vanilla, baked goods.  

I really do think this is a quality whisky and it drinks much more full bodied than the 43% would indicate which is a huge win for me.  I however really just can't justify another bottle for me which makes that this is in the kill zone a bit sad.  This is quality whisky but at the same time a bit boring.  I went into this one looking for sherry and I didn't get it.  I came back looking for a great bourbon finish and I got the vanillas but I didn't get the complexity I want there either.  

This is a classic example of a 2 star whisky for me.  Everything is good about it, but nothing is special.  It's in some ways a good price for the age and the use of some sherry casks but it's kinda also over priced.  I'll have to go back to them but I felt the 12 was more what I wanted from the brand.  Anyway if this is your profile I think this is a reasonable buy if you want to venture into something new, but otherwise I'd not look for this one."

4.0,"Vanilla, rich, butterscotch or toffee. No smoke, not sweet. Full flavor and allspice on the back of my tounge. Butter and oak on the exhale. It's actually very unlike most I've had, in a good way. OP12 and Bruichladdich Barley mixed together but without the sea...not a bad combo."

3.5,"A lovely sherry finish for a balanced whisky.
For the end of the night to chill."
3.5,"Sad about the rumor that this may be discontinued. 
One month open, half-full bottle pour (I'm optimistic). 
Sweet almond overall
nose  = trail-mix with Cheerios - not ""honey nut"" 
taste = same as the nose with a hint of tropical fruit and banana (dried with the trail-mix). Very viscous 
Finish = short bread cookie and honey, and almond. 

Value: Priced perfectly, score is reflective of the experience (no adjustments for price). This is a viscous almost almond-y experience throughout. This would be great either with, or for, a light dessert. I would also show this bottle as a great example on non-peated, non-sherry bomb, but still brings a unique experience to the table."
