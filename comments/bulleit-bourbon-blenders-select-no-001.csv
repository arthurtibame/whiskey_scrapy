3.5,"I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Bulleit. Regular Bulleit Bourbon and the 10yr Bourbon I am not a fan of. The regular Rye does the job as a decent mixing Rye. The Bulleit Barrel Proof is a very underated offering and pretty damn tasty. So when I was strolling thru my local Total Wine (back when we could do that sort of thing) this one piqued my interest! After reading thru the the components that made up this ""Very Limited"" release (which can be easily found at any liquor store in the metro Phoenix area) it sounded a whole lot like the Four Roses Small Batch Select.  3 out of 10 recipes. Different Yeast strains. Featuring 2 high rye mashbills. Focusing on fruits and soft Bourbon note... Does that sound familiar?? Layer on top of that it's a well known ""secret"" that Bulleit sources from 4 Roses... Notably this one is older at 9 yrs old (6-7 for Small Batch Select).. Let's dive in... 

Upon entry it's soft but very rich.... Vanilla ice cream, buttered toast and honey... Mid palate adds cinnamon and apples with a toasted oak driven finish... A dash of white pepper that lingers...

This stuff is definitely tasty and a big departure from the Bulleit profile... A lovely creamy mouthfeel is very welcome... $50 I feel is a bit high for what you get (4 Roses Small Batch for $20 less isn't much worse) but it's still solid.

Cheers All!"

4.0,"The nose has some what perfume-Ish vibes to it ,while bringing out fruits such as cherry and other fruits but having them be dried.
The palate is fruit forward yet again with touches of oak . Very rich and full bodied 
The finish has nice hints of pepper that last throughout while also almost a creaminess to it
Overall I’d give this a 88-100 and defintely will be looking for more! A must have in my collection for the price!"

3.5,"Scent is very high on rye and oak, both young and aged, and smells like the proof is even higher than 100, which is always a nice bonus. As with most Bulleit products, the body is notoriously light, so the flavors don't come to the forefront immediately. I've had both the 10 year bourbon and the cask strength bourbon, and this product does a great job of blending those two concepts together, while adding a good amount of fresh rye to the mix. This has a much better taste of cask age compared to the 10 year bourbon, which is very bland and unimpressive. Meanwhile, the proof of this is almost perfect (could be a tad bit higher, I bet), and brings along the other flavors much easier than the regular cask strength bourbon, which didn't have a lot going on other than oak-based flavors from the cask.

All in all, this is a good pick, for the price found, but only because it's a limited release. If I knew this was going to be around, I would probably steer elsewhere to save a bit of money."
2.5,A little underwhelming. Strong alcohol burn but light on the nose and flavor.

4.0,"Has the Bulleit house feel and rye/spice forward palate, but more flavorful and a coating mouthfeel. Nice neat, and even better on the rocks to tame the 50% abv. More fruity than the current Bulleit Frontier whiskey, IMHO. Glad this is a spring whiskey, it’s one of the bright spots while sheltering in place. 

$40-45 for a fifth is not terrible, but Four Roses Single Barrel is a worthy competitor at that price."
3.75,"They say that Four Roses is the distiller behind Bulliet, and I can definitely see the Four Roses DNA here, but if you think this is simply one of the FR products under a different label, it does exhibit some distinctions. Read on...

On the nose getting cream soda, apple, barrel spices, mixed cocktail of citrus zest, and a hint of cedar. 

Palate opens with vanilla custard and ripe plum, leading to cinnamon and charcoal in the mid-palate. Flavors have a decent amount of richness. Not the most complex, but what's here is nice. 

Finishes with spicy peppercorn, oak, and cherry cough drop. Finish is enjoyably long for the proof. 

Mouthfeel is soft and delicate even when the palate isn't. 

Overall I enjoyed it and found this to be tasty, but at $50 there are better options available. Misses the 4.0 re-buy rating on price; would have made it if it was $35."

4.0,"Aroma: honey, cherry, oak, cinnamon
Flavor: baking spice up front, turns to a mild cinnamon and a little cherry and a small amount of peanut on the finish. The finish is rather lengthy with some spice hanging around for a while.
Overall: packs a big punch for 100 proof and had a good amount going on. I like this with a bit better than the four roses small batch select"
