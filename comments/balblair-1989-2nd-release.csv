5.0,"Absolutely glorious nose -- vanilla, apricot, soft lemon...very pretty stuff. Apricots and soft fruits reappear on the palate, with something else rich and extremely satisfying, something like buttered French bread with marmalade. Light to medium body, long silky finish. Very impressive."
4.0,Nose is soft hints of fruit. Taste is sweet with dry fruit. Smooth finish

5.0,Beautiful fresh apples on the nose which follows through the palate. Just too good. If there was something to call the nectar of gods this comes close. Just too good.
4.0,"Mine is actually the 3rd release of this vintage, and exactly what you would expect from a whiskey of this age. Soft tannins, with a smooth and lingering finish. Apricot and warm vanilla."

5.0,"This is a masterful expression of what malt whisky can be. The nose is a cornucopia of fruit and grain notes - ripe grapes, peaches, apple. There's vanilla, honey, cream, a pinch of spice, and maybe the lightest hint of pipe smoke, too. The palate is as luscious, generously coating the mouth as all of these elements dance together, first the fruit and then the rest gliding on and on into a long, smooth finish with dark chocolate staying on the palate for a good while later. Truly a classic."
