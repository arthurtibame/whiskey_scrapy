null,"Very. Strong. Drink . Difficult to drink easily .
Burns long after it's been imbibed . Not easy to forget . Not easy to take another drink .
I enjoy it on a sophomoric level. This would be a wonderful tipple for a cold wintery night as you huddle In your rags down under the barren and harsh shelter of the coastal dock yards ."
5.0,"Dayum.  This is a tasty drink.  I was very excited to have tracked down this release (living in PA makes special finds more than difficult).  When I got this home, I couldn't wait.  I poured me a glass and savored the sight, aroma and wonderful taste of this bourbon.

This Parker's Heritage is a beautiful golden color and looks beautiful in a cut crystal glass.  The nose is sweet with apples and berries.  I pick up the wood and a hint of spice (with a splash of water I also get cinnamon).

On the pallete I really get the cinnamon-apple flavor and a really dark berry, almost cherry note.  There is some caramel in there, but not as much vanilla as I would expect with a 10 year old bourbon.  The spiciness of the rye from the mash bill is there, but not overpowering - you know this is bourbon, not rye whiskey.

The finish is smooth with just a bit of heat.  The flavors linger on the tongue.

This is one of the best I have had.  I think I will need to tell my friends it is terrible and encourage them to try something else so I can hold on to this one for a bit longer."

5.0,"I love the cinnamon that comes with the first sip. It then opens up with a depth of cloves, nutmeg, and vanilla, followed by a medium-heat finish that's a little surprising coming for a 96-proof whiskey. Very different than the 6th edition. A great bottle for the collection."

3.0,"It could have been my high expectations. Maybe it's because the bottle was 2/3 gone and oxidization had taken its toll. Or maybe it's because it came after the sublime WLW, but this was aggressively mediocre and certainly not worth the money, considering I could have bought two more WLW for the price."

5.0,"Parker Beam said it all (and I can only paraphrase), 'This is what I think bourbon should be.'  I believe Parker knows what he's talking about!
    
    I had this in a blind tasting where it was the unanimous winner for the night.  Full bodied with rich flavors of leather and vanilla, and an oily texture that allows them to really linger.  Only a moderate burn going down, but it hangs there for a wonderfully long time.  I loved this tasting and feel fortunate to have an unopened bottle in my cabinet."

5.0,"I gave three stars because it hurt too much to give it two. I wanted to love this bottle. My first real limited release find. Found this lonely bottle on the shelf almost two years after it was released at retail price. I bought it and couldn't bring myself to open it. Finally I gave in, poured a glass, and it was awful. Maybe I'm missing something or my bottle was bad, but wild turkey 101 has a leg up on my bottle. Not sweet, no depth, and an almost sour finish. It tasted young...or like it had spoiled. I didn't think whikey went bad. Maybe my  palate is broken. So disappointing.

Update 11/22/17 - after a year or so of oxidization, the bottle has blossomed into a beautiful whiskey - a trend I’ve noticed with other PHC offerings. Gone is the oaky bitterness, and now just an incredible balance of sweetness and spice remains. As close to a perfect bourbon as I’ve tasted. Maybe my favorite of all time. I wish I hadn’t had to wait until half of the bottle was gone to taste the perfection. The hype and marks on this bottle is justified"

4.0,"Nose stings a bit; there's deep caramel, and furniture polish. Some floral honey as well. On the tongue, thick mouth feel, very smooth initially and then the spice slowly cascades. Sweet wood notes. Very drinkable and feels substantial, but isn't quite as memorable as some of the others in the Heritage collection. 7/14/17
One year later, different bar/bottle, exact same flavor profile, I wouldn't change anything about my previous note. Good stuff. 7/24/18"

5.0,"Pro-tip -- if you're in New Orleans, Avenue Pub has about a third of a bottle of this, and a pour is $17.25.  Promise of Hope is probably the best non-barrel proof bourbon I've ever enjoyed, with a virtuoso level of harmony and balance among its boatload of classic bourbon scents and flavors:  caramel, butterscotch, toffee, smoky oak, orchard fruit, leather, vanilla, cream, maple syrup, and rye spice.  It really is everything to love about bourbon, revealing itself gradually in stages, and with a thick, luxurious texture.  The finish is an overnight house guest in terms of how long it stays, with some interesting notes of licorice, anise, spice, and eucalyptus.  This bottle is close to impossible to find now, and egregiously expensive at $500 or more, but it is near the pinnacle of the whiskey world.  I wasn't experiencing any unique or surprising flavors for much of the experience, however, which is the sole flaw that keeps it from ascending to A+ territory."

5.0,"Nose: nuts, licorice, maybe some fudge, and whipped cream complex though initially simple

Mouthfeel: buttery and soft

Taste: opens with butterscotch and vanilla, transitions to cinnamon and baking spices while a subtle heat enters, leaves chocolate and raspberry on the tongue

Finish: medium length with a whisp of heat that lingers very pleasantly 

Definitively the best pour I have ever experienced, and even got to kill the bottle for a little extra"

Indescribable odor on nose & taste on palate.
Uncertain what it is or how to describe it ...probably not 100% accurate but almost epoxy or plastic or... like?? Or something that does not belong here???
A little hot for 96 proof
Long finish
Good other than that off profile...Anyone else???"
5.0,"I had the pleasure of sampling and killing this incredible Bourbon at my local Whiskey Bar! This was the 7th Parker's Heritage Release and boy did Heaven Hill make sure to select the best of the best! Is it really possible that a 10yr old Bourbon bottled at a relatively mild 96 proof be that good? Let's dive in...

Upon entry is oily and mouthcoating with a wonderful mix of sweet and spice. Maple syrup, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon all in perfect harmony. Caramel apples and a hint of nuts on the mid palate lead to a decent oak and spice driven finish. It lingers..

To put it simply, this is a quintessential Bourbon! Cheers All!"
