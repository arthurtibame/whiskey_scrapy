4.0,The heat is enjoyably there but it is far from overpowering. A well-balanced and smooth dram.

3.75,"Nose: Intense caramel apple and brown sugar with some oak as well as a bit of dill / rye spice in the back. Powdered sugar. 

Taste: Gingerbead cookie with some pepper and dill. Lingering bitter finish. Light cherry. Dark brown sugar and molasses. Slightly biscuity malty flavor. Bright almost minty flavor."

4.25,Corn and wheat on the nose. The rye spice really comes though in the end. Really smooth and easy sipping.
3.0,"Nose- Smells young, caramel with a bit of apple.
Body- young with a grajny bite. Cinnamon, Black pepper, and brown sugar. The rye comes through here. Has a thick mouthfeel. 
Finish- caramel and brown sugar. 

Note-.This is my favorite of the Journeyman series."
3.0,"Caramel on the nose. Still getting some leathery, rubbery taste"

4.0,Very distinct notes of caramel. This flavor seems to overwhelm the others. Overall a nice whiskey with a smooth finish

4.0,"Good whiskey, but a little too spicy and salty without some smoothness or sweetness to even it out. Definitely get the dark fruit and spice. Tasted the cask strength version. 

***EDIT: tasted the regular version, and I liked it much more than the cask strength version."

4.0,I really enjoyed this. I was surprised how well rounded it was for such a young whiskey. You can certainly taste the immaturity but it's not unpleasant at all. A little pricey for being so young but delicious.
3.0,Pleasantly surprised by this. Slightly fruity with notes of chocolate and coffee. The finish was pretty bitter though.

2.0,Way too oaky for me to enjoy.

2.0,Might be a bad batch or bottle but mine tastes like chewing on a pencil. Woody sharp sour notes and not much else. Pass
1.0,"3-19-17 I really didn't like this at all. The nose to me was a strange chemical smell, like turpentine.  The taste for me was not of chemicals, but not impressive either.  The taste didn't get better with water but the nose did lose the chemical smell.  The mouth feel was smooth but lacked the depth of flavor that I desire.  So for me this $50 750ml is not worth it as of this date 3-19-17. I will try it again after the bottle has time to open up as that may and i hope makes a difference.  I  don't know how this has the rating of 91 on this site not for me I'm rating it at like 80, but I will retry and update the review.
  
  3-21-17 Tasted again, & YES THIS IS TERRIBLE!!! I'm now given a 1star instead of 2 because I have to factor in the price.  Do not add water because it only get worse it just smokes out.

UPDATE 
5-27-2017

STILL HATE IT!!! 
 
This will be for the person that never buys a round, but always wants a drink!!!

4.0,"Really a 4.5 here, with that extra half point for originality. This is a smooth, suave mammajamma; the nose has caramel corn and vanilla, with a little hint of rubber sole and shoe leather. The palate is a sweet, smooth tour of all four grains in the mashbill - bourbon caramel and vanilla, rye spiciness, a rich, leathery quality from the barley, and a smooth, supple sheared finish. Very nicely done...and from Three Oaks! We cut our Christmas tree down there every year! Looks like I need to get more than a Douglas fir there next week..."

1.75,"Young sour leather note with a bit of linseed and pencil shavings, oak and slightly sweet."
1.0,"Has plenty of that ""young craft whisky"" note.  Has some sweetness and grains behind it."
4.25,"Sweet, rich, oily. Reminds a bit of stranahans, which is odd as that is technically a single malt, where as this is a fourgrain. Overall, its excellent. Smooth and complex and completely unexpected."
4.75,Very great whiskey for the price point. Has a lot of complexity for being a young craft whiskey. I bought 2 bottles!  Great whiskey and easily drinkable neat!
3.25,Tasty

4.25,"Very complex flavor; bold smell to match. The flavors are very complementary in both their pairing and timing. I’ll need more to dissect what all I’m tasting, but I know I like it."
4.0,Really complex and interesting but drinkable
3.75,"Nose is dominated by ripe fruits and barrel char.  Rich cigars and wood.  Black pepper notes as well.
Warm and sweet front, some cloying... Smoky."
