5.0,"Wow, this is a great American single malt.  This is very smooth, with subtle oak notes woven through the larger malt, vanilla and honey flavors.  I really thought I was drinking an Irish whiskey until my brother-in-law showed me the bottle.  Great stuff and very drinkable neat.  I just wish it wasn't $50 a bottle for the 375ml.  Considering it's only 2 years old, it has an amazing flavor profile but at this price point I can't justify this over Stranahan's or many other single malts out there.  5 stars for the flavor."

4.25,"I stumbled upon this particular bottle in the clearance section at my TW. It typically goes for $49.99 for 375ml and was marked down to $19.99. I also had a $5 reward making this just $14.99. Double checking there wasn't any allocated Bourbon or Rye they had got in, I figured why the heck not. 
I have enjoyed most of the American Single Malts I have tasted abd figured there wasn't much to loose for $15! 
In doing some research on this it became pretty evident why this was tagged as ""rare"". The Distillery only ever released 12 total barrels between 2012 and 2017 in these extremely small batches. They were predominantly only available at the Distillery with very limited distribution outside of Oregon. 
They are now up to 200 mature barrels and have since launched the Westland Single Malt (Black label and the other one you see on this site). That bottling contains Distillate up to 5 yrs old. 
For my specific bottle, it's age stated at 2 yrs old. Batch 11 and bottle # 500. It's bottled at 90 proof, is non chill filtered and aged exclusively in #1 char new full sized American Oak barrels. They source local barley and ferment for 6 days (double the time most Whiskey ferements) utilizing ale yeasts. They then double pot distill it. So long story short they aren't taking any shortcuts and the resulting Whiskey is the better for it! On to the tasting:
It enters with a soft, velvety feel with apples, honey and a slight cinnamon note. Mid pallette brings orange peel and some cocoa notes before the lingering finish brings back baking spices and some young oak notes. 
It's all in great balance and is an extremely enjoyable pour. Really impressive for such young stock especially when you consider there is no finishing whatsoever. It's not worth $50 for a half bottle, but to be honest I would not have been dissapionted even if I paid that. For $15 it might go down as one of the best buys I have made in recent memory. 
I strongly recommend really to any Whiskey drinker. It's really unique, not like a Scotch, Bourbon or Rye. Closest to Irish but not as sweet. Just a lovely dram. Cheers all!"
