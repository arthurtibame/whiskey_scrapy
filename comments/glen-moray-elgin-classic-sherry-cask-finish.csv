4.25,"Super light flavor, distinctive scotch taste but very sweet. Tail grows sweeter as it goes along, and has a woody sweet taste, I bet what Sherry tastes like. Doesn't taste fake or added at all, wonderful blend of flavors. Thin and light, needs no water. Minimal bite. Just short of 5 only because it's actually a little too sweet for me. Tastes like dessert."

3.0,The sherry influence is present all the way and prevails any other flavors of this dram. It's weak and vanishes quickly afterwards. It's not bad for the price but still can't recommend it.

3.5,"Medium sherry note with strong hint of ex bourbon cask spiciness on the palate and that carries on with your normal sherry note floating in the background. I find the wood bitterness seems to be carrying on for a bit in your month, taste most likely be charred American oak. I would actually recommend port version then this one."

3.25,Large Sherry notes with spices and a bit of citrus brought out with water. Sweetness is there but tempered by the Sherry notes. Easy to sit down and sip on with a bit of chocolate.
3.25,"Nose grape, honey, nutmeg. Pallet grape, blueberry, vanilla"

4.0,"Very sweet, no burn and simple. Almost a wine type finish."
1.25,"Horribly harsh. Smells like ethyl acetate. Like a headsy rum from a first time distillery who is huffing paint. Acetone. Pungent. Burning the nose. This shouldn’t be a finished product. It hurts the throat as much as the nose. An assault on the senses. This is terrible. I don’t do mixers like cola and such, but I can’t imagine any other way to suffer through a bottle of this."

2.5,"Nose: Slightly sour apple cider, stewed pears, white grape juice, malt extract, a little dry oakiness and a waft of vanilla.

Palate: The entry is semi-sweet and mainly cereal in profile with grassy-herbal and biscuit tones. As it develops, a grapey sweetness unfolds with a little hint of astringency. It's tannic but more like the tannin of red grape skins than oak. The texture is OK, almost creamy but somewhat over-watered.

Finish: Medium. Sweet cereal and grape flavours fading to a slightly drying winey aftertaste.

This is another expression from the range of ""finished"" lower-tier Glen Moray whiskies.

Glen Moray produces a spirit that is matured in refill bourbon casks and bottled as ""Elgin Classic"" at around 6-8 years of age. It is a light fruity dram with overtones of buttery cereal and it is a fine example of an entry-level Speysider at a very reasonable price.  I often buy it to use as a mixer instead of a blended scotch.

The distillery then adds a range of finishes to ""Elgin Classic"" using a variety of different casks - port, wine, sherry, etc. I've tasted all of these now and mostly I've found the finishes to be an intrusion on the simplicity and freshness of the basic bourbon-cask matured whisky.  It has a crisp personality with hints of mint and lemon citrus that always seem to be lost under the dull cloak of the finishing.

Anyway, out of all the lower-tier finished expressions this is my favourite. It's a simple single malt that is good value for money and typically priced to place it in competition with lower-middle shelf blended scotches, and it is a fine alternative to such blends. Also, like all Glen Moray expressions, it gains body and sweetness as it oxidises in the bottle. There is an elusive note to both the nose and palate that took me ages to pin down - it's ginger, but not the usual ""spicy"" hot ginger you encounter in single malts. This is like very dilute ginger syrup or cordial, mild and almost fruity. 

By the way, don't confuse the entry-level GM range with their more up-market, finished age-statement whiskies which are of a considerably higher standard. Similarly, don't write Glen Moray off as a lightweight - there are some much older OB expressions and independent bottlings that are very good.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"

3.5,"The nose is very approachable. Fruity, a little spice and oak, and some honey. The palate is also relaxed. Apricot or pear with some cereal sweetness. A hint of chocolate can be found and some baking spices or light cinnamon. The finish goes away fairly quickly, but it is easy and does not leave with any bitter notes. A great value dram and one that can be easily enjoyed with friends."
3.0,Ice ball from the fridge. Not overly complex.
