3.0,"Seriously think back to the episode of Dr. Who with the last remaining human who is constantly asking for water.  This is that in whiskey form.  Before adding a drop of water it is single note and harsh.  After adding water, it does not become complex by any means, but it does help the harshness quite a bit and bring out a lot more of your barrel spices and flavors."

3.5,"Appearance: I really liked looking into my glass and seeing this wheat whiskey. Its football leather dark brown color was impressive, while its thin viscous legs clung to the inside.

Nose: The nose was complex and hard to pin down, much like the exact location of Carmen Sandiego. But as is common and nice in wheats, it was overall welcoming and flowery. Notes of candy sweetness, cherry Twizzler, maple syrup, candy corn, kiwi fruit, and some stranger notes of soggy campfire, pine sap, and steamed cauliflower made themselves known.

Taste: On the palate was a noticeably oily mouthfeel. Notes emerged such as sour tree sap, tart Granny Smith apple, barrel char and tannins, and buttered bread. It was nice but not overwhelming.

Finish: There was a nice and mellow yet lingering cinnamon finish.

Thoughts: I appreciate the fact that wheat whiskey is a growing category. This offering I’d say is a worthy addition to the lineup. Yes, it has its typical wheat soft floralness, but it also has a ruggedness to it as well. If you have the opportunity, I’d definitely recommend giving it a try! Catskill Distilling, thank you much! Cheers!"
