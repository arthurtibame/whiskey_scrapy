3.75,"This is solid juice for being younger and from a new distillery. There’s enough flavor to really enjoy neat, safe to assume would make awesome cocktails. There’s a softness that’s present with your classic bourbon flavors topped off with enough spice to keep you coming back. Plenty of finish too. For the price, this is a no brainer. Definitely want to try some of their single barrels I’ve seen recently this is batched with two different mash bills."
