2.0,Do you want smoke? This has smoke. Do you want peat? This has peat? A brash commercial entry into a sublime genre.

4.0,"Finishes a bit spicier than Ardbeg, but has similar notes... A nice blend (and value) for those who like intense smoke and peat."

4.0,Smokey peat with a very dry finish.
4.0,"Great Islay taste with a friendly price tag. 
Smell:  Bar-b-que, pork, sweet, smoke/peat!
Palate:  citrus, lemon/lime, orange, salt, brown sugar, 
Finish:  medium-long, smoke!, smooth, hint of melon?
Check it out!"

2.0,"A heavy Smokey peat aroma, like a campfire. The texture is not too oily. Overwhelmingly peaty with a cereal grain taste slight oak and vanilla. The finish is long and will stay with you for a while"

3.75,Pop variety of island whiskey. As it should be
2.5,Straight up smokey and a little hot. I’m not getting much of the fruit notes that others have described. Not bad for a cheap pour.

5.0,"Smokey, bonfires, salty, phenolic, like pinetarsal, but in a good way. Reminds me of South Coast Islay. Some sweetness, like lightly caramelised sugar. I am enjoying this. Ticks the boxes for me. Would definitely buy again."
