3.5,"20 Barrel Project 2019
58% Corn, 34% Rye, 8% Barley

Tasted Barrels No. 7 (Bubbles, KCMO) and 20 (Gomer’s, KCMO).

Relatively deep copper orange color, but lighter in the glass with a generally thin body and narrow legs.  Traditional rye nose with hay, menthol, muted cinnamon, cream, and chili peppers.  Clean and pure - can snuff deeply with no flash of burn.

Nicely spiced on the palate.  Again chili peppers and cream are assertive, but allspice, anise, and especially clove make a bold appearance.  A splash of vanilla.  Only modest sweetness at any point through the tasting experience.  Cracked black pepper, menthol, and a gentle barrel char note wash the palate and linger quite prominently on the finish.  Cloves outlast the others.

Overall it is quite spicy; somewhat more than many of the mainstream barely legal rye whiskies.  A surprisingly well-made dram for small-market Iowa.  Not a knockout winner, but one heck of a value at $30 for a 46% single barrel craft bourbon with zero ethanol on the nose (scored the Bubbles one for $20 on clearance - one of 4 remaining bottles)."
