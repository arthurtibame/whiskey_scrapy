4.0,"Blended malts can be very enjoyable when done well. Master blenders deserve praise when they consistently produce a quality scotch. Green Label fits the bill. Sweet and sour on the nose, like green apple dipped in honey. And then seasoned with a tiny pinch of salt. On the palate, light smoke and peat come forward together with a touch of pepper. The finish is the least exciting part of this dram. Some sharpness and no more layers. Good scotch nevertheless."

4.25,"Color: Deep Copper (1.0), long slow legs on the twirl - oily

Nose: Floral and bright with hints of honeycake, banana bread, lychee, chestnuts, and salt.

Palate: Tropical fruit with a side of peat, a pepper bite along with black tea and salty brine. An overall light mouthfeel with a touch of bitterness from the peat.

Finish: Mellow peat, and an earthy flavor lingers. A hint of dry oaky spice as the finish slowly fades away.

Overall: This was my first adventure into the world of Johnnie Walker. After a bit of research it seemed this was the best “bang for your buck” JW - and I see why, theres a lot to like here. 

The dry salty/sweet profile, while not overly complex, is kind to the palate. The delicious nose and dry oaky finish are perfect bookends to an enjoyable dram.

My only complaint is that the flavors present aren’t as complex as in some non-blended whiskies. There’s a lot at the table here, but the flavors aren’t necessarily woven together - they’re just “there.” The whisky isn’t a journey, it merely has stops along the way.

Still, I enjoy what’s in the glass, and for $50 you can do a lot worse. I don’t think I’ll ever buy a more expensive Johnnie Walker, but that’s fine because I’m perfectly content with this.

3.0,"Transferred from Barreled App:


Here's to the final Johnnie Walker core range, blended whisky that I need to try to complete the catalog.  The Green Label is a blend of 15 year old malts and comes in at 86 proof.  Thanks again to Paul for this generous sample (I've sworn off of JW blends at this point as I think they are almost all subpar and too similar to warrant chasing them all).

The nose here is heavily chocolate influenced with a bit of peppery oak cask.  There's some faint smoke to help round things out, as well.  The palate is thin and after an initial mocha creaminess is overpowered with oak spice.  Too much spice.  It sort of wrecks the finish by carrying over into it, while washing away pretty quickly.  I guess that should be considered a good thing, but for some reason it isn't.  I hate sounding like I'm flip-flopping with my expectations but this feels like what's happening.  It doesn't seem like a typical JW, and that is a small plus to me.

While I don't think I'd want an entire bottle of this, it is better than most other JW blends I've had.  If I had to rank my top 3 it would be:  JW Double Black, Rye Cask Select, and this Green Label.  There, I'm done with you Johnnie.  Moving on....

PS- A big thanks to @Generously_Paul for the ability to review and add this to my whisky total.  Cheers."

Taste - Sweet spicy oak, lightly smoky pear cider w/ hints of salt, black pepper, hint of dried apricot, baking spices, light leather.

Finish - Lingering black pepper & sea salt, light fruity smoke, light ashy fruit, hint of lightly off putting metallic.

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This is a nice non-offensive very lightly peated blended malt. Nothing overly complex about it but it's great to sip on and I could see this being used to mix some cocktails as well as it has a nice salty lightly smoky quality that would go quite well in cocktails. Not to mention the price is quite good for a 15 year blended malt. Probably best neat, but I could see this doing pretty well in a highball with a squeeze of lemon or in a whisky ginger.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Only if there wasn't anything else I wanted to try on the menu

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"

Typical coloring for JW, perhaps a shade lighter than JWB12. 43% which is up from their usual 40%, and only single malts used in this blend. This is the 2015 rerelease for the States. I did not try the original release so I cannot compare it to that. Crisp red apples on the nose, hard to get past that but also some floral notes. Very light peat on the palate/finish compared to JWB12. Slightly peppery, probably using Talisker. A good scotch. Better than JWB12, but not by much.  3.75"

Problem is that it tries too hard to be everything that it doesn't stand out on its own. I'd prefer the smokey goodness of Lagavulin or the mellow sweetness of a solid bourbon alone over the combination here.

But that's not an indictment of this bottle's overall goodness. I don't hate this and will see that this bottle has a prominent place on my whiskey shelf, but it definitely is not an all-star."

This means that it also contains cheap grain whisky. Green Label is 100% Malted Barley. It is a blend of Single Malts with no grain whisky aged at least 15 years.

Color: Amber

Nose: Granny smith apples, a touch of ash, clove, honey, honey dew melon. Lovely.

Pallet: Barrel char, honey, gala apple, oak spice, thin but rich (flavors are bold, but it does not feel thick)

Finish: Long smoke filled finish, charred oak, and a honey sweetness

Not complex, but still has a great flavor profile."

4.75,"This whisky is excellent. Unlike the cheaper Johnnie Walkers (red and black), this whisky is very smooth and complex. This is the only Blended Malt in the Johnnie Walker line. Because this is a blend of 4 single malts, it packs a punch of flavor. On the nose, you can tell that the base is something fruity (Cragganmore & Linkwood). You are hit with oranges and peaches as well as some honey. If you look for it, you get some of the sea spray character from Talisker as well as a hint of smoke from Caol Ila. On the palate, it’s very beautiful with fruit and floral notes. To draw a picture, imagine eating fruit and flowers from a garden on a shore of a Scottish Isle near a bonfire pit that had a fire in it the night prior. The fruit and flowers are the main event, but you are near the sea and and some fresh ashes which subliminally influences the experience of the fruit and flowers. It’s very smooth and just plain delicious."

Probably even worth the price which was comparable to a single malt of similar quality. Nose: mostly Maltiness with a bit of fruit, old leather, and just a hint of smoke. Palate: nicely balanced, still no real peat or smoke flavors but the rest of the scotch flavor spectrum is well represented. I never say this in reviews, but this one has good mouth-feel. Obviously a blended malt with no grain whiskey. The finish is where you finally notice the islands character. Much longer finish than you’d expect based on the softness of the nose and initial smoothness. If I could find it cheaper (or get a hefty raise), this could be a daily drinker."

And yes it was served to me in a plastic shot glass! I'll try to not let it impact my opinion of this dram! Let's see how it tastes! 
Upon entry honey, nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon kick things off with subtle peat. As it moves to the mid pallette, the peat picks up and adds some oak spice. Finish adds a lovely rich toffee note to go with the smoke and oak spice. Man this one hits all the right notes and is beautifully constructed. 
It kinda reminds of a less refined and less complex Blue Label. It's got that DNA for sure, it's just the brash younger brother. 
Man that spice lingers on the tongue for a good while. I think I'll get another pour to confirm my findings! 😂
Cheers All!"

The pallete: more black tea, lemon peel, peat smoke

The finish: medium finish, medicinal peat, slight sweetness,medium body.

By far the best release of Johnny Walker. Not overly challenging, but interesting. I don't find black tea notes in many scotches but this one hits it home."

3.75,"I bought this bottle back in January. My initial review on Barreled was from my first glass out of the bottle and was somewhat less than generous. I should have known then and certainly know now never to review a whisky on the first glass. This review is a composite of my notes from getting to know this bottle over the last six months. 

JW Green is a blend of four single malts: Talker, Linkwood, Cragganmore, and Caol Ila. It’s bottled at 43% ABV and is a bright gold in the glass. It carries a 15 year age statement. 

Initially the nose was underwhelming: malted barley, honey, and barely there smoke. Over time however this has changed considerably. The smoke became more prominent as well as the appearance of a darker malty note and black tea. Really quite nice. 

In the mouth there is a rich, oily/buttery mouthfeel that gives up notes of sweet, malty honey along with a moderate amount of smoke.

The finish is where this whisky really shines in my opinion. Rich, meaty smoke, peppery leather and tobacco hang on for a considerable time. This is one of the few whiskies that I’ve found really benefits from a bit of water. A quarter of a teaspoon to approximately two ounces in a Glencairn does amazing things to this dram. Most of these notes/impressions are from this formulation. 

Overall this is an excellent blend, perhaps the more so because it is a blended malt as opposed to a blended whisky, there being no grain whisky in this blend. At $65 this is a decent value as well, just don’t judge it based on the first glass out of the bottle. Slainte!"

4.0,"NOSE: Starts with a bowl of hot oatmeal, changing to a handful of dirt and black tea leaves. That evaporates to expose orange peel, sea spray, and charcoal smoke.

PALATE: Starts with a sweet cream, developing into some nutmeg and ginger after 5 seconds, and finishes quite strong with peach, dark chocolate, and cinnamon bark.

OVERALL: You can’t do this without expertise and blending! People rave about Hibiki blends, but if you want that complexity with the punch of Scotch it’s right here at 1/10th the price!"

4.5,"Artificial gold color and clearness of the chill filtration can both be found in this dram. Nose is delicate, not very strong like you would expect from a 15-year-old whisky, with notes of black pepper, vanilla, a bit of oak, and smoke on the back. Palate is smooth, with sweet and sour notes in perfect harmony, taste of raising, figs, caramel, butter scotch, oak, vanilla, honey, sherry are all intertwined with a bit of smoke. This is for sure not dominated by Talisker and Caol Ila but you definitely feel their presence and they do add a nice layer of complexity. Sweetness of the speyside malts is the base of this complex dram. Finish is smooth and sweet, with raisins, apricots, and caramel, and a hint of lingering smoke on the back. A few drops of water in this 43% ABV dram opens more fruit and sherry character, although in my opinion this whisky is already very well balanced. Overall, it’s a very nice and complex dram that nevertheless has a distinct Johnnie’s character. It’s a blended malt that is not overpowered by its more smoky components and strikes a perfect balance between sweetness and complexity. I wish they would have left artificial coloring and chill filtration aside in this one, it definitely deserves to be honestly presented."

Taste - Just neat seems to have a cool smokiness that has oak but slowly dried fruit that has that nutty taste.

Finish - the nutty just lingers and slowly becomes sweet in like peanut butter.

The smoky and peaty notes you get in here are from most likely from Caol ila 12, it taste very similar. The sweetness are most likely from Cragganmore...etc

With a sniff on the nose, it's is so complex but at the same time it's so balance. There is not a single note that dominate the others.

Even after a sip, you can feel all sugary flowing on top through you and all the bitterness, spices and smoky bits at the bottom all at the same time.

This is indeed a wonderful blended whisky from Johnnie Walker."

3.0,"Now we’re getting somewhere...

This one is a blended malt, as opposed to JW Red & Black, which are just blended whiskies, so the grain component is absent from this malt, as is that offensive metallic note found on the noses of those two. Instead the nose is all maltiness with a smokey lemon note (maybe the Caol Ila?). 

On the palate, it still tastes like Johnnie, but fuller, rounder, more coating and complex. Quite a step up from JW Black. The proof lingers on the mid-palate (all 40% of it...), and the finish is considerably longer than its predecessors. Yeah!

For those of you playing the home game, I’m reviewing my way through the Johnnie Walker core range as well as a few of its component malts. This one was solid, and was reminiscent of some non-sherried Highland or Speyside single malts. Is it worth $60 SRP? For me, no, because if I’m going to pay that much for a blend, it’s going to be something from Compass Box, but this malt is still a quality drop, and shows that House Walker doesn’t just produce bottom shelf swag.

The taste while viscous is watery the first couple o seconds then a slight serried malt and milk chocolate, then medium peat and smoke finishes off the palette. This whisky however developed in the bottle , bringing; orange, melon, plum, slight banana, fresh cut grass, hay, slight caramel/mint and milk chocolate. The peat and smoke comes more to the front as the bottle goes but most of all the salt, sometimes overwhelming so. The finish is medium to long on a all around great whisky.

I keep both in my bar and you should too; however, if you want the better bang for the buck, get the Johnnie."

The nose has the best of Speyside with light sweet fruits and maybe a hint of smoke. The palate celebrates a deep malt, with spice and now a little island peat or earthiness. The finish can be a little bitter but brings out char, oak, and smoke. This is one of the best releases from Johnnie Walker and I think everyone should try it at least once on their journey."

4.5,"Green Label is a blended malt from four different distilleries (Cragganmore, Linkwood, Caol Ila, & Talisker). Aged 15 years, this blend marries some of the best parts of Speyside, Islay, and Skye.

The nose is heavy and complex with toffee, dried fruit, leather, and a slight amount of peat and iodine in the background.

Smoke competes with fresh apples, raisins, nuts, and chocolate to be the dominating flavor on the palate with the smoke ultimately winning.

The smoke fades into an oily malt finish with a little pepper on the tongue.

Johnnie Walker hit a home run with this blended malt, and I think it stands out against their other offerings. If you want to buy a bottle of scotch for someone and don't know what they like Green Label may be the perfect option as it has something to offer for everyone."

4.5,"This is a super-smooth dram with moderate smoke finish. It has legs and a great mouth feel. The four malts used in this vatted blend are wonderful in their own right. However, in this case the sum is not greater than the parts, While smooth, I found nothing memorable about it, the finish was primarily smoke to my taste buds, and brief. There are several malts or blends that I would prefer at half the price. The fault may be in my particular bottle.  Have bought more bottles of JW Green to see if my opinion would change somewhat---and it has. I still find it very smooth and flavorful, but the finish is longer and the smoke is less dominate in the finish, allowing savoring honey/malt notes more satisfactorily. This reminds me of a less fruity and more smoky Dalwhinnie 15, which I think to be a wonderful dram. I am giving a rating of 4.5. I still think JW Black is a better value for your $$$$"
4.5,"Great whisky. A little warm. Nicely smokey, sort of like an islands. Beautiful."
4.25,"I had reviewed this some time back before it was briefly discontinued.  It was a great pour then; maybe the best of the standard lineup.  A pure malt which makes this somewhat unique in the JW lineup of blends.   Has time changed my taste?  Is this as good as I last tasted?

The nose takes some time
to open, and when it does, a gives forth a variety of aromas. A subtle sweet peat nose with an earthiness: hay, earthen minerals. Maritime brine, iodine, leather, lemon oil, barley sugar, apricots, honey, and caramel.  Quite pleasant. 

A medium bodied spirit that arrives with a Talisker pepper spice.  It begins to develop into a sweeter dram with honey, vanilla.  The spiciness pushes forward again but with ground cinnamon, nutmeg and gingerbread. As it fades, wood notes make a their presence. 

A strong finale which lingers forever.  Wood spice, orange cream, vanilla and dark chocolate and charcoal. 

This (still) holds it’s own is just flat out good.  Complex yet approachable.  Sweet yet spicy.  Most whiskies have the great nose, but through the progression, diminishes through the course and finish flat.  This stays consistent and one could arguably claim the finish is the best part of the experience.  I will always have a place on my shelf for Johnnie Walker as this was the brand (Black Label) that was the only whisky I drank (in my youth).  Green however, is just on a level above many.  What makes even better is you can find this under $55.  On sales here locally, I grabbed it at $45.  Seek it,  sip it and enjoy it.  [Re-tasted: 12/20:19][92/100][$45]"
4.0,"Talisker, Linkwood, Cragganmore and Caol Ila all 15 years minimum in a blend??? Whisky Tango Foxtrot, sign me up! Good on Diageo for putting this out there. A blend of single malts/vatted malt. It’s really good. I like it better than Johnny Walker Blue. It’s very mellow and not too peaty but has a little touch of smoke. Super easy to drink and not expensive. Sometimes you just want an easy, non-challenging whisky that tastes good and goes down without a fight. This is perfect for those times - Kudos to the master blender. The Distiller score is pretty legit. This goes into regular rotation!"

4.0,"Tasted neat in a glencairn. About 10 minutes allowed to elapse after the pour. 

Beautiful color compliments a viscous fluidity that exhibits solid sheeting and thick, slow legs. 

The nose is sweet honeysuckle on a spring evening. In the background is a whiff of brine and a peat fire on the beach. Florals dominate a complex bouquet that ticks a bunch of boxes for me. 

The taste is a tale of two profiles. On the one side I get honey, orchard fruits and vegetation. Reminds me of a lovely sweet Speyside. On the other I get malt, brine and high tide near the beach with a dash of black pepper. The two work well, but aren't melded. The sweetnees goes just a little too far for me.

This scotch whiskey misses greatness. But it's still very good. Clean, smooth, rich, complex, easy to drink, lightly smoky and definitely sophisticated. 

I'm not a single malt snob by any means. I enjoy all manner of tipples so long as they represent a best effort by the maker. In the JW universe Blue still outclasses Green - until the price is figured in. Then Green becomes a contender. This is good stuff."

On the nose you will find herbal notes like wet grass, eucaliptus, acetone, mint and ¿coca cola after it loses the gas? (Beats me). Grassy and herbal notes are very powerful, making ""the green label"" very accurate in that way.

On the palate is HOT. VERY HOT. There is a small caramel note, but hotness, oakiness, wood, spices are present. Also i got tobacco and the skin of a peach notes, very exotic flavor, but VERY HOT OVERALL.

4.75,Perfectly balanced.  Little smoke at the finsh but starts off malty and apple sweet.  The smoke stays for a bit after finsh but relieves duties to a green apple.

4.0,"Nose: 4* Big on malt, spices, vanilla cake, fresh aromatic flowers, salty air

Palate: 4* Spicy, full, sweet fruits, salt

Finish: 4* Lichee, Talisker-smoke, saltiness

Very appoachable malt with plenty to explore. A bit toned down. Great daily dram."

4.5,This has always been my favorite scotch. Always good after a night out on the town or just a relaxing night at home. Was das when they stopped making it for a few year and excited when they brought it back.
4.5,You’re a fool if you don’t have a bottle of this in your cabinet.

4.5,"For being peated, I don't get the peat you'd usually find in the JW Black. But that's not a bad thing. The smoke is still there but not as pronounced. It adds a body that gives the dram an expensive taste. It's complex and thus, requires the patience to really enjoy it. It's first light with vanilla, fruit, and apple. But the smoke and warm body come up behind for the finish. It's really good. Like REALLY good."

4.0,"Moving up the Walker ladder to the Green. Love there is no grain and 86pf. Poured neat, nose is refined malt with apple skins, wispy smoke and dusty birchwood. Maybe a little white grape and melon. Velvety mouthfeel brings palate of ripe golden delicious apples, clover honey, smooth malt and gentle smoke with some grassy peat. The barrel notes are joined by sea salt brine to balance the sweetness. Its designed to flow together and it does very well. Extremely tasty with full flavor. The finish is malt and salt with smoke supported by fading fruit and drying barrel oak. There is some spice that accumulates as you go through the pour but again it just blends into the overall package. Single malts can be spikey in their flavor delivery but this is built to be an easy enjoyable ride with the rich notes blurring together to form a cohesive impression. It works wonderfully in this fashion and most will love this scotch......91/100..... I do love it but have to say the bold diversity of SM when you get a truly great one is more rewarding. JW Green has plenty of stuff to pick out and ponder but is better suited to just drink it and flat out enjoy. Great bottle for a gift with wide appeal and tremendous drinkability"

4.25,"JWGreen 15YR/Poured Neat into Glencairn

*NOSE: Pear. Apple. Vanilla. Oatmeal with fresh Red Berries and Honey. Hint of Smoke/Peat. Light Floral. Tea.
*NEAT: Enters surprisingly Tropical & Sweet. Crushed Pineapple and Mango. Beeswax. Vanilla. Oak. Leather. Light Peat/Smoke show up mid-palate through the finish with Sweet Tropical Fruit coating and layering on the palate along with some White Pepper, a wisp of Brine, and a hint of Ash. This is all delivered with a great Velvety mouthfeel.
*SPLASH: A couple drops of water add Iodine to the Nose. On the Palate, the Peat/Smoke notes become a little more prominent. A little Mint is added to the Fruit notes and the coating gets a little more Tingle.

*VERDICT: For a blend that includes both Caol Isla and Talisker, I expected a little more Peat influence and was very surprised by the sweet tropical nature of this one. The fruit notes seemed to ""burst"" and had an almost ""juicy"" character. The coating velvety mouthfeel  is one of the best I can recall experiencing. At $60, it's decent VFM. I'm tempted to go 4 1/2, but I'll give it a strong 4 1/4."

4.0,"Nose: Repeating finally gets more apple and fruit than anything with a hint of cereal or chocolate oat underneath. If I had to pin it down, I would say cinnamon spice and candied apple. 

Palate: smooth the whole way, aged well, but difficult flavor profiles. Salted Green apple initially... not very peaty or smoky. Maybe some floral notes but otherwise I got nothin."
