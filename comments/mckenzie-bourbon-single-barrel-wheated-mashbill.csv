P: Huge caramel. Sweet and crisp, expected for a wheater.
F: Dry, and long. Very oaky."
3.0,"very good value for the cost. No big after burn , which is what I like."
4.5,"For those who have read my previous reviews will know that I highly rate the McKenzie BiB release! For me, it's probably the best dollar for dollar Wheated Bourbon that is readily available. So when I had the opportunity to purchase a Single Barrel version of it that is bottled at cask strength and comes with additional aging, I was all in! Let's dive into the specifics of this Bourbon:

It's a Single Barrel release and is age stated at 5.5 yrs

It's bottled at cask strength at 52.5% ABV (that suggests it entered the barrel at a much lower proof than the standard 125 proof)

Mashbill is 70% corn, 20% wheat and 10% Malted barely

It's true grain to glass and all are sourced locally

Let's dive into the tasting:

On the palette it's rich and approaching an oily mouthfeel. Big caramel note with backed apples in the background. Oak and pepper hit on the mid palette leading to a long vanilla, toffee covered cranberries finish with a nice hug. It definitely lingers and is just lovely.

If you like the BiB you will love the store pick. The extra time in the barrel really amplifies the flavors and it's a noticeable step up. It's does come with a $20 premium, however in this case I believe it's truly warranted. The guys over at Liquor Express in Tempe AZ do a fantastic job picking barrels so obviously your experience maybe different, however if you see one I would say you should give it strong consideration! 

Cheers all and Happy Friday!"
