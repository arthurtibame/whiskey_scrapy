4.5,"The color is medium amber with full legs that coat the sides of the glass. The nose starts with charred oak and ripe fruit, then moves on to brown sugar, vanilla, subtle baking spices, creme brûlée and the slightest touch of molasses. The palate is rich and somewhat oily and fills the mouth with charred oak and a bit of ripe fruit, while vanilla and brown sugar come in behind it, while even still creme brûlée and baking spices come in another, subtle wave of flavor. The finish is medium long with charred oak, brown sugar and creme brûlée lingering, while a touch of char fades."
