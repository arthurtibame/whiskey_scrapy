4.25,"The Bladnoch's I've had to date have been average - Samsara and a G&M - so I thought I'd step it up and grab a sample of this to once and for all see if  it was a distillery worth continuing with. This one definitely hits the spot; prunes, plums, blackberry, jammy fruits, strawberry with a nice balance of old leather, tobacco... nice. Wouldn't say it's worth the $250USD purchase price but worth a try if you see it around at a reasonable price. 4 to 4.25."
