4.5,Honey and raisins on the nose and tongue with a bit of grassiness on the finish. Toffee is pronounced from start to finish. I got this from the Whisky Castle in Tomintoul. A rare bottle with excellent character!! The more I taste it I am convinced Granny Smith green apple is present in the flavor of this delightful dram.
