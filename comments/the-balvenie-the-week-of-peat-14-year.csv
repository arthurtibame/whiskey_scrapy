4.0,"It's pretty good.  I get some vanilla on the nose - it's definitely got smoke.

The body is good, this has a good amount of smoke, but it's not a heavy Islay peated  - the smoke is more purely smokey, and it definitely doesn't have the Islay coastal flavor.  It's definitely a peated Speyside - there is a sharp peppery bite to the smoke, followed by caramelized malt- maybe some raisiny notes?  The caramel and the smoke seem to fight in a delightful way during the long finish.  Has some nice honey to it.  Dry oak emerges at the end.

I like this, it didn't impress me at first, but it's grown on me.  I wouldn't seek it out, or hunt for it, but if I saw it on the shelf during a routine visit to the liquor store and there weren't other limited releases, I'd grab a bottle without hesitation."

4.5,"If peat is what you like, then this is the one. It has a very intense smoke flavor and smell. My wife took a whiff and coughed. The smell has a powerful note coming out of the glass- no need to immerse your nose into the glass. Once you taste it, it seems to have a party in your mouth. There are lots of things going on with this. You can taste the smoke, the wood, some spice and it stays with you. Even after a taste, it will send your tastebuds to a new level and they don't want to stop. The next day I was surfing and I could still taste the smoke. I also tasted seaweed and brine- I was in the ocean, but I related it to the whisky. An excellent whisky that seems to be on a different level of intensities than many others. It is one of the best I have had."
4.5,The amount of peat is just perfect.  Nice balance of fruit and spice. For the price this might be the best peated scotch there is.
3.75,"odd name change - and worse new bottling art.  Loved last year's tube with so much info.  Anyway to the whisky.  

Nose - Balvinie's classic honey with a smoke cloud of wonderful fluffy almost marsh mellowy peat behind it.  Has that just touch of oak smoke you get when you roast marshmallows over the fire, only amplified as an intense peated whisky would have. 

Taste - A bit underwhelming after the nose.  Those citrus and honey and vanilla notes over creamy smoked fire.  Such a wonderful mix of sweet and peat.  Think sugar cubes, candy cigarettes,  powdered sugar, and just peat soup.  

I'll have to do a 2003 14 year peat week after this, I think I have another review in me today, to do this one justice in terms of how good it is.  I'm a HUGE fan of these peated casks.  They mix the best of peat and the best of balvenie's sweet malty notes.  

This is both a perfect introduction to peat for those who are new to it and the perfect way to explore peat in a new non islay way for experts.  I thought last year's pour was a master piece and while this seems the same to me, I'm feeling this is just a great whisky.  Thus a 4.0 and we'll see if I do a review of last years if I'll bump it higher.  Either way if you like peat at all, this is awesome and if you don't, this is one to test before moving on from the style all together.  

Did a quick side by side with last year's peat week and I'm dropping the score a quarter point.  It really doesn't hold up next to last years."

3.0,"First opened
No water

Nose - good amount of meaty smoke, underlying sweetness of bright fruit

Taste - strong wood smoke but does not come across as aggressive, oily mouthfeel

Overall - good level of peat, no roughness, but not much else going on.  I would buy again, but not extremely special."
4.5,"In my previous review, I said that I wouldn't go out of my way to get this.  I've changed my mind - this really is a fine whiskey.  If you like smoke and you like sherried Speyside whiskeys, this is one of the the best examples of smokey highland whiskey on the market.  It retails around $100 by me, and it's one of the better scotch whiskeys in the $80-$120 price range.  I'd probably buy a bottle of Laphroaig Lore, Glenmorangie 18, or Old Pulteney 15 over this, but assuming that I already had those, (and I do ;) ), this is next on my list.

The balance on this is quite good - if you like Balvenie and like smoke, definitely pick this up."
3.75,"Nice balance of peat and fruits

Caramel, pear, Apple and peat of course."

4.25,"Wade into the peat smoke. Enjoy it. Now set it aside. Chocolate pudding snack pack, apple pie, and somehow a cinnamon roll (yeah, I said it) on the nose. 

The taste is all the details of creme brûlée. Sweet, creamy, torched sugar on top. A touch of pear towards the back. If you really think about the finish you can tell it’s peated. 

Sweet, sweet, sweet. Probably the kindest peated whiskey I’ve had."
4.5,"Nose: peat.... duh. Get past it and you are met with fresh pears and ocean mist

Palate: creamy, sweet, lemon grass/ citrus, vanilla, smoke

Finish: sugar cubes"

4.25,"Peaty and smoky and a little bit of heat. A nice diversion from the typical Balvenies, which are always good in their own right."
4.0,"As described, strong smoke and peaty in nose and taste. Most impressive was how smooth it was in spite of the aforementioned. (19 Advent19)"
4.25,"This is the third iteration of peated Balvenie that I’ve tried in the last couple of years and by my reckoning the best of the bunch. The peat has a seductively sweet profile and is more overt than I recall on the original 14 year peated edition and the triple cask travel retail version. The palate has the distinct Balvenie honey, well integrated with the smoke. The finish leans to the sweeter notes."
3.25,"Sweet, fruit, pear on the finish. A bit of water really does this well."

1.75,Slightly sweet but very smoky and peaty
4.5,"Nose: earthy, funky, fungal, hints of ashes and smoldering embers, not particularly smoky but definitely peaty
Body: rich, full-bodied, tingly—perhaps slightly salty? 
Palate: peat, peat, peat. Smoke and ash, earthy, like a peat fire in liquid form, very vegetal, like a dense peat fire. Slightly sour/fungal at the back of the palate. Slight hints of salt? 
Finish: a long, damp finish, spicy and salty—dense"

4.0,Lots of peat
4.25,"Not the type of peat you would expect from an islay, but such a nice touch of smoke throughout its course of consumption. On the nose, it’s everything you expect from a classic speyside malt. Caramel, vanilla and toffee with a slight touch of peat but down the hatch it has so many layers to flavoring that I’m going to have to drink another wee dram to disseminate. Update to come soon."
