4.0,I tasted the Brora vs Port Ellen Johnnie Walker Editions head to head last time and the Port Ellen definitely took it. It just had more character more funkiness which I liked. This time round the G&M Editions the Brora came out on top. The character of the PE was still there but it seemed very faded. The Brora however has more substance. Sweet creamy vanilla and a fair bit more (Cascode has it more than covered off!). The casking has been done better on this one. That said however again it didn't blow me away. Very nice dram but not in my top 20% type thing. Nice to have another piece of unblended history. Now onto the Dallas Dhu to finish the ghost trifecta!
5.0,"Distilled 1982, bottled 2015 (Lot #RO/15/01)

Nose: The nose on this whisky cannot be adequately captured in words, and is one of the finest I've experienced.

The curtain opens as beeswax, modelling clay, plasticine, apricot liqueur, musk rose incense, pine needles, ripe peach, old leather, freshly juiced green apples, mint, and vanilla essence make their way on stage.  These actors (and more) perform individually and in groups, sequentially and in parallel, argue, sing in unison, talk over each other, disappear offstage and then reappear from another direction in a carnival of avant-garde sensory delight that seems never-ending. Finally, after about half an hour, the plot becomes clear and the scene settles on a melange of rich fruit pudding fragrances together with orange zest, warm ginger-nut cookies and a waxy brine note. There is the merest echo of delicate smoke wafting about the stage throughout this enthralling opening scene. [The dry glass aroma is leather, vanilla and old fragrant sawdust].

Palate: The palate is a subtle experience, just as complex and diverse as the nose but the characters are more reserved and focused.

This is a recitation delivered by a chorus of mature and dignified characters, calm, authoritative and seasoned, but projecting a suggestion of fierce and spicy youth. Their tale is sweetly spicy and simple as they first arrive, but quickly turns fruity, mineral, oily and nutty and becomes far too intricate to comprehend in one sitting. There is a sense of immeasurable depth and complexity as the story unfolds.  Descriptions of green tea ice cream with baked banana drizzled with a lightly salted caramel sauce are delivered in dusky, musky tones. Coconut, sweet chewing tobacco, beeswax, peach and apricot now appear and the dialogue is regal, refined, richly textured and seductive. [You not only don't notice that this is 46%abv, you don't even notice that it is alcoholic at all, the performance is so riveting].

Finish: Medium. The revels draw to a warm and satisfying denouement, simultaneously gently drying, fruity sweet and redolent of once powerful oak tannins that are now so old they have mellowed into a gentle savory/sweet potpourri. The finale is not especially long but fades perfectly into soft leathery sweetness, leaving a muted but lasting impression of fine mature oak. There is a perfect dryness throughout that balances the sweet flavours. [The dryness is mainly experienced at the tip of the tongue and roof of the mouth].

An unforgettable evening's entertainment.

""Perfection"" : 5 stars."
