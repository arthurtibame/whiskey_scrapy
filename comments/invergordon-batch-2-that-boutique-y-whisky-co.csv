3.5,"To this date, this is by far the oldest whisky i have ever tasted. The sad part: it wasn't good enough. This is a single grain and only 538 bottles were made by an independent bottler called ""that boutique and whisky company"". 

Bottled at 47.7% abv, burnished color.

On the nose it was a little dim and not very interesting. Butter, Salt, Dry grasses, Pretty salty reminds me a little like a talisker, snickers chocolate and old banana notes. The nose was actually the best part and it wasn't special.

On the palate, there are chocolate type of notes: Brownies, butter, Chocolate dry cake. A slight lime note, Clove and pepper very spicy. 

Finish is medium and simple. Water makes it a lot better. Lots of chocolate butter on the palate. I truly recommend adding a couple of drops to enhance this dram.

Without water this dram is a 70 over 100, and with water it goes to a 72 over 100. For 150+ dollars per bottle, forget about this one."
null,"Tastes like something from candy land with notes of caramel, cotton candy, marshmallow, citrus, pepper, vanilla, mango, corn, and floral notes."
