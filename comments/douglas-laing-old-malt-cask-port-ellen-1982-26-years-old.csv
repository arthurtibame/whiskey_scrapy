5.0,"I am so proud about this review. The reason why, is that i have been reviewing whiskies for four years and one that i always wanted to try, was a Port Ellen. I know this is one from an independent bottler, but it has a lot of magic on it. 

For me it was very important to actually had one before the re-opening that is set to occur sometime in the near future, just to taste a dram from a distillery that closed its doors back in 1983, the year i was born. From that moment on, whiskies became a collectors item and prices went crazy. 

I was in this amazing bar in Aberdeen, called the grill, and i saw it. A 26yo, 50%abv islay malt, old malt cask's Port Ellen.

So... how was it? ..... 

It was fantastic. 

On the nose: a super interesting note of ""Box of Cigarretes"". lemon Zest, Oranges, Dry grass. 

Citric, peaty, simple but great. A Lemon note that feels super fancy comes up after first sip. Prunes and LEMON PIE. 

On the palate it was a superb dram: Super smooth; Fancy peat with Mild pepper.
Vanilla, lemon, pepper and Chocolate. Perfect score here.

Afteraste is the most ""normal"" part of this experience, but still a good one. Ginger/peppery spice and hints of peat. Chocolate milk aftertaste.

Overall, this lived up to my expectations, you know that i try to be as objective as i can in my reviews, and this was great and my pre-feelings had nothing to with my score for it which is a solid 96 over 100. Mission accomplished, i had a Port Ellen. Sláinte Mhath!!"
