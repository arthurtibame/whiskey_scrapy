5.0,"One of my all time favorites. I like peaty stuff, and this is peaty for sure, but it is also so much more. Complex is such a cliche word to describe anything with a connoisseur following, but it's perfectly accurate for this whisky. This whisky is for Sean Connery. It's an adult in the midst of other brash, peated, teenagers. Full, leathery, sophisticated, sweet, briny, nutty, sherry, citrus, long finish. The smokiness is always there but plays harmony to the symphonic melodies of everything else you would want in a classic malt. Severely underrated, well worth the $$$$. A bit of heaven with every sniff and every sip."

2.0,"Rubber, smoke, leather, and some dried apricot on the nose. Medium body, with pungent taste of rancid grain and boiled veggies on the palate. Licorice aftertaste on warm and relatively long finish. Complex, but too medicinal for my liking."

3.0,"Peated and medicinal, llmost like opening a box of Band-Aids - that smell of rubber is very pronounced on the nose. I don't dislike it, but I can't say I'm a fan either... unless I'm having a medical emergency. There's honey and clearly phenolic compounds that interact like two children do: one minute they're playing well together and the next minute they're at each other's throat. I'm not sure how I feel about it. However, the finish is where this whisky really shines, with licorice and sherry carrying a fairly long finish."

5.0,"The color is deep amber. The nose is an impression in itself: A light, but consistent rain is falling as I am walking through a woodland setting sometime during the Lenten season. It's one of those existentially rich, pensive moments outdoors where my being and the earth's feel especially uniform to one another. I come upon an ancient, gnarly evergreen, and at its base on the exposed roots there is a bright green tuft of moss. I stoop down to the ground and gently smell the simple scene: the rain-soaked moss, earthy and storied; the old evergreen, sweet, resinous, and vibrant. With time, the arboreal nose evolves into a more classically maritime one. Notes include worn leather, sultanas, tree sap, peat, black peppercorns, balsamic reduction, onion jam, maduro tobacco leaves, and Japanese pine incense. The mouthfeel is balanced, the oak tannins and the oiliness working together seamlessly with the peat flavors. The finish is a wave of salinity, dried chile árbol, fig preserves, and plum skin. When the finish diminishes at long last, sweet peat and light smoke remain on the palate. This malt is a paradox: austere as much as it is mundane. It is definitely one of the most special bottles in my collection."

5.0,"Cheers, Damon! 

The nose is just about perfect. Peat, strawberry, green grapes, red grape skin, toffee, brand new electronics, dried swim trunks after a dip in the ocean, whole grain wheat bread, deep, and rich. The peat doesn't smother the nose, it allows everything else to have a voice.

On the palate there's the white part of celery, stone fruits glaze, green grape, and Italian bread crust. 

This whisky layers your mouth with the perfect amount of peat. The finish brings Brie, and seems to never end.... I can still taste it."
4.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from October 2016. 

Right off the bat this scotch has a thumbs up. 46.3% ABV, natural color of copper gold and non chill filtered. 

The nose is initially very sweet and I am immediately reminded of the Bowmore 15 YO Darkest. Heavy Sherry influence even though it is only finished in sherry casks. Orange peel, raisins, figs, dates. I don't pick up too much on the peat smoke but it is there. Slightly spicy with salty notes. There is a tobacco note once it sits in the glass for a while. Not much oak which is surprising for an 18 YO.   

The palate was quite unexpected after the nosing. Powerful and spicy. The peat smoke shows up but it's not like an Islay peat. This is Highland peat, less medicinal and more herbal. The more you drink, the heavier the peat smoke becomes which is very nice indeed. Sherried fruits are abundant once you get past the spice and peat. 

The finish is medium-long to long and there is an anise/black licorice after taste, but it's very subdued. 

This is what I was hoping for when I bought the Bowmore 15 YO, which was a let down for me. This is a very different type of sherried/peated scotch. The palate is much more balanced than the nose which is very sweet.  Given the price tag, I don't think I would buy a full bottle of this Ledaig. It is complex, but not as much as the Ardbeg Corryvreckan, one of my all time favorites. I don't want to take anything away from this one because it's very good. It just has a little too much Sherry and not enough peat for my preference. 4.25"

5.0,"I usually hold of buying stuff in the +100 euro price range, since there's so much good stuff to explore in  the cheaper ranges, but the impression made by the 10 year old made me decide to try this 18 year old Ledaig anyway. I'm so glad I did!
            It's peatiness is slightly tempered by the extra years of maturation, and while the finishing in ex-sherry cask isn't as obvious as I had feared, it's quite noticable (but likeable). Combine this with some Meaty BBQ Smoke, a hint of dark Chocolate and some moderate Spices, this makes one hell of a dram. Top shelf material from the first sip!
         In a way, it strongly reminds me of the  tasty traditional Volterean dish I had in Italy last year: wild boar with chocolate sauce. And that's definately a good thing :).
    
    Does anyone know the difference between this one, and the seconds batch, though?"

3.75,"Day 22. Damn I'm really late with these. But I'd rather finish my advent calender until the 31st than chug a couple samples until the 24th when I'm just not really up for it. 

Ledaig 18. The 10 was my first tasting note if I remember correctly, and I loved it back then. Even got a bottle of it for my collection just because it was my first try. 

The 18 is a bit of a different beast. For some reason, I feel the peat is more pronounced here, but also more rounded if that makes sense. 

Let's start with the nose. There is a decent peat dose up front, but also a lot of fruityness going on. Pears, apples, berries. Sherry influence maybe? There is also a sweet honey and salt note. I dig it. 

The taste lacks the fruityness of the smell, but in my opinion bumps up the meat. Pepper, peatyness, salty bbq bacon and some grilled apples that still have some of the charred meat from before sticking to them. All in all, very nice, but a tad bitter for my tastes. Not so bitter that I dislike it, but it's on the end of my tolerance for bitterness. I can deal with sweet and salty much better than with bitter. 

Aftertaste is charred, salty meat. Just like after a nice BBQ. 

All in all, a very good entry into the peaty side of things, but for the price I'd still rather grab a bottle of the 10 and a Laphroaig 10. That should be about the same amount of money. 

So yeah, cheers. The last 2 samples are probably coming on the weekend."

5.0,"This is an outstanding Scotch.  Very full bodied with a long, complex finish.  Not sure why others don’t rate higher.  I’ve done tastings with friends comparing to HP18 and Talisker18 and they rate it just as high as I do."
3.0,"I remember with the 10 it was a mild dislike then a love (a few days later) then after a few months back to apathy as the flavours quickly faded away. Given that i decided to judge this on day 2 it really hasn't improved unfortunately. I love a good peated whisky and i could drown myself in the richness of say a Lore. The peat here has more an acidic/bitter sharpness along with heavish salt profile that makes it really difficult to elicit the remaining flavours. Occasionally i get a glimpse of sherry and other aspects such as clove as they suggest. I know how this tale will most likely end, time will not mellow the overpowering aspects of this dram enough for me to enjoy a balance of flavor, and at $140USD a bottle it's a 3. I paired it with the An Oa as they have a certain characteristic they share. Not the same flavor profile but perhaps the sharpness on the tongue. It will be sacrificed to the whisky group session I'm having on Friday although they for the most part weren't willing drinkers of the faded remnants of my 10 year so not sure how it will be received."

5.0,"My second to the last Drinks by the Dram sample (was determined to finish my samples by this year end):  I've never had a Ledaig before, and I figured yesterday's surprise win by the Giants over Dallas called for something new to be opened up!  This distillery really came across to me as a sleeper hit.  I guess Talisker gets all the glory for the Islands, but I'm starting to learn there are others up there as well, just not as popular.   The aroma of this reminded squarely of a Laphroaig.  In fact, when I smelled it, I had to go check my sample vial again to see if I accidentally opened up a Laphroaig.  I got that bandaid, sea-whipped rope smell.   I know that description sounds bad, but it's not...really.  (I tell that to my wife everytime I open up a Laphroaig).  The aroma really reminded me to last year, on a vacation to Norway in the Lofotan Islands.  We stayed in a robruer (fishing hut) in a small village called Reine.  There was this fishing rope hanging outside the hut.  As soon as you step out, you get a whiff of the cold air and briny smell from the sea-whipped rope.  The taste further reminded me of a sherried-Laphroaig or Lag DE.  You're first hit with an orchard of fruits, but really quickly that's taken over by a peaty burnt-ashy taste, with a good dose of red fruit sweetnees (from the sherry cask finish?).  Finish leaves a burnt taste, in a good way...like the charred taste of a well grilled steak topped with mango salsa.   I was really tossing between 4 and 5 stars on this one...I can go either way.  I'm not sure what the full bottle price is (I had a small 3cl sample that I bought earlier this year).    It's good...but, I can probably do just as good for $100 on the Lag DE.  If it's a bit below the Lag DE in price, I'd go for this.  Above the Lag DE in price, I'll choose the Lag DE."

5.0,"Wow wow wow.  I've read reviews stating that drinking this is almost a chore.  Well, sigh me up for more chores, mom and pay me in LeDaig 18 Year Old.

Putting your nose into the Glencairn glass and inhaling deeply rewards you with big, Laphroaig-y smoke, brine and a tease of sweetness.  You expect that first sip to just slam your tongue with medicinal, band-aid and creosote but damn if it doesn't back off and just hit you with a sweet, dark fruit that pops and settles throughout your whole mouth.  The heat shows up lastly and then, BAM!, here's that heavy peat smoke that dominates the long, heavy finish.

This bottle runs just shy of $200 but I promise you, I will be buying another the very next day when I sadly finish this one off.  It hits all the right notes for me and if you enjoy and appreciate the big smoky Laphroaigs but also want the dark fruit and sweetness of a sherry cask finished scotch then give this a go.  A beautiful, beautiful scotch.  Cheers."

4.5,"In the glass welcomes us a magnificent deep copper red, thanks to the final maturation in Sherry, truly a sight.
The sense of smell is (peacefully) invaded by raisins, cloves, orange, a touch of licorice, all supported by a fleshy peat that accompanies without covering. Letting it breathe, there is also a marine whiff with a rubber background (the known problem of water pollution!). A very liqueur and full-bodied profile, almost chewable, soft and rough at the same time, very fascinating.
On the palate the peat explodes in a riot of barbecue sauce and ash, beautiful oily and full, which drips on the tongue together with licorice and herring (!). But let's not forget the fruit, which has been overwhelmed by all this blanket but manages to float and still feel orange and a semblance of (obviously) toasted almonds. The alcohol profile gives the right boost, titillating the walls of the mouth, trying to distract you (in vain) from this roasted tide. At times, it almost resembles an Ardbeg. Almost.
The finish reflects the palate, inevitably of fleshy peat but also herbaceous, ash, rubber, a touch of orange and a light note of spices, all on average long."

4.0,"Tasted from a Tobermory Wee Dram sample pack purchased on the helpful advice of @Richard-ModernDrinking. It’s a great way to explore the range with 5 samples aged from 10 to 19 years and matured in various cask types. Tobermory/Ledaig, Deanston, and Bunnahabhain are three Scottish distilleries that fall under the umbrella of Distell Group Ltd., a South African wine & spirits conglomerate with sales exceeding one billion (US). This particular offering has been polarizing here with ratings from 2 to 5 stars by the Distiller site regulars. Typically released in limited batches, I’ve only been able to track down one remaining bottle of their last batch (#3) in the Boston area. The company only advertises this product as a “Small Batch Spanish Sherry Wood Finish” spirit, but the bourbon/rye influence is very evident, and probably good indication of ex-bourbon barrel maturation. Take your pick of baking spices, but they team up nicely with sherry and leather to predominate the nose and quell any peat smoke rebellion that may be stirring. The nose is also muted in comparison to the Ledaig 10, despite both weighing in at a healthy 46.3% ABV. This is probably attributed to an Oloroso sherry cask finish that can sometimes flatten a nose as well as any prizefighter worth his salt. A viscous palate is greeted with a delightful combination of fruits and spices, and interweaved with enough smoke and sea spray to make for a respectable islander. I would probably rate the Ledaig 10 slightly higher, but I really enjoyed the uniqueness of this whisky and will give it a well-deserved 4.0 stars for overall quality."
3.75,"I had high hopes for this after discovering the greatness of the 10 year old, but sadly it’s badly out of balance on the palate. The nose is wonderful: raisins soaked in orange syrup, a beech plank fresh off the grill and something meaty like truffles or fried liver. It starts off well in the mouth also, with dry orange notes, but that quickly gets swamped by a huge amount of peat. I’ve had Octomores and Supernovas that tasted less peaty, which is bizarre given how age frequently moderates the smokiness. What’s more, it’s a very one-dimensional peat, just a flatline of pepper with no nuance or depth. I didn’t think to add water to this until the very end, as it’s only 46.3% neat, but that did succeed in softening the peat and bringing it more into balance with the orange notes, so perhaps another go around with the benefit of dilution will yield a higher rating. As it stands, it’s not in the same league as the 10, despite the delightful nose."

3.75,"SHERRY before peat in this 2020 bottling, and it's a spicy rather than fruity or sweet kind of sherry. Soft light marzipan/ almonds. Dry walnut shells, dusty malt, dusty bourbon note. Leather. chamomile, dry peppermint / mint, cooling eucalyptus. Oak nuts, oak forest. Pine resin. Orange peels, dates, peach, apricot, lemon peels. Lemon grass. Soft minerality. Chestnuts. Ginger, nutmeg. Floral: daisies, cherry blossoms, lilies, rose petals. East Asian type cooking spices. SAFFRON. cloud berries, rhubarb and gooseberries. Fresh cut grass note. Hay. Nectarines, dried. Anise. Carrots, fresh out of the ground. HORSE RADISH.
 
Cocoa powder. Touch of banana peels. Smoked herring. Black pepper. Pepper steak, bell peppers. Ferns, green shrubs, the pungent scents of early summer burgeoning verdure. Garlic bread sticks. Red and dry black licorice. Balsamic vinegar spices.
Cola cubes. Mixed barbecue spices. Hint of cardamon. White pepper. Curry rice.
With air and a drop of water, vanilla, white grapes.
- slight rancio.

 Aromatic sort of leather shoe store note, that soft elegant leather note you find in an Ardbeg 10, strong at first but it quickly tones itself down: New car smell. Peat and sherry equalize and balance each other out after some time.
Smoked meat peatiness as the bottle gets air. Smoked bacon.
Not fishy or particularly tarry; only mildly coastal.

- A noticeable but not overwhelming presence of sulfur, which some people have issues with. And it must be said, there's quite an in-your-face wet cardboard note. A drop of water and especially aeration mitigates this: with enough air a distinct tiger balm note half takes over, then also barbecue spice, salt & pepper potato chips.

It is clear that the Tobermory distillers have attempted to mask a somewhat rough spirit with the sherry here, but it will, with a bit of patience, turn into a properly gratifying experience."

4.0,Decent. Didn’t have with ice which might have taken the edge off. Excellent aroma.
1.5,"Even if I didn’t really like this whisky, I’m still glad I tasted it. It wasn’t a negative experience but also not a positive one as well. The really present and straight forward peat on this one wasn’t for me but I can understand that this might be really enjoyable to others who like peat-heavy whisky. 

The nose overwhelms you directly with a peat that doesn’t smell burned though. What I got from it was tobacco and raw earthy peat. And it also comes with a very intense waxed leather smell - a bid like when you open a box of new suede boots. A bid chemical almost - and medicinal. 

The palate is more relaxed first. When you get behind the peat you find some molasses, licorice and also some Marmite first but this quickly gets overshadowed by tobacco ash tastes, that aren’t very pleasant. It tastes like a wet ash tray smells. This bid is what made this whisky fail for me. Everything else was still quite enjoyable but the aggressive ash on the taste which sticks to your tongue for a very long time, just was too much."
