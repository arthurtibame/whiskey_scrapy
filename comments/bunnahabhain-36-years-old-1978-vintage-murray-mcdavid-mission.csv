4.5,"A very old Bunnahabhain, bottled by the independent bottler Murray McDavid. A very nice expression from a company which i really never heard before. It says cask #001.

Bottled at 50.4%abv

On the nose, rice, soap. Refined raisins, figs, butter and caramel. This is a so-so aroma. I gave it 21 over 25.

The palate was great though. Milk powder with waves of different chocolates. I have a sweet tooth so, perfect score here.

Aftertaste is also very good and rewarding. Figs and dried fruits. No spiciness at all. 

Overall another old great dram. Not all old whiskies are good, but this one is. 95 over 100."
