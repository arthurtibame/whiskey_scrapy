5.0,"Aroma is scotch, there's some much going on in the aroma that it's hard to pick out any single aroma.  But the taste is where it shines, it's soft and tasty.  I'm a fan of Irish whiskey and this is soft as the Irish blends.  It glides over the palette and tickles the taste buds. The smoked peat comes through the tongue and the nose.  A quick finish.  Price wise it's a winner for all the good things.  Pick up a bottle and try it neat of course."

4.0,For the money this is a very good weekday sipper. The smoke is just about perfect. Not incredibly sophisticated on the palate but eminently drinkable and I don’t hesitate making a sour with it or offering it to occasional whiskey drinkers when they come by.

2.0,"Nose: green apple, a bit of caramel

Palate: vanilla caramel sweetness, something in the middle, then smoke, nail polish remover

Finish: long finish with increasing bbq sauce flavour

Score: 5"
3.0,"Nose:  sweet, mild peat, a little bit of malt, mild spice, very little of the grain alcohol astringency
Palate:  mild peat, spicy, sweet, a little bit of malt
Finish:  medium length, spicy, a little bit of peat, kind of a toffee/oak flavor
Overall a lot better an more complex than I was expecting for a $23 blended scotch.  A lot of similarities to Johnnie Walker Black, which is what it appears they were going for.  Without trying them side by side it’s hard to say which I like better, but the John Barr I think is a better value since it’s about $15 less."
3.0,"Color: The color I find on this blended scotch is a light maple syrup. Its legs stick to the inside of the glass pretty well despite how thin they are.

Nose: The nose shows off notes of honey, caramel, and cinnamon. It also has notes of smoke and popcorn.

Taste: The palate is pretty simple with small notes of dried mango, strawberry Twizzler candy, white tea, and vanilla ice cream.

Finish: The finish is much like how a speech at a wedding should be - short, sweet, and syrupy.

Thoughts: My first impression of this scotch after my first smell and sip was, “Dang! I like this!” It isn't complex, but it is delicious and has zero burn. It's a great casual sipper for conversations with friends! I haven't tried but I wouldn't add ice to it; it may disappear. I would buy this one again! Thanks, John, for raising the Barr! Sláinte!"
2.0,"Nose is piney. Color is light, caramel. Fairly smooth."

3.0,John Barr Blended Scotch is a must have on hand for me. First off the price point is terrifying at $35 for 1.75L. One would expect something very rushed and rough. This scotch is very deceiving though. While this is not a highly refined drink it is however very drinkable. It has the flavor profile of a mild scotch with very little smoke. But will also appeal to the irish whisky drinking friend by having a slightly sweet and buttery finish. The blend seems to fall pleasantly in the middle of both courts. Not a good choice for the first drink of the night but great to have around for the all night laugh sessions.

1.0,"I figured I would give it a go, but was sadly disappointed. The nose was spicy, floral, with hints of leather. This was not Smokey! The middle was barely drinkable and for a scotch, tasted more like a Kentucky bourbon, but some how off. The finish was barely noticeable, which was a good thing. If you’re into a bargain or interested in trying different whiskeys and scotch, give it a try. To each their own! Best of luck!"

3.0,"Look: a nice orange color, alcohol legs and lacing are abundant

Nose: Initially I get the sweet pear honey note, and then some slight smoke akin to pipe tobacco and peat. Pick up toffee a bit too, like a heath bar. Swirling gives me more pear. 

Taste: initial taste is actually like peat, pepper, honey and pear. This is better than I’d have figured. 

Finish: dry, hot, and that tobacco, maybe leather note sticks with me. I get astringent notes from the barrel

Overall:  Color me surprised. This is actually pretty good. The slight complexity brought by the addition of peated malts makes this worth a pour."

3.0,"Honey-colored orange decent Gecko-foot legs.

Redolent of Butterscotch and sea salt in the nose; just a mild hint of barrel char and sherry sweetness, but it's enough to balance out the sweetness. A dry nuttiness and some buttery shortbread. White pepper and toffee.

It's a very buttery flavor: Butterscotch,  shortbread, with more brine and toffee. It has a slick, buttery feel.

The finish pivots over to barrel tannins and sherry richness. I am starting to find the chocolate notes in the finish of these also, which here manifests itself as bitter semi-sweet chocolate chips. This is a very solid value for $30."
