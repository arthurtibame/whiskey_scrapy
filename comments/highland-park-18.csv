4.75,"very nice. The perfect blend of smooth, soft peat, and good overall taste. bought a bottle that i've been staring at for a year for $139. Worth it? Hell yes. Problem is that its too good. i could drink a few glasses neat in one sitting, and at that price its a dangerous combination. Love it."

The withdrawal of the wave leaves a surprisingly strong smoky and peaty taste one would not expect of a bottle of this age. D(r)amn, this is good. Now excuse me while I return to reality."

I definitely get the apple taste and an almost honey laced smoke on the palate.  Then onto a “zing” I can’t even describe but only one that I’ve tasted with this.  A strange numbing quality that sticks to the top of your mouth and makes you eager for another sip.  

I think this what inspired ZZ Top’s song about legs.    Longer than Kate Middleton 

In all honesty, I’m not sure if my palate was ready for such an experience but this makes you want to try out for the big leagues and fail happily."

5.0,"Highland Park 12 is one of my all time favorite whiskeys.  It's no surprise that it would be dethroned by an older version of itself.  This whiskey is sublime- the palate feels like a tug-of-war between heather, honey, and smoke.  The flavors come and go like lapping waves.  Speaking of waves, this has got wonderful ocean notes, but they are hard for me to pull out with so much else going on, though they are definitely there. The finish is long and lingering, it's got waves of smoke that roll across your tongue.  There is a hint of dry wood, but it hides in the background, which is usually the way that I prefer it.  Dark chocolate emerges late.  The nose is every bit as enjoyable as the palate, full of complexity.

Is this a perfect whiskey?
No.
Just kidding, it really is.
I seldom spend over $100 on a bottle, as I generally feel that despite being very good, I could probably find more overall enjoyment spread out over a few cheaper bottles.  This one is worth the price.  If I were independently wealthy, this would be my daily drink - I'd buy this by the case."

4.5,"info: Je me sens presque indigne de relater les principales informations de ce monstre. Plusieurs le considère comme le meilleur whisky au monde (Paul Pacult dans son Spirit Journal). Enfin, les attentes sont haute lorsque l'on se met à lire sur ce produit. Sommairement, il s'agit d'un assemblage de fûts de sherry et de fûts de bourbon. Le produit a été redesigné en 2017 mais il s'agit toujours du même produit mais avec un nouveau nom ""Viking Pride"". Nombreuse récompense alors je me contente de nommé la dernière: Gold en 2018 par The Scotch Whisky Masters pour la catégorie Highlands & Islands 13-18 years old.

Nez: C'est presque cliché de le dire mais définitivement caramel-salé. Floral. Des fleurs de vanille. Miel croustillant. Me parait cireux mais c'est l'impression laissé par la légère, très légère fumé.

Bouche: Ouais... je vois. C'est rond. C'est rond rond rond. Pas de coins qui dépasse. Parfaitement équilibré. Les saveurs sont parfaitement en harmonie. Crème de vanille, yahourt avec du sirop, une fumé qui fait désormais pensé à un café fraichement moulu (l’odeur humé en bouche lorsque fraichement moulu). Définitivement des notes de caramel et de sel (c'est probablement ce qui a de plus facile a percevoir en fait). Un miel. Un miel croustillant style honeycomb. Cette fumé, un peu plastique, est exactement au même niveau que l'ensemble du bouquet (c'est rare!). Notes d'agrumes qui tardent un peu vers la fin quand la chaleur de l'alcool refait surface (car jusqu'ici c'était complètement absent). Texture impeccable. 

Finale: Sur ce long miel sucré et floral et cette fumé plastique. 

Overall: Je suis capable d'apprécier la complexité et la finesse d'exécution. Superbe complexité et presque impossible d'exécuter mieux ce bouquet d'arôme. Je vous avoue que ce qui me bloque à apprécier pleinement ce whisky c'est cette fumé plastique typique de la distillerie que l'on retrouve dans tous ses produits. Mais, ça c'est plus une question de gout personnel. J'aime le produit détrompez-vous. C,est frais, rond et définitivement un must à goûter dans sa vie d'amateur de whisky. Tout cela pour dire que je comprends l'engouement mais ne le partage peut-être pas au même point. 90%"

5.0,"Delicate apricot and peach on the nose with a hint of brine, oak, and chocolate. Fruity character plays well with a hint of smoke and caramel on the back. Pallet is complex, with smoke coming out first, and sweetness and fruit developing later. Sweetness is intermingled with salty notes, and all tied well together with delicate peat and fruit. Aftertaste is light smoke with ripe fruit and caramel notes. A few drops of water develops more sweetness and freshness. Overall very smooth, complex, and satisfying. One of the best complex whiskeys."

Nose: Sweet tea, mushrooms, put out camp fire, sea salt, chocolate.

Taste: fruit, black tea, cherry, walnuts.

Experience: Eating a chocolate by a now wet fire pit. 
It is a very well balanced whiskey which is great but to be honest it's little brother the 12 is also fantastic and for a fraction of the price. if the dropped this to $80 I would recommend it more readily."

4.25,"At the nose a lot of smell can be discovered. At first a bit smoky (not peated) and salty. Then vanilla, fruits (with a big apple smell) cream.
First slip is incredibly sweet and smoky flavours get into the mouth. Medium-full body. Oily and salty of sea algae.
Adding some water drops (not too much because it is already great without and sweet no matter the ABV) helps increase the salty smell at the nose unfortunately we loose the very good fresh cut apple smell.
At the palate it gets more oily (which I personally like) and a bit more fruity.
The smoky taste disappears a bit for a peppery finish.
Not the best whisky I've had but a very good one nevertheless"

With no water, it's a touch hot but also very satisfying. it doesn't burn badly and has a lot of flavor even with the heat. WOW, a drop of water sets off the non solubles like crazy, hot and firey. with about 4 half straw fulls of water, the nose is distinctly smokey, hint of heat of you go real deep but also fruit and rich. that first taste then is much much smoother, very dynamic, hot on the tongue for a moment but complex and reminds of liquorice? fully watered, about 6 straw fulls, nose is very light and floral. the taste is crazy smooth and slightly smokey, hint of sweet and caramel dried fruit. very very very good"

Once again I must thank @LeeEvolved for this wonderful sample! I really enjoyed the 12 and Dark Origins and am eager to see how this one stacks up. Let's find out:
Upon entry it's pretty silky and lighter than I expected. The initial notes are strawberry and raspberry jam with malt cereal. A hint of smoke in the background. Mid palette has spice, toasted marshmallows and nutmeg. Finish is long and features oak, cinnamon, black pepper with peat undertones. My goodness there is a lot going on here and honestly it's changes a bit with each sip. Some sips are fruitier and others smokier. 
I was expecting more of a flavor bomb and instead you get a delicate and very complex dram.
Thanks again @LeeEvolved, you have now added 2 bottles to my purchase list! Cheers all!"

3.75,"HP 18 - 43% so chill filtered and well more or less a mixed drink with gallons of unneeded water poured over it.  But I guess some people like scotch and water so more or less this is a premade mixed drink.  

Nose - baked pie crust, sherry fruits, butter, a touch of nutty notes.  The nose is extremely neutrally balanced sweet without being overly sweet, a bit of that bready character bringing down the sweet, some sherry fruits but the malts are middling.  There's a touch of savory elements as well.  Balanced is the word here.

Taste - More of the same with the nose.  Vanilla and dough open, then some sherry notes come through, followed by some spices and oak.  The finish brings out some very light peat and some salt, but extremely subtle.  

I'm not sure where some of these insane scores are coming on this one.  This is very likely a few years old as I bought it a year ago and the store kept these in the back.  It's a perfectly balanced whisky.  It's complex, well made, and if they'd just up the ABV to 46 we might have a real winner.  Still, I think this is just short of one to chase down.  It's a great way for someone to start with scotch and to see what they like or don't like as there's a little of everything here."

3.5,"While the rating suggested an outstanding experience with this 99-rated dram, I was left really searching for the flavors outlined. The peat was subtle and drinking neat didn’t provide many “wow” factor moments. Ice Cube required."
4.75,"The nose starts smokey but is immediately followed by a fruity sweetness, along with vanilla, caramel, straw and brine all wonderfully intermingling. It is gently on the palate but rich, filling the mouth with a fantastic peatiness and following it with brine and salted caramel, oak, straw and a bit of pepper. The finish is medium long with a lingering peatiness while salted caramel, brine, ripe fruit and oak all nicely fade."

5.0,"While I can’t quite meet the same level of class as @PBMichiganWolverine ‘s hotel tastings, on a recent business trip I got up the gumption to visit a hole in the wall liquor store nearby to see if they had any hidden “treasures”. This was the kind of the hole in the wall (or window into the sewer) establishment that had iron bars over any sort of opening into the premises, salacious ads for women posted everywhere, abrasive clientele, and an eerie aura that made you seriously ponder why you rolled up there in the first place. Actually.... what was I doing there?

So this was going to be a quick stop. Nonchalant speed perusing, speed perusing...overpriced Japanese whisky....nonchalant speed perusing....overpriced Irish whiskey...1 bottle of Blanton’s (overpriced)....and 1 beat up bottle of Highland Park 18 (w/o any Viking’s Pride). For $110. 

Now, there are probably some people who live in markets where this isn’t a big deal. Maybe this happens for them all the time? But I come from a bad whisky market. So I was immediately gleeful and forced to hide my glee because I might tip off the shopkeep that he hadn’t visited this shelf in a while (judging from the other prices in that place, this bottle had been overlooked for some time) and remind him that he had seriously undervalued something in the process. 

I take my prize up there like it was a bottle of Jack, and he stares me down when he sees that faded, yellowing sticker. Did I switch tags on him? Did this chick know what she just carted up to the counter? Should he refuse to sell it to me?

He didn’t. But he did charge me an extra $5 for a bogus service fee that it seemed he was daring me to take issue with. (I did warn you this was a slimy establishment...)

In any case, I escape. Back to my hotel room, where I am going to enjoy this delicious bottle of perfectly-aged Scotch in a subpar hotel glass because I haven’t tasted it in so long. 

Until the cork breaks off when I try I open it. Ugh, my luck! (No, I did not yank on it...)

Nevertheless, she persisted. 

I fish it out of there with some creative toothpick placement and pour the first dram of Highland Park 18 I’ve smelled in much too long. 

Delicious. And while I’d love to regale you with my hotel tasting notes and equally enthusiastic “TL;DR” attempts to get an 18 year old bottle of Scotch with an AWOL cork home, I won’t. And will instead just tell you that I did manage it, and I can now provide you with notes from a proper tasting performed in the comfort of my own home.

Nose: Fragrant and elaborate, yet mild-mannered. Delicate floral notes and peak-season farmers market fruits are elegantly married to sea spray, moss, earth, and sweet smoke on a restrained holiday. It has the aromatic intensity of a perfectly brewed cup of herbal tea with a drop of smoked lemon for balance. I don’t want to stop nosing it, it evolves a bit every time you sit and visit with it. 

Palate: Smokey creme brûlée, stewed fruits, lemon meringue pie, woody nutmeg spice, morel mushrooms, heather, and refined, mossy peat.  A lovely succession of sweets and cream, tart and lightly salted fruits, barrel astringency, and smoke. It may be a bit light-bodied for palates accustomed to heavy-hitting Islay’s, but it has a wonderful mouthfeel and texture and the malt shines through. Unimaginably smooth and balanced. There’s nothing to add or subtract. 

Finish:  Long, sweet, caramel smoke with the faint reminders of quality time in barrels. You can still taste this minutes later and it will probably season your pores for hours later. 

To me, this bottle is a rare success of the aged, mossy peat pairing perfectly with time spent in quality Sherry casks - you don’t always need a sledgehammer of peat nor a tsunami of wine. This isn’t the profile of your next door neighbor’s barbecue pit char stirred into your Speyside either, this is the incense of something delicious cooking a few streets over and you have to know what it is they’re enjoying. If you could bottle the essence of mountains and meadows with the harvests of late summer and barrel it in a seaside vacation campfire, this may be what you end up with 18 years later.

4.5,"Found one of the old style bottles sitting around the store and decided to pick it up. The 12 year old was my first single malt so I’m excited to try this one.

Nose: sherry influence is obvious. Fruits like apple and pear are present. Also a distinctly brandy note is there. Unlike the 12 the smoke takes quite some time to find on the nose.

Palate: Sherry nuttiness and honey are first. Next comes the apples then brine. At the very end is more ash than smoke, but a slight amount of that peat influence is there.

Finish: The sweet and fruity notes fade almost immediately. The brine lingers only slightly longer leaving you with the ash. This stays for a medium amount of time before the finish ends.

I enjoyed this quite a bit, although I’m certain part of that is the nostalgia of the 12 year old being my first single malt. Is it worth the $130 entry fee? For me yes, as the malt is certainly quality and gives you a bit of everything as far as tasting notes are concerned. If you prefer sherry bombs or peat monsters you will likely find this disappointing, but in my experience it is wonderfully balanced and is definitely recommended.

Sláinte!"

4.25,"Highland Park's excessive abuse of the Nordic mythology is really putting me off. However, let's review the old HP18, not the Edrington marketing dept. Very dense and round, the nose unfolds with orange peel, creamy toffee and subtle peat smoke. Apricots, heather honey and cloves emerge from the back. After a sweet and sour arrival, the palate develops with a complex array of flavors. Dried fruits, spices and oak take turns with ginger, mint and hints of coffee. Slightly dry and ashy, the medium finish fades. This great malt doesn't need any Viking BS!

5.0,"It is believed that Highland Park was founded by either a farmer, David Robertson, or by a priest turned smuggler, Magnus Eunson, in 1798. As with much history pertaining to distilleries in Scotland prior to late 1800's, not much is recorded officially and has an air of folklore surrounding it.
Just like most major Scottish distilleries, Highland Park has changed ownership multiple times but unlike many others, it has never been shuttered or mothballed.
In 1999, it became part of Edrington brands, which also owns Macallan, Glenrothes, Cutty Sark, and The Famous Grouse.
Peat from different regions imparts different flavors to malted barley as it dries. Highland Park uses Orcadian peat, which is composed of sphagnum moss and heather. This peat imparts lightly smoky and much more fragrant flavors than mainland or Islay peat. Highland Park mash consists of 20% of their own peated malted barley (though I've also heard that only half of their own malted barley is actually peated) and 80% of unpeated malted barley brought in from mainland Scotland. The 18 Year expression was introduced in 1997 and uses ex-Oloroso sherry casks.
The result is one of my favorite whiskys.
On the nose there is nectarines, peaches, and apricot (stonefruit), sweet smoke, green apples, and citrus with honey. On the palate there's the same jammy, sweet fruit flavors along with a hint of earthy, mushroom notes, followed by fragrant smoke that finishes long and sweet with a bit of tartness.
This is a must have bottle for any whisky fan!"

4.0,"Served neat in a Glencairn glass from a new, full bottle.  September 2017 batch 17/A211

Dark chocolate truffles and subdued German pastries underly the smoked apple-wood on the nose.

Mouth-feel is a little lighter than I normally prefer, but oh-so-silky.

The smoke is noticable right off the bat, but it unfolds like a Russian ballet.  The smoke is sweet dark chocolate make a comeback, with the chocolate taking on a dark-roast latte characteristic and undertones of BBQ ribs.  Honey, tobacco and very subtle iodine all make appearances.  After a few seconds, there is tart apple and tangy blood-orange.  All the while the smoke is still going.  The finish is akin to a campfire several hours after being out out, with a sweet citrus/milk-chocolate truffle note that gently peters out in a dry, yet salivating, elegant fashion.

This dram is complex, yet immenently approachable.  It is bold, yet sensual.  Compared to the Talisker 18 I just opened, it lacks that last bit of refinement.  Unfortunately, The Naked Grouse replicates 90% of the profile with only the faintest rough edge, and does so for 1/5 of the price."

4.0,"Lots of apple and honey and more noticeable smoke on the nose than the 12yr version. The cereal is also very noticeable, with the slightly dark floral notes and a hint of toffee. The sherry influence is fairly subtle with only slight fruit notes coming through the honey and smoke. All in all, the nose is fairly short. Just like the 12, the smoke is much more prominent than the nose would suggest. The sweetness is less present as well, with the smoke being slightly charred and salty. There is a slight seaweed quality to the middle of the palate, which is replaced by some earthy notes that flirt with being fruity. I have seen mushrooms listed as a tasting note, and I could see this middle note being what I'm finding there. There is an interesting minty quality behind the earthiness that keeps the palate from being too salty or too dark, while still keeping some of the fruity elements. The smoke turns slightly ashy but more peppery and less dry than the 12yr. The finish is not particularly long and ultimately is slightly minty with a fair amount of cereal. Just like the 12, it leaves me feeling like I smoked a cigar an hour ago, albeit with less of a mouth-watering quality to it. I actually prefer the 12yr in the end, although this is by no means a dissatisfying experience."

On the nose, as soon as you remove the cork you will nose that stinky very noticeable orkney peat. Caramel, sweaty shoes (lol but true), salt, prunes. 

On the palate it is very complex. A herbal liquorice note very impressive, never had one like that. Typical tobbacco note from Highland Park, but more elegant that other expressions; spicy, chilli, smoke. 

Finish medium very pleasant. Smoky. Charred.

5.0,"Highland Park 18 is a peated Single Malt Scotch from the northern most region of Scotland. This spirit is matured for 18 long years, staying consistently cool in the Orcadian air, in some of the finest sherry oak casks from Spain. Highland Park 18 is made of 100% malted barley and smoked using peat from the island. It is quite a unique whisky that is consistently well balanced and smooth. Bottled at a pleasant 96 proof/43% ABV, Highland Park 18 proves itself, time and time again, being a dram anyone can enjoy.

Color: Burnt Gold

From the time I saw those nice legs streaming down the side of the glass to the long and warming finish, Highland Park 18 was excellent in almost every aspect. It starts with some nuttiness, red fruit sweetness, marzipan, dark chocolate, and some peat smokiness on the nose. The sweetness and smokiness were perfectly balanced. On the palate were more intense sherry notes with red fruit sweetness such as cherry, oak, toffee, honey, all spice, dark chocolate, and more smoke. Again, the balance was amazing. However, the texture was a little thicker (creamy) than I would like. The finish is long, smooth and gentle with more of that superb balance of peat smoke and sherry sweetness."
