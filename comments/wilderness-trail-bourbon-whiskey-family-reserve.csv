4.0,"Vanilla nose, heat at first but finishes off nicely with pepper. Decent pick cask strength may want to open up with a drop of water. """

3.5,"Nose: vanilla, toasted marshmallows, corn

Palate: some ethanol but that quickly fades to mint, hints of maple syrup and more vanilla

Finish: medium, but that’s more due to the ethanol proof and not the complexity of flavors

The 2018 Wilderness Trail bottled in bond was great. It was akin to Makers 46. This single barrel pick (Liquor Barn, 2019, #4 char, Rickhouse B W0107, yeast strain FermPro-1) is lackluster compared to last years BiB release. Will revisit."
