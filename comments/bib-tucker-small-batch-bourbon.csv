3.0,"$55 - Michigan. Nose (Neat): Leather, nutty, woodsy, alcohol, light vanilla and a soft sweet note. Nose (Ice Ball): Leather opens up to leather and tobacco. Lighter nut, alcohol and oak notes. Vanilla and sweetness are more noticeable. Slight floral note now present. Palate (Neat): First sip provides a medium burn from tongue to chest. Second sip moves on to a leather and toasted oak, followed by vanilla, anise, floral and a slight sweet kiss. The viscosity of the whiskey coats the mouth nicely, so the vanilla and sweet notes build throughout the glass to catch up to balance with the other flavors. Finish is smokey sweet. Note - I prefer this over ice to cut the burn and strength of all the flavors. It softens all the flavors, but all are still very present to enjoy."

3.0,"Very bold and rough flavor. Spicy and full of leather notes. Not smooth and refined enough for a regular consumption but nice to have for unique occasions. I wouldn't go out of your way to buy it but if it's staring at you on the shelf in the $50 range, pick it up.  Some may want to buy it just because the bottle looks cool and very vintage."

3.0,"I think the liquor store put this as an employee favorite to get it off the shelf.  This whiskey is made with cheap ingredients.  I like that thay are going for a lightly toasted barrel.  Hopefully the whiskey is not aged in LA.  If so, that would explain the taste.  I think some heavy filtering and more ageing with lightly toasted oak just might help.  In 10 years I'll taste again.  I got a very nice $50 bottle.  I don't need another."

Nose:  First hits you with chocolate which is pleasing but then gives way to a grassiness that wrecks hit.

Palate:  A bit of rye and immature oats.  Some cherry and wood but kind of all over the board.  I think this is a very young bourbon at best

Finish:  a bit medicinal.  stays the same throughout.  nothing to write home about.

At 46.99/ bottle I kind of felt ripped off.  better stuff for half the price is just waiting to be bought"

2.0,"Wife bought it for the cool bottle. This is a very unusual bourbon. It is thin, with more wood than char on the nose. Forward taste is sweet spice, with a sour aftertaste that leaves a pleasant linger. Later tastes are dominated by sweetness, but the sweet/sour clash remains. 
    
This bourbon has multiple personalities. Other reviews are bimodal, with strong love/hate camps. I find myself in both. One day, a neat dram is a disaster. The next day, it is a delight. I found my most successful pours with a little ice. 

If it were half the price, I'd give it three stars. I have to knock one down because is it far too expensive for what it is. The bottle *is* cool, though. I may make a desk lamp out of it."

This is a really good looking bottle and have always been interested in trying it. Reviews are mixed and with a bottle costing $60 and it not being easily found at bars, I have never had the chance to taste this... until now!
In a nutshell, they saved me $60! This is an extremely spice Bourbon and not in a good way. Huge spice swell upon entry that never really recedes. Hard to get past it and it's a but unbalanced. It's like a poor man's 4 roses for almost double the price. Hard pass at this price point."

The bottle is fancy, I'll give it that, but the contents inside are lacking for a bourbon priced at $55. It has a decent nose, the body is very young and could stand a few more years aging in the barrel. The tail burns and lingers. If they cut the price in half I would score it higher. If it were aged longer it might be worth the price, but there are a lot of really good bourbons that blow this away for under $50
I let my son drink most of it at the reception and I used the rest deglazing my cast iron skillet for sauces"

3.25,"I admit that upon initial tasting, perhaps I'm rating this a tad too high. At $55 here in PA, this whiskey is not exactly punching above it's weight class. It is an underwhelming whiskey. Listed at 92 proof but does drink as smoothly as baby's milk and pretty near as sweet. Yet overall for the money, in terms of taste and hit, the asking price definitely is out of line. 

What this whiskey does do well is go down so easily, you don't even feel you are drinking whiskey. The nosing reveals little with definition but I'll go with Brock's description just for the Hell of it. I do really like the soft minty aftertaste, like the gum you've chewed too long but you just like what it does for your breath. This 6 yr has a decent finish but lacks any complexity. 

I guess liquors like this serve a purpose, in this case mainly being something that can both be sipped innocuously or desperately tossed down during viewing something like an impeachment hearing when there's nothing else on.

As a comparison, for half the price in PA there is the Jim Beam Distiller's Cut which only has availability against it. Nose, taste and finish are far superior. The Bib & Tucker is like paying double for Beam but getting the Devil's Cut instead of the Distiller's.

Not much of a recommendation but then not all whiskeys need one when utilized properly. Don't think I'll repeat but purchases on whims are often like that.

$54.99 at the PLCB"

3.5,Not bad would buy again.
4.0,"Nose: Full frontal sugar rush that combines Maple syrup and vanilla with a pop of cinnamon.

Palate: A lathering warm embrace by notes of caramel and vanilla followed by an exhale of mild fruit and spice.

General: A great bourbon for the whiskey tasting nights with friends and family."

3.0,It’s good but not worth the price ($50)
3.5,"First two sips I thought 'crap, I just paid $50 for this', but the more I had, the more I liked. A pastoral sweetness, interesting spices, and a nice minty finish. Another reviewer used the term 'dank' - yes, I get that, and I'm ok with it - it works.  I'd feel more comfortable paying $40, although I wouldn't be surprised if I buy this again. It's very unique, smooth, and enjoyable."

4.0,Great caramel nose but then doesn’t taste much like it smells. I get spicy and fruity flavors and it’s fills the mouth with hot flavor but then settles down and doesn’t burn going down.  Reminds me a bit of Ryes.
4.5,Great sipper with little burn.
3.5,"Packed with flavor.  An initial heat that is quickly overtaken by a nice charred, tobacco flavor with hints of vanilla & floral.  Not bad to keep at the home bar for guys night, but many better options for the price."

4.25,"Unique bourbon. A bit herbal and floral notes on the nose with a balanced sweetness of vanilla and fruit. Lighter bodied with a refreshing finish.
A bit expensive, but worth it once in awhile."

4.25,Simple on the nose and first on the palate.  Slight kick as the flavor profile quickly rolls past on the way to a smooth finish.  Post sip lingers on the back of the tongie for some time.

3.0,"The nose is nice and rounded. There are sweet dried fruit notes with a hint of raspberry syrup. Rich toffee, some wood, a hint of chocolate. The flavors don't hit you in the face, but they balance nicely. It smells sweet and tasty. The palate has more of a dry mineral rye note than expected that comes right out, but it fits nicely with the fruitiness. Some nice sweet fruit makes its way out in short order - the raspberry playing a starting role without tasting particularly tart. The balance is nice with the wood coming in with an earthy clover presence that brings in soft tannins without being too numbing. It's always sweet on the finish and there's just enough heat to keep up the cinnamon profile and keep it from tasting flat. The mouthfeel is moderate and helps to make up for some of the light flavor. There's a nice balance in here, though it isn't terribly interesting. It's a bit like watered-down Booker's, though perhaps with a little more cohesion and subtlety. A little tobacco and eucalyptus come in at points, but they are quite mild. I just wish it had a bit more distinction to its flavors and some more robustness to its flavor. It definitely tastes like a blended whiskey. That nice low burn keeps it alive though. When I come back to it after a dip of water though, I realize that I'm really grasping for those complexities. It's quite flat and disappointingly weak. It definitely reminds me of somewhat sweeter (and better) Evan Williams. It's definitely sippable, but not a big success. It's too light for sure - it definitely doesn't taste 6 years old."
