3.25,"Sweet and very complex. Brief spice that fades into vanilla and caramel and then comes back. Peanuts - can’t place the aroma, but it’s present. Not a high-rye guy but I do enjoy this and definitely can see this being in the bar frequently"

3.0,Cinnamon and spice. Bit of a hug to follow but lots of flavor and spice.
3.0,"Tasted in a plastic hotel room cup. 

Nose is spice, brown sugar, and bright lemon. 

Taste is spice and refreshing lemon. 

Has a thick syrupy mouth feel."

3.75,"Nose: soft cherries, not a heavy nose. A bit of caramel, very much a classic bourbon nose though

Palate: very light like a scotch. A little sweet but thin. Caramel. Drinks well for 100 proof. 

Finish: medium/short very soft caramel"
