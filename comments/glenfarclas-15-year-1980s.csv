4.5,"This was the warm up dram for the rare and old bottling session at Dramfest. Two things almost made me choke, when I was posting this and one when I tasted it.

Firstly the tasting. I'm not a fan of Glenfarclas..I find their stuff very light like they have reused their casks to an inch of their life..well let me tell you this isn't how they used to do it. Best Glenfarclas by miles. Rich sherry and perfect balance and that was after a CS Benromach.

The two things that made me choke posting? The price is nearly $800USD and it is artificially coloured..."
