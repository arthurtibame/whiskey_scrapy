5.0,"Nose is buttery and fruity, almost floral.

A mouthful of wow. Carmel ,vanilla and barrel char. Just everything your hope for.  Some spice in there as well, which is odd for er"

5.0,"An absolutely amazing whisky. Not as strong of burn on the finished as EHT Barrel proof. The perfect amount of oaky, nutty, sweet caramel."
4.5,"Caramel on caramel. You can smell this pour from a mile away. Marshmallow heat, not terrible thick though, drinks incredibly smooth, almost too smooth."
