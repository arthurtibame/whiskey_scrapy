4.5,"Maple brown sugar nose, grass, smoke, vanilla, unique flavor"
3.25,"Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose is full of spice, but not sharp, with notes of freshly baked cherry and apple pies, along with some rounded vinous notes.  Interesting.  Taste brings out more of the vinous character, which lends some bitterness to the baking spices, along with some orange peel and clove.  I don't love it, but it is unique and I am sure others with different taste preferences could really dig it.  3/11/2020"
3.5,"Nose grape cherry pear cinnamon. Pallet falls short from the nose, rye for sure, thin, finish leaves right away."

3.75,"Woody up front, with vanilla and raisin following. There's rye spice on the back-end, but you have to be patient; an interesting, enjoyable rye."

3.75,"It’s time for another deviation from scotch whisky.  This sample comes from my NJ connection, Mr @PBMichiganWolverine.  Whip Saw Rye is, obviously, a rye whiskey from a blending and bottling company called The Splinter Group.  This particular whiskey is comprised of 76% rye, 21% corn and 3% toasted barley.  It’s then finished for an unspecified amount of time in Pinot Noir and ex-Cabernet Sauvignon wine casks from Napa Valley and bottled at 45% ABV.

It’s a wonderful, dark mahogany in color and makes some of the slowest-forming, fat legs and tiny droplets in the tasting glass.  It’s also ridiculously oily and thick appearing.  The nose reeks of cherries and wine grapes that have been dusted in Christmas spices- like nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper.  There’s a faint bell pepper bite as well.  Toffee and charred oak reveal themselves if you wait them out.  It’s very lively and tempting.

The palate comes out of the gates as a sweet syrup.  Cherry juice, grapes and light dill.  The spices also warm the tongue while the syrupy-ness coats every corner of the mouth.  It’s rich and inviting, but also biting and spicy- it’s the best of both worlds commingling together.  The longer you hold it in place the hotter it gets and the spices begin to cut through the syrupy aspect and that’s a welcome sensation.  The finish is the most lackluster part of the dram as it came across as short to medium in duration and even the warmth and spices fade rather quickly.  All the reason to go in again, I suppose, but I only had a couple of ounces to work with.

In the end, this is another example of a fine, balanced rye whiskey.  I’m still on the fence when it comes to rye, so I’m not sure if I’d ever finish a full bottle if I bought and opened one.  But, if rye is your jam, then I highly recommend this one.  I think the availability is widespread and the price point is reasonable.  Seek it out and try it for yourself.  3.75-4 stars, which may be a little low just because I’m not a huge rye fan- your mileage may vary.  Cheers, my friends."

4.25,"When I got my latest batch of samples from @PBMichiganWolverine and saw this rye mixed in I was expecting the worst. I’m not a rye fan to begin with and with a name like Whip Saw I had the feeling it was going to be rough, hot and fit for cleaning out my drains. Let’s see what’s really going on here, shall we?  This is a blend of different undisclosed whiskies aged up to 7 years, then finished in wine barrels that held Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon (I’m a sucker for a good wine finish so maybe this won’t be that bad after all). Bottled at 45% ABV and I have no info on chill filtration or colorant, but the color is a beautiful burnt orange like autumn leaves. The mash bill is 76% rye, 21% corn and 3% malted barley. 

The nose is all wine. Dry Cabernet and very fruity...intriguing. Minty rye, red grapes, low sugar grape jelly and prunes. Almonds, cherries and marzipan. Sweet and tart raspberries and blackberries. A bit of a medicinal/doctors office note, and believe it or not, children’s Amoxicillin (you know, the pink antibiotic that tastes like gum). Caramel, toffee, vanilla, incredibly rich and savory after it sits a while. 
Water tones down the wine notes a bit and brings out more of the rye spice and some apples. Very creamy after sitting with water. 

The palate begins with distinct wine notes up front with rye spice right behind it. Light mint, tart berries and apples. Sweet grapes, cherries, marzipan and almonds. Caramel apples, vanilla, wine soaked oak, more rye, cloves and nutmeg. 
Water has the same effect as with the nose. 

A light to medium bodied mouthfeel that is dry and mouthwatering at the same time. 
The finish is long, very long. So long I was still tasting it hours later. Red wine, sweet and tart raspberries, dry. 

To say that I was pleasantly surprised is a gross understatement. This is good, great even. Best rye I’ve ever had (again I’m a sucker for a good wine finish). Wonderfully pronounced wine notes, smooth with almost no alcohol feel to it. Not much here to not like except maybe the finish could have been a bit sweeter and it could have used more depth overall. All in all this is a fantastic rye. For only $50 it’s a great value as well. 4.25 and highly recommended if you are a red wine drinker. 
Cheers"

5.0,"Great stuff. Sweet and spicy with notes of cloves, pepper, cinnamon, corn, toffee, prunes, raisins, blackberries, and a little chocolate. Big thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for including the sample with my Tapatio Excelencia purchase from him."
4.25,"Hat tip to @PBMichiganWolverine for the great recommendation. I had been toying with pulling the trigger on this and after reading his review this afternoon I decided this would be my new addition to the cabinet! Let's just say I was not dissapionted!
On the pallette I get an explosion of apples both red and green (think baked not raw) with cinnamon in he background. On the mid palatte you get a lovely raisin note that leads to the long gingerbread and wine oak driven finish. Complex dram that is a delight to sip! For $42.99 I cannot ask for much more! This is not one for the Rye purist but for the Rye adventurist! Best of the splinter group whiskeys! Cheers all!"
4.25,"It’s Friday...which means one thing.  Actually a few things, but only one thing I look forward to.  A nice dram to cap off a week.  Finally opened up this unique rye.  I took a wee sip, will take a much bigger dram this evening of course.  This rye isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoy rye and you love full bodied low tannic reds, this has your name all over it.  I guess initially I anticipated something like High West Midwinter, but easily accessible and reasonably priced.  It’s no where close to Midwinter.  Sure both are finished in wine, but they’re as different as they can be.  Whereas Midwinter evokes Christmas, this reminded me of visiting a Napa merlot winery.  You get the spicy rye upfront, with surprisingly tempered heat, but the finish is where the red wine kicks in.  In my opinion, it balances out the spice and makes the heat smoother.  Red wine finishing for rye is always risky.  Both are strong in their own right, and either you’ll get a tug of war mess, or it’ll be a nice partnership.  It’s good to see both play well here, neither calling for attention over the other.  It’s a unique rye, and at $50, worth it."

4.5,"Nose: Vanilla and simple syrup - almost like a good cake frosting.  Orange blossom.  Faint hint of oak.  Cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg.  Slightest black pepper.  Lovely stuff.

Palate: Vanilla, orange blossom, simple syrup.  Cake frosting comes to mind again.  Clove, honey, nutmeg.  I avoid the word as much as possible, but this stuff is smooth.  Tannin, black pepper, white pepper.   Oak with the slightest barrel bitter note.  The faintest dill/licorice/anise note shows up at the very end.  Medium-long finish that hits those vanilla, orange blossom, and simple syrup notes.

Other notes: I'm partial to the entire Splinter Group line - Straight Edge, Slaughter House, and Whip Saw (this whiskey).  Straight Edge (the bourbon) was the first bottle i ever picked up on a whim specifically because I had no idea what it was and what it would be like and it payed off big time.  Also shows that sourced whiskey that's then finished (a la Angel's Envy) can be excellent.  It might not be everybody's cup of tea, but I love it."
4.5,"Rye with a Pinot finish? Sign me up! It has the typical sweetness but the spiciness but its somewhat subdued thanks to the added berry aromas. A great finish to this collection, I like this more than the Whistlepig Old World! 94"

3.25,"Taste:  1.5 oz neat in Glen Cairn and then 2 drops.

Nose (3.0):  There is a menthol that hits me, almost like a eucalyptas cough drop which is a bit off putting.  I get rye, dill, and green fruit.  Not my favorite nose.

Taste (3.5) :  I get a very raw rye taste, a bit of dill, some chocolate, and tart berries.  That menthol lessens its grip, but is still there and is my major complaint.  Not sure if it is more menthol now or like chewing rye seeds.  More maneageable on the palate then when it overwhelmed my nose a bit.  My first sip affirms that this is to be experienced more as a rye ""experiment"" than a conventional rye whiskey.  I knew it going in, no doubts now.  The mouthfeel is thicker and coating.  It is a full, rich spirit.

Finish (3.0):  Longer and drier.  I get a fresh young wood type flavor that isn't particularly bad but it is not delicious either.  The wine barrel finishing is definately present here and I think that is what might save the finish from being a disaster.  

Overall: I was hoping for something like MWND, but got something closer to Catoctin Creek (which I did not enjoy).  There is interesting notes in here, and the wine idea is interesting, but to me the rye is too young.  My mind is always open to new finishing as although I tend to like traditional well crafted, aged bourbons and ryes I have really enjoyed some of the finished ones (WT Revival, MWND, Rieger'sto name a few).  To me this one just isn't good enough executed rye.  When it is as high a rye in the mash as this, it has to be aged well.  This just isn't that."
3.0,Smells very interesting. Like a musty old wine cellar. Taste is botanical. Medicinal. Burnt sugar. Raisin. Wine barrel. This is too far of a departure from traditional rye whiskey for my liking.
