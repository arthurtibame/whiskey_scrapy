4.0,"Not really your every day Whisky, but I wanted to see what Compass Box is able to do ""at their worst"". If this is their worst, hell, I need to try some other stuff. On the nose, you get - big surprise - bitter orange notes, together with cloves and some pepper. The taste starts rather bitter too, then the orange and a bit of honey kick in. Not very sweet, that surprised me. Unlike most orange flavored liquor you still get a taste of the single malt in there. Barley notes, vanilla. Typical highland. Granted, all a bit muted behind the orange, but it is there. Finish is spicy, orange, but rather short. Would I use this as every day dram? No. But it's an alternative to stuff like Cointreau and Grand Manier, when the orangy bug bites me again. Plus, not that expensive."
null,first scotch. Just trying to figure out what I like. Has a faint citrus scent and taste.
4.0,I enjoyed it. It's meant to taste like orange and it does that well. Easy drinking and a different taste. Not an everyday whiskey though.

3.25,"Well this is bizarre. This clearly is not whisky, its quite the experience but, not necessarily a good one. 

Bottled at 40%abv, the bottle is beautiful but it says that orange is infused to the whisky. Odd. 

On the nose is interesting but way to powerful to be enjoyable. Orange, Lemon, Salt, cheap taxi Air freshener,  Superbly citric. It reminds me exactly of a ""tang"" juice formula (a powder that mixed with water that gives you something like an orange juice). Vitamin C pills. 

On the palate is an acid bomb. Lemon lime and all acid citric flavors. Orange peel. Off putting. 

Aftertaste is slightly salty. 

Overall it is something i would not buy nor drink, but i think someone might like it, maybe for mixing it. 67/100"

4.0,My word there are some strong haters on this....yes the orange is heavy..it's on the label for God's sake. The taste is huge orange bitter at first but it passes almost instantly. Giving way to the lovely clove. This is not meant to be anything other than what it is a niche product not intended for whole consumption. You need take this almost as an aperitif.  Don't let some one tell you what to drink try it an see if you like it. I do but there in again I LOVE rye whisky and I love the spice in this......matter of fact I'm going to pour myself a little right now.

3.0,It's a different whiskey but it's ok for once in a while to change it up.
2.0,"Neat: Go find a nice ripe, firm, bright colored orange and (without peeling it) take a big ol' bite, as if 'twere an apple. 

Over Ice: practically disappears into the ether of boringness. If this were any lighter it would be a gas.

Bottom line: While not revolting, it's simply not a scotch whisky experience. Even my wife enjoys it (Irrefutable proof).

P.S. props to the indomitable Pranay for the bottle!"
1.0,"Compass Box Orangerie, a blended scotch whiskey from Compass Box blenders. Price: $40.00. Sampled 6/10/16 with 1/2 teaspoon of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.  Aroma - HEAVY orange, vanilla cream, butter and cake frosting. Taste - Orange liqueur and allspice. Finishes with a quickly fading burn and medium-length lingering flavor. Final score: 1/ 5. This to me is not whiskey. The sweet orange is so overpowering in this that the whiskey flavors take a back seat and come across more like cognac. Tastes more like a high quality orange liqueur with cognac mixed in, AKA Grand Mariner. I have literally moved this from my whiskey cabinet to the bar to be used in drinks that call for Grand Mariner, I kid you not. Save your money here, I know Compass Box typically does no wrong and this seems so interesting but I assure you if you're looking for a whiskey experience, you will be sorely disappointed."
2.0,"I love whisky.  I love oranges.  What if they have a whisky that taste like subtle oranges??!!?!   Yeah, sign me up, and here's my $50.  Not so fast hombre.  I love popcorn and I love pizza.  But popcorn on pizza may not be the ideal marriage.  I really admire John Glaser and Compass Box for their experiments, and most are amazing.  This one...not so.  The nose is like sitting in an orange juice factory.  Can't hate that.  I can smell this for breakfast.  (Now if Compass Box can work on whisky that taste like eggs and bacon, here's another $50!!).  Palette really is like biting into an orange tictac.  Sweet, orange-y.  What did I expect?  And finish---fast and....guess what?  Orange-y!!!  Really unique.  Worthwhile to,try, but not sure it's a must buy situation, unless you really (and I mean REALLY ) love oranges.  Ironically, right after I purchased this, I suddenly recalled I had a dram of Amrut Naarangie (which means Oranges in Hindi) at Heathrow.  I think that was much better, more subtle.  Less like you took a shower with oranges and more like you took a whiff of oranges while having a drink. Meanwhile Mr. Glaser...if you can conjure up that eggs and bacon whisky..."
