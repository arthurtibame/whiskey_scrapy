5.0,"Wonderful whisky. Absolutely enjoyable. It is a summary of what dalmore preaches. Matured entirely in first fill matusalem sherry casks, it gives you a great time on the nose and in the palate. As always, dalmore means sweetness and this cant be more sweet. Best part, it costs $106. It is the most expensive bottle of the ""fortune meritas"" collection which was originally intended for travel retail. (The other 3 are: Valour, Regalis and Luceo).

Bottled at 43%abv, beautiful mahogany color. 

On the nose it was marvelous. From the first second it felt special. It transported me to the spice market in Turkey. 

Beautiful toffee, Old dehydrated oranges, 
Candied fruits, Figs syrup so incredible!
Orange thick marmalade, Dehydrated dates. Just perfect.

On the palate it is so enjoyable. Amazing milk chocolate, Herbal spiciness that balances so well. Butterscotch. Delicious
Cocoa. Molasses. Dark rum. Cognac. Slight nuttiness. 

Aftertaste is a little spicy but so well balanced, maybe clove or ginger. A slight note of burnt oak. 

Overall this wonderful dram is totally recommended. I truly believe you can have this in your bar and always take a sip of it. 100 over 100, this is what whisky should be, a truly enjoyable experience. Not complex, just delicious. Slainte!"
