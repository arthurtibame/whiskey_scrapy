2.0,"Decent if unremarkable. Okay as a mixer for a party, but there are plenty of better choices in that price range."

1.0,"I bought this because it was in a gift box with four samples of their flavored bourbons.  The flavored bourbons were interesting but tasted nothing like bourbon.  This wasn't even as good as the flavored varieties, no depth or flavor.  I won't buy again."

2.0,Weak. They should've made it uncut to give it that oumfff!!
1.0,"Reminds me of a bourbon-flavor-infused vodka, as opposed to a true bourbon.  Aging specifics are hard to find, and most likely for good reason. I can only imagine a few years of maturity incorporated into this bottle.  Contrary to other reviewers, even for the cheap(er) price point, this still wouldn't make the cut. There are a number of better bottles out there for similar, or lower cost."

2.0,"Love the labels but the whiskey is not great. Missing any impact in the flavor, it's very boring, and it can't even stand up to Coke that well. Maybe the aged stuff is a little better, buy I'll probably just stick to the flavored versions if I buy this brand."
2.5,"On the nose, pretty non-descript. On the tongue, a dash of whiskey and alcohol burn. Decent for a cheap bottle of whiskey but I wouldn’t buy it again.  Commercial moonshine or white lightning is better than this."
2.0,Bought this because of the label. Knew nothing about it. My tasting notes suck. Tastes oak-y and it burns
2.25,Nothing to write home about
1.5,"I used to think this was pretty good before I started trying more bourbons like Buffalo Trace, Knob Creek, Elijah Craig.. Etc., For the money, Ezra Brooks Black is far better.
Bird Dog has a front-forward, vanillaish nose and front-end that kind of tapers down to the taste of Texas lake -kind of a like earthy lake water. dirty. I've noticed a lot of the cheaper bourbons wear on me this way. Not anything I'd buy again."
1.5,"Extremely light color, very little age, and tastes heavily of water and smoke. Without telling me, I'd guess this is one of those legal grocery store 40 proof bourbons. Finishes actually decently, with rye spice lingering past the lower flavor profiles. I suppose it is and does taste like bourbon, but what you would buy if you wanted something different from Jim Beam but still with the lack of flavor."

2.0,"Color: So comparing this Kentucky bourbon to it’s 10 year old brother, it’s obviously and noticeably lighter. The color is an old gold in my Glencairn glass and the legs are very thin and watery.

Nose: The nose possesses lemon zest and orange notes, caramel, barn hay, and a hint of car exhaust.

Taste: The taste is pretty basic. Nothing worthy of writing home about. A little oaky tannins, some leftover Halloween caramels that nobody wanted, with some green grapes and grapefruit as well.

Finish: The finish is dry with an almost dry white wine aftertaste. Leaving also an almost “sparkly” mouthfeel.

Thoughts: This bourbon is decent. I'm glad I tried it; It won't be a favorite of mine or anything, but if you look at the brand as a whole, it kinda makes sense their bourbon won't stand out on its own because they are a brand that specializes in flavored whiskeys. Now for the most part that's not my thing, but if it's yours, these are your people! I'm afraid though Bird Dog’s entry bourbon though isn't really my thing. Sorry guys!"
