3.5,"Nose is some orange and toffee, with some darker fruits behind. Fairly floral as well.

Taste is some pear and honey, creme brulee up front and the Sherry at the end.  Hints of honey and vanilla on the finish."
2.5,"2019 Advent smells of almonds vanilla, tastes honey butter apple finishes pepper with nutmeg"
4.0,Well balanced honey and toffee with a touch of earthiness.  Very nice.
3.0,Tasting Batch 3  almost smoky nose due to high alcohol content. With 2 drops water brings out banana caramel. Rich and creamy on the tongue with a bit of a sharp finish. Could use even more water.
4.0,A sweet and robust malt that is easy on the palate. No peatiness at all. A good malt for someone who is not into peat but wants something more interesting.
