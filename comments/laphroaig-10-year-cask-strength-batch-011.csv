4.5,"The peat greets the nose, although not as pungent and acrid as one might expect. There is a deep marine scent of iodine and salt, which permeates the nose overcoming the blanket of ash, on whose waves almonds, roasted marshmellows, vanilla, plums, ripe peach and lemon zest are carried. Background medicinal note.
The used liquid ashtray slips and burns in the mouth (you get all of its alcohol strength), creating a permanent layer that remains between one sip and the other, on which the strongly coastal scents flow accompanied by pepper, licorice, cloves, marzipan... the sweetness is almost annihilated by the ash and maritime power of the whisky, which brings out the spices and the macilent and sulphurous nature of the peat, naked and contemptuous. Here there is no great complexity, stratification, aromas that intertwine, it is a linear and cynical drink, almost primordial, stunning.
Very long finish, of carbonized algae mixed in salted water, licorice, lemon.
An incisive, decisive, uncompromising taste that enhances the island and oceanic spirit of the whisky creating an intense, brutal, even difficult, but satisfying experience. A braggart whisky.
If you love peat in its most organic and infernal nature, this whisky is for you."

4.75,"Fantastic stuff. Deeper and richer than the regular 10 year. Lots of salted and smoked meats on the nose and palate, of course with a fair serving of peat and a smooth finish. Strong stuff, but I’m really enjoying it neat. Adding a little water is also a great option; it really opens up notes of seaweed on the nose and a buttery sweetness on the palate."
