2.25,"If you've ever wondered what White Label Beam would taste like 6 proof points higher and without the chill filtering...Wish Granted. I was unimpressed. Thin and hot with little complexity. The Beam peanut funk is front and center. Ice or a splash does help and it does sport a little more oak than the standard White Label. It also runs the same price as the White Label, so if you must buy entry level Beam, this would be the one."

2.75,"On the plus side, it *is* at least better than the standard Beam (which has always reminded me of corn and peanuts soaked in grain alcohol). But I don't want to oversell it, either. It's . . . not great. Nose is heavily mineral and heavy on the paint thinner fumes. A hint of citrus, some slight vanilla and oaky sweetness. Taste is actually nicely oily if still a bit thin (thanks no-chill-filtering), with vanilla, citrus, and some light, sweet wood char and peanuts. A bit hot with a faint touch of nail polish remover--but then the finish is there (nuts, fumes, burnt lemon)-and-gone, so it's (almost) hardly a weakness. Better than standard Beam White Label? One hundred per cent! Worth the investment in a world where Beam Rye, Beam Distiller's Cut, and Beam Bottled-in-Bond are all within $5-10 in price? Not a chance. (And that's saying nothing of Evan Williams Black Label, which is pretty much the platonic cheap bourbon and available for $5 *less* locally.)"

3.0,I tried a couple pours in my Norlan glass. I was surprised by the nose. Not too bad really. Vanilla and corn are very present followed by nuttiness. No complexity but it hits those notes fairly well. The pallet follows suit with light sweetness and nuttiness. Nothing complex. It's thin but has a finish that belies the $9.99 I paid for it. At retail there's better options but for ten bucks it's a solid winner in my book. Simple and straight forward bourbon.

2.5,"Jim Beam Repeal Batch is the distiller’s throwback to 1930’s prohibition era bourbon, and the “vintage” old school style label reflects its ambitions.  Despite the bottle being only $16, Repeal Batch is a non chill filtered bourbon, a definite rarity in this price class.  Does the nostalgia and “limited edition” branding equal higher quality here or a clever marketing spin?  Let’s find out!

Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn, no water added.  On the nose, you get the very familiar Beam bourbon profile, albeit pretty weak, and nothing more.  It’s straight light vanilla buttercream sitting on top of semi sweet dusty cornmeal and lots of grain alcohol.  I assume like standard Beam white, this is a fairly young bourbon because there is no real oaky presence or richness and depth here, rather disappointing.  

On the palate, you first notice the more oily character thanks to the NCF process, and while nice, the feel is still rather thin owing to the relatively low ABV I’m sure.  By comparison, JB Distillers Cut at 50% ABV, also a NCF expression, is far richer, even more oily, and coats the mouth in a nice thickness.  As for flavors, the Repeal Batch is a straight ahead bourbon profile of light vanilla, hints of citrus zest, and corn grain alcohol. It’s not overly sweet, and more tart actually.  There is little to no spice or burn to wake the palate, and oak flavors are almost absent, which again I presume is due to underaged product.  Again, compared to Distiller’s Cut, the RB is just plain weak and uninspired.  DC has tons of spiciness, nice burn, far richer more complex flavors, and enhanced oakiness.  

The finish for RB is also rather disappointing.  It’s very very short, lacks anything interesting.  You get fading vanilla caramel tart and faint hints at toasted wood and that's about it.   I really think this bourbon suffers from being just too young to be interesting.  Take JB White, and NCF it and bingo, you get this “limited edition.”   

Overall, for $16 it’s certainly not the worst you could do, but it’s far from the best too.  Despite being a limited run product, there is absolutely nothing memorable, other than the label on the bottle, that stands out about this pour.  In all honesty I question why it even exists in the Beam portfolio, and it should be “Repealed” if you ask me!   If you want to experience a really good NCF bourbon for just a few $ more, do yourself a huge favor and pick up the JB Distiller’s Cut instead!  It’s what Beam should taste like, without saying Knob Creek on the bottle!  If you absolutely must stick to the near $15/bottle limit, I’d pick Evan Williams 1783 by far.  While 1783 is a quirky flavor profile, at least it offers a good bit of varied flavors and is super smooth for the same money.  Heck even EW Black offers stronger bourbon flavor of vanilla and caramel than this Beam expression.  Bottom line, the NCF and fancy throwback label just aren’t reason enough to justify another purchase of this bourbon.  I vote to repeal this batch of Repeal Batch, but long live Distiller's Cut!  Cheers!"

3.0,"Tonight I am in the mood for some no nonesense, uncomplicated, and easy to sip on Bourbon. I've had this one collecting dust for a while (bought it when it was on sale for $13.99 at my local supermarket), but when my ""worst"" open bottle is EH Taylor (damn fine juice) then maybe it's time crack this one open.
For background, this is basically Jim Beam White Label that has NOT gone thru charcoal filtration and is bottled at 86 proof versus 80 proof. No preferential barrel selection or age on it. It's the same exact 4-6 yr old stock as the white label. 
On to the tasting! On the pallette it soft and smooth with a big vanilla, toffee and peanut driven entry. Classic Beam! Mid pallette features some oak and barrel char with clove and honey. The finish is a solid meduim length that is oak, vanilla driven and some coffee notes appear as it fades. 
All in all a lovely drop for $14!
It richer, more viscous and just plain more satisfying than the white label. I personally prefer it to all the other standard Beam expressions (Distillers is not available in my market). I would even go as far as to say that I prefer this to the Jim Beam Single Barrel. 
Now if I was rating this purely on value, it's a solid 4-4.5. However, when we look as the full picture I think a 3/5 is fair. Any Beam fan should have a bottle on hand. This and OGD 114 are the two value Beams to seek out (again I have not had the chance to taste Distillers Cut). 
As a side note, this is where I think American Whiskey excels when compared to it's peers. For a sub $20 price point, you can find a really solid bottle. I have yet to experience than same in Irish, Scottish, Canadian or Japanese Whiskey. Once you go north of $50 then it's game on. However at the sub $50 price point I still think the American Whiskeys are King. Cheers All!"
1.5,"Meh, it’s one that I wish I had saved my money, even at 15 bucks.  I don’t care for regular Beam so not sure why I thought this would be different.  It’s has a sour funk like regular Beam and I find a little sweetness on the mid palate that I cannot define.  Finish is peppery and alcohol burn much more than it’s proof would suggest.  Will not buy again and will use as a mixer or for cooking."
3.5,"At first I thought the name & label were just a marketing scheme, but that’s not the case. It’s solid so I stocked up on a bunch of bottles since I found it for $9.99 & I’m not sure if it’s truly a limited release."

3.25,"I remember when a far less well endowed friend of mine and I discovered that Coors Light and Keystone Light were brewed by the same company. The joke became: “Keystone Light. The beer for those for whom Coors Light needs to be turned down a scooch.” I am currently tasting Jim Beam Repeal Batch, with the OG Beam in my other glass for comparison.

From the nose, there’s no question to me that this is Jim Beam. I get the yeast, a bit of banana. But in comparison to the OG, nonexistent.

Body delivers on the nose. Also oak, bit of leather. When I went back to the OG, it almost knocked my teeth out. Same favor profile, but you really can’t understand how muted this body is until trying it in tandem. Wow.

I’m on record saying that Jim Beam’s finish is almost nonexistent. Again, the repeal batch has found a way to turn nonexistence down a scooch. By comparison, OG tastes spicy and has a long finish. On this repeal batch I really couldn’t find the transition. It’s all body, and then gone.

I think I prefer this slightly, because I’m not a huge fan of the flavor profile of Jim Beam. Repeal batch is a muted version, start to finish. Nothing new to get excited about, but not terrible."

3.5,"BACKGROUND:  Jim Beam Repeal Batch is a limited edition expression that is meant to take you back to the same era, and it officially celebrates the 85th anniversary of the repeal of Prohibition on December 5, 1933

It is interesting to note that even though the Beam family had been deeply entrenched in bourbon distilling since the 18th Century, 1933 was also the year that the company we know today was officially branded as “Jim Beam.”  Prior to being named for proprietor James Beauregard Beam, the company had been known as “Old Tub” since around 1864.

According to the the official announcement about the limited edition Repeal Batch offering, seventh-generation Master Distiller Fred Noe said, “For the 85th anniversary of Repeal Day, we wanted to release a bourbon inspired by our heritage and dedicated to the hard work my great-grandfather (Jim Beam) put into rebuilding our family business after Prohibition,.  Jim Beam Repeal Batch pays tribute to all the generations of Beams that came before me.”

Unlike most bourbons, Repeal Batch is non-chill filtered - which allows some of the fats and acids that affect flavor to remain intact - and it is supposed to have a fuller mouthfeel and bolder char and oak palate than regular Jim Beam.

NOSE: The nose offers the unmistakable scent of buttered popcorn along with oak and the nutty funkiness (funk being good, not bad, in this case) that seems to be a trademark of most Beam products.

PALATE: The Repeal Batch palate is super nutty but also contains sweet cornbread goodness along with oak and a bit of cherry cough syrup flavor that is present in some bourbons.

FINISH: The long finish consists almost entirely of oak and a definite mint flavor that develops on the back of the tongue.  It drinks a bit hot for an 86 proof and even offers a slight Kentucky hug in the chest.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: I am a fan of Jim Beam’s more limited offerings, such as Double Oak, Distiller’s Cut, and Bonded, and their higher end expressions, which include Knob Creek and Booker’s.  Repeal Batch falls nicely into that niche of Beam products that meet my liking and flavor profile.

At just 17.99 a bottle, Jim Beam Repeal Batch is a worthy daily sipper that can stand alone in a Glencairn while also being inexpensive enough to mix, if necessary. 

I give Jim Beam Repeal batch three-and-a-half stars out of five."

3.75,"Picked up a variety of Jim Beam products on sale at klwines and the first one up for review is the Jim Beam Repeal Batch. The concept behind the Repeal Batch is to mimic the bourbon that was being produced in the 30s when prohibition was repealed. It is non-chillfiltered and bottled at 43% ABV. Picked this bottle up on sale for $9.99, which is cheap enough that it's hard to say no to any bottle at that price. Fortunately, I think this one was well worth the price, though not particulary exciting. More thoughts and rating below: ⠀
⠀
🥃 Jim Beam Repeal Batch - 43% ABV
⠀
Nose: Peanut butter. Charred oak and corny sweetness. A little peppery and warm, but no unpleasant smells. Tiny bit of sweet cinammon. Really a nice nose and already better than standard Jim Beam white label.
⠀
Taste: Boozy corn, barrel char, and heat. Some baking spices. Sweet and a little sour. Plenty of heat for the proof. This is where the inexpensive price tag shows. It feels a bit light and lacking in flavor.
⠀
The mouthfeel seems slightly more oily than other inexpensive Beams, but is still pretty light. I'm guessing it's due to being non-chill filtered, but I honestly didn't realize that other standard Beam products were filtered.
⠀
This a nice bourbon for the price. Simple drinking, not too much thinking. The nose is pretty awesome but the taste isn't worth writing too much about.
