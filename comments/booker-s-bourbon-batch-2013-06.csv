3.0,"Ok, let me first tell you how i did not know it was 63% abv. I drank it neat and got wasted very quickly. Lol

63%abv tawny color.

On the nose: Cigar smoke, Brown grass Burning like a forest fire. Old rotten prunes.

On the palate: Hot Chilli: Oaky powerful.
Prunes and a bourbon influence appears when taking a small sip.

Finish is ashy and sulfuric. Very long.

Overall, i give this unpleasant drink a 60 over 100, understanding that someone else might love it, but not me."
3.5,Honey and cinnamon.
