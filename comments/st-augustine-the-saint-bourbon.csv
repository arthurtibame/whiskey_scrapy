Very smooth for its proof"
4.5,Very well done. Aged in barrels that made their Old Fashioned Mix this is one of the finest bourbons I’ve ever had. Only 300 bottles made. I’m going to be sad when this is gone.

4.5,"This is a really good bourbon. The distillery is fairly new to the game but man, what a great turnout on this Saint. A limited run in the fall of 2019 at 400 bottles, it's worth the buy. Can't wait for the next run. Great balance of sweet and spice. Smoother than expected."
