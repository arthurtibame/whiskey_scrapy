2.5,"Haevy peaty ilse of islay taste, not bad but a bit too strongly medicinal"
3.0,"Very pale in colour, almost as white wine. Some lemon and honey on the nose with smoke and salt. Slightly medicinal on palate but a very thin mouth feel. Short finish. Pleasant and drinkable, the nose better than the palate. I wouldn’t buy a bottle."
