5.0,"By far the most exclusive and unique whisky I own. After trying it, my spouse wasn’t even mad at how expensive it was. Very approachable and round, would be a general crowd pleaser but I won’t be sharing it too often. 

Nose - light and sweet, melted chocolate, almonds and roasted nuts, a bit of fresh berries and a hint of scotch muskiness
Taste - sweet fruit forward, with some soft almond flavors, a bit of milk chocolate, and some light bitterness
Finish - the oily sweetness lingers followed by a bit of spice and a comforting burn"
