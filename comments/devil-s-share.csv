2.0,For 250 dollars I was expecting a lot more from this whiskey. I was just disappointed.

2.0,Harsh start with an even rougher finish.
3.0,"It’s decent enough for a four year bourbon, but definitely not worth the price tag. I’m still surprised that after a number of years the cost for this bottle has only gone up. Money is better spent on bottles that are better for half the price. 

Opened 2/13
Finished 9/19"
null,Not my fav.. harsh bite imo. I've bought better bourbons for less.

3.0,"An uneven profile, a little hot on the tongue, a harsh finish. Definitely over priced. Especially compared to its single malt sibling, which was superb, though not worth the $250 price by any means."
