4.0,"Tasted in a glencairn glass. Sweet initial undertones. Light mouth feel. A bit watery with a harsh burn up front and down the throat. Notes of toasted oak, caramel, and honey. A single cube lightens the burn but kills the flavor too. Drink it neat, enjoy the hug. For the price, you can’t beat this whiskey."
2.75,For under $13 this is pretty dang good. Seems like a very well balanced bourbon for mixers etc.... I mean it’s hard to argue

4.5,"If you can try it, but it. For the money, it is great. Took it overseas to Germany and it was also very well liked."
5.0,For price point this is definitely the best whiskey on the market. Great for mixing
3.25,"Nose... Simple caramel and roasted corn. Sweet and oat heavy....

Appearance... A light to medium Amber...

Taste... Cereal dominant, almost like a dry bowl of Cheerios. The flavor is corn influenced, with grass and earthy tones.

Overall... At the price point it makes more than sense. In my humble, almost conspiracy type of opinion, they (Binnys) have taken a very nice barrel of bourbon, and consumed themselves what they seemed reasonable and have then watered down the rest to bottle it as is. Is this bad? No, not at all, better than most bottom shelf. Holds it's own neat and when I consider that I paid $13 it's really a shelf taker."
4.0,Nice vanilla notes and sweetness. Great value for the price!
