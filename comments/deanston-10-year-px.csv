4.25,"This is my first experience with Deanston and I have to say I am quite enjoying it. This was an North America exclusive release that was fairly limited and released about 5 yrs ago. 

It's aged for 8 yrs in Ex-Bourbon Casks with 2 yrs finishing in PX butts. It's natural color and bottled at cask strength a hefty 57.1% ABV. It's a lightly Peated Single Malt. 

 On the palette it enters rich and oily. Big vanilla, toffee and chocolate covered cherries. Baking spices, orange marmalade and red fruits on the mid palette. Finish is long and the PX influence is dominant with a spice on the tongue. 

All in all it's a lovely malt that drinks much older than it's 10yr age statement. A definite crowd pleaser. 

Cheers All!"
