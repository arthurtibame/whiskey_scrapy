4.25,"Hands down the best Wemyss i have ever had, this is a very nice whisky that is complex enough and well crafted for more experienced palates. 

Bottled at 46%abv.

On the nose, a very complex and well crafted dram. Tropical fruits. White wine. Peat, cut grass. Chocolate fudge, pineapple and coconut. Nice.

On the palate, it has a lot of character. Peaty / earthy. Smoke. Dry grass, dry sweetness. Mostly a mild peat. 

Aftertaste, is ashy with a short cigarrette note. Very similar to ardmore. 

Overall this is a nice dram. The price tag gives it another point. 87 over 100."

2.75,"chutná divně. jako levné blended. žádný kouř, žádná svěžest. temná, ale nudná. kvalitní, ale moje chuť to není."
4.0,"Delightfully smokey and smooth. Oily with Warm lingering peat smoke, a pleasing spice hangs on the tongue but doesn’t overwhelm. Iodine and medicinal notes are apparent. If you like islay scotches, this is a nice value buy under $40. Limited edition...stock up"

4.0,The smoky taste stays on your palate long and has a slight burn - The best blended scotch I have found if you like your scotch Peat & Smoky!
