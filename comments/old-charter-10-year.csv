4.25,"Nose- Green apple and caramel
Body- There is a hint of that musty walnut sweetness I get in Blanton’s. However this has more mouth coating sweetness like sweet tea made with agave syrup. 
Finish-The syrupy sweetness continues into fresh cut grass. And then the green apple comes up at the end. 

I like this a lot. I was fortunate to find it at the Silver Dollar in Louisville. Unfortunately, it is no longer in production. I like the Silver Dollar a lot. The wait staff was helpful and friendly without being pretentious, a rare quality in a well respected bourbon bar."
