3.5,"This is marked 40% ABV by Distiller, but my bottle is marked 43%.

Rich aromas of malt, honey, vanilla, and raisins on the nose. Palate is a little oily with more raisins, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Finish is spiced oak.

This Scotch is too sweet for me to have a second glass, and frankly not as good as the Macallan 12. The flavor isn't bad, but I think there are better options available in this price range."

The entry is surprisingly full and balanced, with a viscous, even oily, mouthfeel.  The oak balances out the sweetness and tannins.  Unfortunately, there is no complexity, and the oakiness notes suggest that the butts may not be first use.

By my estimation, this is the best of the Balvenie lineup, with the exception of the 21 Portwood, which is sad, and disappointing."

3.5,This is a very nice sweet Scotch with the strong sherry notes of raisins and even bananas with a nutty aftertaste. Not the best in the amazing group of 12 year Speysides but holds its own and makes for one of my favorite after meal sippers.

3.5,Nice aroma. Clean. Expected more peat
3.75,"A sample bottle picked up in a sampler pack as I'm curious about Balvenie.

Nose: Vanilla and a ton of red fruit and quite a bit of sherry cask funk.  Pretty basic sherry cask finished single malt nose with not a whole lot else sticking out.

Flavor: Much milder on the sherry finish than the nose suggests.  Vanilla, light sugars, dried dates and figs, dried cherry, a little bit of musty sherry funk.  Very pleasant.

Finish:  Medium short, some more sherry funk with quite a bit of oak and more spice than I'd expect from a single malt.

Overall I liked this quite a bit.  Maybe my favorite sherry finished whiskey to date."

3.75,"Appearance: Nice deep gold, good legs. 

Nose: Pretty powerful vanilla, something a little toasty but dominated by the vanilla, some soft fruit, maybe a little apricot. A touch of coconut too perhaps. 

Palate: A hell of a lot of vanilla, some nice fruity notes and a touch of honey. Quite a chewy finish, with a bit more alcohol on the swallow than I was expecting. There's a lingering nutty sweetness but the vanilla rules the roost here for me. 

Overall: Very nice Speyside, bit of a classic nowadays and rightly so. Very drinkable, nice and sweet. Vanilla is the over-riding character, bordering on being a little over the top for me personally, but the late fruity kick and the soft honey sweetness rounds it off nicely."

3.75,"My brother gifted me this bottle for Christmas, so I'm listing below the current NC ABC price. I believe Aaron Rodgers has said this is his favorite daily drinker scotch, and I can see why. It is eminently drinkable.

On the nose I get a lot of honey, light vanilla, and more oak than a typical 12Y malt. Although The Balvenie website says it is finished in Oloroso for 9 months, I do not get strong hints of fruit. Maybe pitted fruits like apricots, peaches, apples, etc., but not prominent. The honey and oak are the dominant flavors on the tongue, I still don't get much fruit-forward influence from the Oloroso casks. The tannic influence from the oak is very pronounced on the finish. It lingers and coats the mouth, it is very similar to a standard bourbon finish. 

Overall this is a very nice scotch but in my opinion overpriced. For one of the larger distilleries in Scotland I'm surprised this is more expensive than Macallan 12, and $15-30 more than a lot of well-known 12Y malts in the $40-60 range. I've seen Balvenie 12 at plenty of bars so I'd recommend trying it there before paying this much for a bottle. Thankfully mine was free!"

3.5,"Nothing extraordinary but not bad at all. 

On the nose you will first find a honey note that will quickly fade into a medicinal plant aroma will also fade into a long lasting never ending plum note with and almond there somewhere. It sounds amazing but it really doesnt penetrate your nose, it is just there if you nose it hard enough.

On the palate is not complex, is woody. Lots and lots of wood and oak, hot but gentle, medium bodied, almost sweet at first, with a medium finish also filled with wood and cinnamon.

It is so straightforward what you perceive from it that i got the notes at my first attempt and after writing them down i went to the official website and found just the same. I often do this to check if my nose and palate are getting the job done. 

It is not a bad whisky, but for a 12 year old, there are far superior whiskies out there. Wouldn't buy it again. If someone gave it to me as a present i will surely drink it all but i wouldn't buy it for myself"

4.0,Very smooth and sweet
4.0,"Aroma: Buttery, sherry, sweet. Fruitier than Glenrothes Sherry Cask Reserve. Fuji apples, barley malt, creme brûlée; toasted marshmallows. Elegant & round. 

Taste: thick body. Sweet, barley sugar arrival with toffee, fruit, dried fruit, golden raisins, ginger, and sherry on the palate.

Finish: medium length, toffee, barley sugar, sherry, oak.

Overall: great whisky for when you’re in the mood for an easy, sweet, opulent speysider."
4.25,Rich and full flavor. Can pick up on notes of honey and wood. I take a lot of pleasure in the aftertaste. Definitely will grab another at some point. This bottle will hold a special place in my heart being the first bottle of scotch I opened in my house.

3.75,"Nose: 4* Inviting, delicate, honey, ripe oranges, subtle sherry 

Body: 4* Balanced, mellow, watery, vanilla, walnuts, sherry sweetness, fruitiness

Finish: 3,75* Medium, slightly citric, bit of woodspice, ripe fruit 

Best neat. Very pleasant, great balance, quite inoffensive for it's age. Lacks a bit of body.

A true speyside classic and one of the first sherry-cask finished malts.
This was one of the first bottles of whisky i've bought when starting my journey last year, also one of the first to empty! As a beginner i'd say this whisky was much more approachable than other single malts. I would highly recommend this to anyone getting into single malts."

4.0,Nutty with grape and vanilla. Spice notes.
3.0,"The nose has dried dark fruits with some woody spiciness with some caramel and vanilla, but it's brash rather than smooth. The palate is more floral with some of that wet cardboard woodiness, but no mildew. There's a light hit of mint and then the fruits and spices come out. The red fruit flavor is mild and blends well with the floral butterscotch and hints of citrus. The spicy wood is clearly present and indicates the youth, but it blends nicely with with the floral and other sweet notes. It's more complex as Glenmorangie The Original but it's about as brash and it doesn't have the nice orange flavor. They're roughly comparable, though I think I'd favor the Balvenie 12 slightly."

The taste is sweet like honey and vainilla, with spice like a bit of nutmeg. With lasting taste that came from the double cask maturation which is very noticeable and pleasant. There are some traces of dried fruit as well. Very very enjoyable experience."

3.0,Интересный напиток. Стоит попробовать ещё раз
3.25,"Nose: Richly sweet. Chocolate and berries. Strong aroma of cherry. Slightly oaky.

Palate: Chocolate cherries. Subtle honey blending with other berry flavor as well. Some malt and spice. Sherry cask not overpowering but definitely present. Smooth as hell.

Finish: Medium-long. Honey and sherry flavor lingering longest. Sweetness of berries mixing nicely with a spicy finish.

Overall Thoughts: This was a nice one. I’ll admit that I’m not very fond of Sherry finishes because I feel they usually try a bit too hard to impress and it ends up being overpowering. This one isn’t too much and it’s actually quite sweet while having a richness to it. It’s pleasant while complex. A large purchase is a long way off but I’ll definitely consider it when I have some extra Scotch money."
