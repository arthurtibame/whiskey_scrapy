4.0,"Well my first add here. That's pretty cool. 

So distilled in 1985 so I had to get it and review it. 

Nose - I get light oak, apples, I get some butter scotch and a good bit of alcohol. Going to need water. Water, brings out some custard and baked bread and some honey. 

Taste - Oh man full body here. Sweet, some smoke, yeah some green apple, cork, oh yeah this got a lot of used oak barrels. Water gives me honey nut cheerios. Apples and pears, oh I'm almost getting the finish on an apple even. 


I'm pretty darn happy with this one. Complex and likely all ex bourbon cask (refill). It's awfully good and at 300 bucks..likely not worth this price but it's not far from it either. 3816 bottles made, if you see one and this is your wheel house it's a pretty easy pickup. 

4.0 due to the age, batch strength, natural color and that really spicy and aggressive finish. I wasn't sure what I would be getting and I'm pretty impressed. I'm actually worried I rated it heavily based on my surprise as I frankly expected disappointment (which begs why I would buy a 300 dollar bottle with disappointment expected...I have a problem)."
