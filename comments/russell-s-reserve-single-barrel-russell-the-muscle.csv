4.0,"I tasted this bourbon as part of a barrel pick by our friends at Lexington Beverage Outlet.  Master Distiller Jimmy Russell celebrates his 65th year of employment at the Wild Turkey Distillery and this bottle is in commemoration of that feat.  Jimmy was an impressive athlete and know in high school as Russell the Muscle.  This whiskey bourbon is named in his honor.

The whiskey bourbon presents a strong oak, maple, and slight vanilla to the nose. The mouth feel is thin and hot, with notes of sweet almond, butter, maple syrup, and caramel. The finish is long and strong with fruity notes and a peanut finish. More complex that the Russell’s 10 and both sweet and spicy.  Try it if you can get your hands on it.  It was the whiskey I served for Thanksgiving!"
