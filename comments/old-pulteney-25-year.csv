3.5,"Old Pulteney tasting event, Sydney, February 26, 2020, Whisky #5

Nose: Flowery stonefruit (peaches, apricots) and sweet citrus. Honeyed, grassy and a little spirity. Some fragrant woody notes.

Palate: Dry, briny honey with oak notes on the arrival. It opens into a fruit dominated palate as it develops with lots of sweet flavours – barley sugar and boiled lollies, cherries, rosewater and rosehip tisane. Some spicy notes float about in the background. It’s a softer palate than the 15 year old but less voluptuous than the 18. Water improves it by increasing the volume and mouthfeel.

Finish: Medium/short. Fades to briny, semi-sweet marmalade on the aftertaste with a little oak.

Ho hum. Pretty underwhelming. Like the 15 year old turned up in volume, but lighter than the 18 and spirity in comparison.

Not much more I can say about this as it left me feeling completely disinterested. There’s nothing bad going on, no off notes and it’s obviously well-crafted and matured, but it’s the most boring 25 year old whisky I’ve tasted for a good long while and there is no way I’d pay the asking price of $650 for a bottle.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"
3.5,"Nose- apricot, sandalwood, sea salt, orange marmalade, light oak, ginger spices

Palate- Honey, toasted almonds, toasted oak, toffee, ginger, creamy vanilla 

Finish- medium, creamy finish with notes of vanilla and ginger spice

Very complex nose on this one. Not too in your face, but many different dimensions and flavors. Palate is good, nothing to write home about though. Finish is medium, with nice flavors, but forgettable. For a 25 year whisky, I can’t help but be disappointed to be honest."

4.25,"Complex and deep but surprisingly has a little bit of a burn, more so than the 21. This one just isn’t worth it for me, good thing I only got a sample. 93"

4.0,The new Old Pulteneys are great. I may have preferred the 18 to the 25. Tasted at The Whisky Show London.

null,"** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

We made our way back to the OP after the VIP hour ended to try this 25yo and the NAS Navigator.  This 25 had similar maritime notes along with a fuller and richer sherry presence.  It was still a bit rough around the edges, if you compared it to Macallan or Balvenie, but overall it was a very nice, salty sweet dram.  I think I’m going to look into buying a bottle of this one to drink.  I’d give it 4.5 stars all day long.  Cheers."
