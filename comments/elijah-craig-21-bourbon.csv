5.0,"Yum. Would equate to 91 pts, moderate spice and mild peat, short finish, mild vanilla undertone."

4.5,"One of our local bars posted this beauty in our Whiskey community group and I just had to give it a try! Better yet they priced it at a reasonable price per pour given the scarcity ($650+ on secondary). 

I had about a 1.75 oz pour so had a decent sample size to review. Let's dive in:

Entry is really robust for 90 proof and very mouth coating without being very oily. As soon as it hits your palette you know you are dealing with a very well aged Bourbon. Rich burnt brown sugar, clove, tobacco with the oak definitely there but in perfect balance. Vanilla, cinnamon dusted almonds and leather come into play on the mid palette. Finish is long and packs a surprising punch given the proof. More oak and wood spice that lingers for ages. I could taste it for quite a while as I drove home. 

This is a single barrel so I can't garuntee you the same experience but to me this is a fantastic example of a really old Bourbon that has great wood driven notes without ever tasting over oaked. Strong recommendation if you can find it for a reasonable price per pour. Those in the metro Phoenix area, head down to Hundred North and grab a pour! Cheers all!"

4.0,"Haven't had too many of these, but there seems to be quite a bit of variation.
 
Barrel 154 (12.20.90) was excellent, barrel 21 (10.31.90) was an astringent, bitter, watery mess."

The Whiskey Fort Collins for the price of the 18 year"
