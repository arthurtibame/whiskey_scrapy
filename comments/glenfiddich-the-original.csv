3.0,"I love this for half the price. Didn't find as simple as some of the ratings. Tons of gingerbread, green apple and toffee to keep me smiling well into a second glass."

4.0,"This just sounded like such a gimmick, cashing in on the Mad Men craze and all. But, hey, looks are deceiving. This very light colored dram comes in a beautiful metal tin. It greets you with this apple oatmeal scent. It goes in fruity, touch of honey on oatcake. It's got a polite finish, doesn't linger. Love this. It's just an uncomplicated drink to end a complicated day."

3.0,"I was pleased and disapointed all at the same time. As the slogan says ""This is your grandfather's whisky"" I was expecting something so much more robust and oily. Something that could have built me a cabin after fishing. A very good whisky but I do believe this is Glennfiddich 12 masquerading around in a wolf costume."
