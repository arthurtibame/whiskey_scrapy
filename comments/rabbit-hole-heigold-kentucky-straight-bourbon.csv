4.0,"Nose: caramel, small hint of bananas, honeysuckle

Palate: butterscotch, light mouthfeel, refreshing. Not as rich as four roses single barrel, but similar “dessert” taste. 

Finish: light to moderate finish, warm but not too hot. Very drinkable, not overwhelming."

Dec. 19

Recommended by DMOYER. Thanks!

I’ve had an encounter with Rabbit Hole before, with the PX sherry finish version. It was pretty good, but ultimately not as good as WT Revival (though I don’t think that was a fair matchup based on age statement alone). This little guy has a 3 year age statement. It’s a straight bourbon whiskey at 95 proof.

Nose reminds me strongly of Woodford. I get banana, oak, sugar, and caramel. The sweet banana scent wins overall.

This is a very gentle, approachable body, which somehow tastes nothing like Woodford. My nose Pinocchioed me. It’s sweet and fruity, and the fruit activates in the back of my mouth, around my molars. This is a trick that (to date) I’ve only ever experienced from much older whiskeys, so that’s interesting. It’s more of a candy fruit flavor than something natural, but if I had to pick a fruit, I’d pick a golden delicious apple.

Hold on to your hat. Finish takes a hard left into spice world. Spice up your life, bruh. You get used to that hard cut over the course of the drink, but that first sip almost tore my ACL all over again. I get strong cinnamon, but there’s a sweetness too. Like a hot toddy without the mint. Tongue buzz on the front.

I know the body/finish demarcation line is a bit subjective, but for me the finish starts either right after you swallow or right when you notice a drastic change. This one has such a change that swallow or not, big red is coming. I have rarely tasted bourbons that have thoroughly different mission statements on nose, body, and finish. When I do, assuming the flavors are enjoyable and not Bertie Bott’s style, the bourbon tends to become a permanent member of my shelf. I can tell already that this little guy will be no different. This is one of my favorite new finds (of the readily available stuff) of 2019. Thanks again to DMOYER for turning my eyes back toward this distillery. They’re actually pretty legit!

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 12 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments. Don’t say WLW. I have a 2019, but I’m saving it.

Edit: I just noticed the community score. I know I probably say this too much to avoid entering holier-than-thou territory here, but the community at large got this wrong. Give it a shot if you like the flavors listed in this review. I got your back, Rabbit Hole."

4.0,"Sugar and Caramel on the nose.

Mild and slight pepper taste. Very easy to drink, low burn on the way down. Much more mellow then other bourbons."

3.5,First taste was sweet and chocolate finishes spicy.  After adding some ice to let it mellow the spice becomes more predominant

3.75,"Spice forward on the nose as well as on the tongue, all the way through. Tames in the middle, strong through the finish. Pairs especially well with dark chocolate. Great expression of a high rye."
4.0,"Strong oak on the nose, after it breathed for 5-10 minutes the nose changed completely. I was getting brown sugar and fruit notes.  On the pallet it also has a strong oak flavor with a touch of vanilla. After the same 5-10 minute breath, I was suddenly tasting a delicious toffee note."

4.5,"On the nose it's clean and sweet with a hint of pepper. 

Taste is extremely smooth with a lighter feel. Hints of banana and brown sugar, followed by a familiar spice/ pepper taste

Overall very enjoyable. Great on the nose and smooth through the whole experience. The lighter feel is unique for a non chill filtered bourbon in my experience. 

Would Recommend it."
