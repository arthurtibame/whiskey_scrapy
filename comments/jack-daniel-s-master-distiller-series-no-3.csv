I won't turn it down if provided to me but I will not purchase again."

4.25,"This is one of Jack Daniel's tribute bottles for one of their legendary Master Distillers, the Number 3 is for Lemuel Tolley. This one was quite a experience. 

Bottled at 43%abv, orange ambar color.

On the nose: Banana, Vanilla, Prunes, Cherries, Coconut, Sawdust. Cake burnt crest and Hazelnut. A slight Bitterness.
FERRERO ROCHER CHOCOLATES. Just wow. 

On the palate it is a little boring. Vanilla, Pepper, A little watery.

Aftertaste is perfect. Just two notes: Butter Scotch and Ferrero Rocher chocolates. 

Overall this one was totally different from other Jack Daniel's, not too balanced but definitively a rollercoaster. 85 over 100."
