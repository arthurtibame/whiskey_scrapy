4.0,"Solid flavor. Could use a higher proof but for $35, this is a great taste."
3.75,"I’m long overdue to sample and review a grocery store chain, Irish whiskey.  Thanks to a new trading partner from the southwest US, @dubz480, I’m able to do just that:  Trader Joe’s 15 Year Irish whiskey is heavily rumored to be juice that’s sourced from Bushmills and rebranded under the discount grocery chain’s nameplate.  I am unable to purchase any spirits from these stores because here in Virginia liquor is controlled by the state (Boooo).  No Trader Joe’s, no Kirkland or Costco brands for me.  I have to trade for samples if I hope to eventually try them.

That brings me to this 15 year old whiskey from Trader Joe’s:  it’s rumored to from Bushmills and diluted to 40% ABV.  I’m sure it’s chill filtered and probably has added color, which is a light and shiny caramel.  A spin in your favorite tasting vessel will leave heavy drops and watery legs in its wake.

The nose is predominantly butterscotch candies and honey, with some grassy and dried hay notes mingling about.  Some floral properties appear along with typical oak barrel notes of vanilla.  There’s no bite or hint of the lowered ABV, but it’s not boring by any means.  The palate offers up orchard fruit and hints of Juicy Fruit chewing gum and measured amounts of toffee.  It starts to feel like a creamy, post-dinner dessert with a warm and creamy mouth coat before some citrus interrupts the finale- in a good way.  It cuts the sweet tooth feel just in time.  The finish remains luscious and smooth, though, with soft and lingering fruitiness.  

Overall, it nails down a traditional Irish whiskey identity.  Smooth and creamy with soft, fruit notes.  I think the 15 years in an ex-bourbon cask, although maybe not first fill, has played well here.  I hear price points are in the low $30-range, which is a solid deal.  What you lose in complexity you certainly make up for in value for your money.  I think it could benefit in a slight boost in bottling strength, to say 43%, but it’s still pretty solid for what you get.  3.5-3.75 stars.  Cheers."
3.25,"I know what you are thinking. Grocery store Whiskey? Seriously? This has now invalidated every previous review! 😂. However, this one isn't half bad! First some background. This is exclusive to Trader Joe's and is age stated at 15 years old. It's a single malt and is aged in first fill ex-bourbon barrels. It's triple distilled in small copper stills. Now @1901 please keep me honest, based on this info and it being 15 yrs old we can safely assume this is sourced from Bushmills. With that said and it running just over $30 we know we are dealing with a really solid value if nothing else. On to the tasting!
It enters soft with an array of orchard fruits, passion fruit with a hint of toffee. The mid pallette features a spice swell (clove, black pepper and a hint of cinnamon) leading to a pretty long butterscotch, toffee apple and malt driven finish. 
Mouthfeel is a little watery which is a big let down. Spice does however linger on the tongue for a long while. 
Now if this was bottled at 90 proof or greater (it's bottled at 80 proof) and had some fortified wine finishing it would be an outstanding dram (Bushmills 16 year I am looking hard at you!!). As it is the lower proof and lack of a bit more sweetness holds this one back. 
However, let's again put this in perspective. It's a $32 bottle!! I'd still drink the Green Spot and Redbreast 12 over it, but it's not out of place with that crowd (albeit a bit of a distant 3rd). 
Long story short, if you shop at Trader Joe's and want a solid value daily drinker, this one fits the bill. 
TGIF All!"
3.0,"Very pleasant classic Irish pot still taste, but a bit watery on the pallet."
4.0,"Disclaimer: My only real metric these days is, 'Does a shot give me instant heartburn?'

That said, it certainly passes that test. Very smooth. Not overly sweet - very mild hint of cinnamon."
