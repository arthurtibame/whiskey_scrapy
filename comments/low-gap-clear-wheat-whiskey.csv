4.0,Smooth tasting for a young whiskey.  Nose smells like it might take paint off the wall but lands smoothly on the palate with hints of wood and spice.  No need for water or ice to bring out the flavor. It will overly dilute this whiskey.

4.0,"This is waaaaaaay better than I expected. Plum/prune and toffee on the nose. Almond paste too, plus this may be the first time in my life I have picked up stewed apples, but its there. It's  is clean, fresh and fruity (ripening nectarines or peach, with some citrus edge to it) on the pallet. It has soft black pepper on the short finish, but less so than many. About 2/3 the pepper of Toki for example. It's hard to describe since it also has a ""new"" flavor to it, but its also clearly of good quality. I'm truly enjoying it neat. 4 stars for wowing me with a white dog that is a treat to drink and educate myself with. I got a great deal on my bottle when a local store closed it out so keep your eyes open wherever you are. It was a steal."
