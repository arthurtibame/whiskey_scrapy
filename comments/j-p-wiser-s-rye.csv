3.0,"(3.20.15) Preface my review with the fact that I got this on sale, with rebate for a grand total of $4.25 for the bottle. I couldn't lose. 

For the price, this was a home run. Disregarding the price I am still fairly pleased with the value I got. I would even go so far as to tick off the Crown folks out there by saying I would take this over standard Crown most days of the week. 

I appreciate Paul's (reviewer) comment about not calling this a rye if blindfolded. I totally agree. This lacks the spice I expected and instead just reminds me of a rye influenced fresh bread. It is fairly sweet with a strong alcohol odor.

[6.26.18] An update. Probably won't buy this again but it provided another nice evening with friends over ice. Sweet and fresh, light spice. I gave the last half of the bottle to a homeless man in Knoxville; at least he was honest and asked me for a drink instead of money ""for food""."

2.0,"Light body, light color. Smooth all the way. Nice and sweet."
4.0,"Oh, the weather outside is frightful...so I guess I'm stuck inside with a few 50ml samples to try.  First up:  Canadian blend  J.P. Wiser's Rye.  It's your standard 80 proof and looks really clean in the Glencairn.  I'm not sure what a full bottle costs, but I doubt it's really expensive.

The nose consists of everything you expect from a blended, rye whiskey:  oak, peppers and a hint of vanilla.  No surprises here, except maybe that they are all a bit muted.

On the tongue it's quite enjoyable, especially for a rye (not my favorite style of whiskey by a long shot).  There's lots of vanilla and oak present, while the pepper and cinnamon notes take a back seat.  The finish is quick and to the point.  Smooth and creamy with no kick.

Very seldom do I find myself enjoying rye (or Canadian) whiskies.  It seems like I always end up recommending them as mixers and that's about it.  This one actually stands up on its own when neat and I can really appreciate that.  This might be my favorite Canadian whiskey to date.  Cheers."

2.0,First Rye.  Actually drank it all and forgot to rate it.  I wouldn't turn it away but it is not going to be my first choice after having tasted a few others.

3.5,"Good flavors, but too weak and thin."
2.5,"Appearance: This blended Canadian had a caramel syrup color with thick watery legs.

Nose: The nose was inoffensive in every way. Notes like caramel apples, maple syrup, and vanilla greeted me first, followed by ground black pepper, green banana, and a faint hint of fresh carrots.

Taste: The uncomplicated palate boasted a creamy mouthfeel, with notes of peppery spice, Irish cream coffee creamer, and vanilla. 

Finish: It had a shorter length sweet finish.

Thoughts: This whisky was pretty alright. Nothing to write home about, but for an easy sipper while watching The Office after getting home from work, I didn’t mind it one bit. It’s definitely a sweet Canadian blend, but if you want a cheap easy drink, it’ll do. Thanks, J. P.! Cheers!"
