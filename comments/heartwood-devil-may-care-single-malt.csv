3.0,"This isn't the Heartwood I had but it isn't listed here. I had a half nip of the Heartwood @#$%^&* 2006 10yo Tasmania Distillery Port Sherry Finish 
500ml 62.50%. It was my birthday and I'd been with Riss and black Steve and CC to Feral drinking Biggie Juice and accidentally ordered two beers at once cos the bartender dun fucked up and then I drank a real high abv imperial stout and it was all a slippery slope. Long story shorter CC still loved me enough to take me to Spritz for pasta my favourite where the waiter slams down your ragu and shouts WALLA! Then to Measure for dessert where they had half nips of this going for cost price which was handy. It tasted rich and full with a slight burn and really long finish of toasted nuts and stewed apple and rhubarb pie. Or not, I was pretty drunk by that stage. Called in sick for work the next day. Standard"
