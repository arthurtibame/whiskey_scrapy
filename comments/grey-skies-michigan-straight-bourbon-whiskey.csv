2.0,"Corn oil and vegetal smell on the nose, got a bit of corn starch smell but only after my brother in law mentioned it lol. These notes continue on the palate and not much more happens, goes down way too easy. There is a very faint pleasant taste in the back(fruit) that I couldn’t quite identify that says this might benefit from a few more years inside the barrel, as I’m pretty sure my bottle is not a day older than the minimum 2 years stated by grey skies. Kind of reminded me of hudson baby bourbon, which I’m not a fan. Taste too young for my liking."
