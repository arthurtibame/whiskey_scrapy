2.25,"Incredibly sweet aroma, and tons of caramel sweetness on the tongue. A touch better than the regular Rebecca Creek, but it's clear they add the flavoring later."

Sometimes, when surrounded by that much complexity, you crave a Bud Light. Something you can mindlessly drink but still enjoy.  This is the Bud Light of bourbon."

3.0,"Right off the bat from the nose you can tell this is sweetened. Although a little too sugary for my preference, it is undoubtedly very smooth and pulls off the vanilla and caramel notes that it promises. All in all, pleasantly surprised at the flavor combo, but too sweet to drink regularly."

4.0,"So here is my amateur review-lol. Super heavy caramel both on the nose and the palate, without a lot of spiciness. Not much bite on the front end, but very smooth with a pleasant finish. Easy sipper on ice, probably wouldn’t mix except with water or soda. Honestly, right up my alley."
