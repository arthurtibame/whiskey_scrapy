2.5,"This rye new make is quite clear with thin viscous legs.

The nose is sweet and floral with notes of dandelion, ripe pineapple, mild rye spice, and pond algae.

The palate is sweet and simple with notes of cherry, grapefruit, breakfast toast, and a tannic taste.

The finish is tingling, mild, and of medium length.

Cheers!"
