4.0,"The nose is mild with butterscotch and oak, with hints of mint and rye spices, caramel, leather and the least bit of baking spices. The palate is somewhat oily with strong rye spices and is buttery and creamy of butterscotch and caramel, with brown sugar and some floral notes. The finish is medium long with a lasting rye spiciness, as the mouth stays oily and creamy from fading butterscotch and caramel. This is a 1930s post-prohibition release and is simple but delicious."
