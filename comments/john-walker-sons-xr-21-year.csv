2.0,It's smooth.  That's about it.  Not an exciting whisky at all.

5.0,"Bought a bottle of this on a cruise for $150  and it did not disappoint!  On the nose: toffee and oak. I learned to let it breath for a good 15 mins before I even had a sip.  The dram is just what you want a scotch to be, smooth and rich.  Your pallet is bathed in more toffee and butterscotch, with a bit of roasted coffee, a generous helping of smoke, and just the right hint of peat and spice.  The finish is long with big oak and tobacco.  Would buy this again in a heartbeat."

4.0,"For an aged blend, the expected smoothness is there. unfortunately my palate is not sensitive enough to tell why this would cost so much more than the Blue or the Gold blends. for the money, I'll get a few bottles of the gold reserve."

3.0,Hot and harsh for the age. Tastes like a 12 year old sherry cask.

The finish is drying with fruitiness."

3.25,"On the nose, butterscotch and a little heat. It tastes woody and sweet. Light smoke and light baking spice. It envelopes the palate and the finish is long. This is better than I remember, would drink again."

4.5,"Similar to the 18 yet richer and fuller, likely because of the extra age, despite having only 40%. It’s classic Speyside sweetness mixed with Island smokiness. 94"

5.0,"ok this is fantastic. like the best whisky ever or close to that. very diferent to my other favorite the hibiki harmony, Johnnie Walker XR 21 is beautiful on the nose with a very creamy vanilla note, if you pour a drop on your hand it will smell like the seed from a peach and if you let it sit for a couple of minutes you'll also get a tiny orange or some other citrus fruit note. on the palate you get a very spicy almost hot sensation, and the finish is medium with a mild smoke sensation. this is a very complex and beautiful whisky. by far the best i had so far"

4.25,"NOSE: Pretty grainy initial impression. Caramel. Vanilla. Some butter.

PALATE: Sweet caramel and brown butter. Rich thick cream. Mildly spicy finish of candied ginger and baked cinnamon. Deelicious.

OVERALL: Luscious exquisite palate, somewhat let down by a simple nose."
