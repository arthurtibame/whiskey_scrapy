2.0,Light and hints of Apple...nice but thin
4.0,"Highlands have never really been my thing, but I have to admit I have a soft spot for Tullibardine - they make great stuff. This one doesn't disappoint: apples, vanilla, and cinnamon enveloped in faintly charred oak. It's almost a timid bourbon, except with really strong notes of barley."

4.0,Le vieillissement en tonneaux de bourbon lui donne définitivement une note plus caramel que ses frères plus vieux. Définitivement un plus en terme de rapport qualité prix

F: Gentle spice."
3.5,"Smooth with a drop of water, nice"
4.25,"This is really quite excellent. It is malty, floral, slightly sweet, and somewhat ""thick"" on the tongue. The flavors are quite clean and crisp. Very easy to over-indulge on this one being so tasty and easy to drink. I think the flavors are somewhat akin to Glenmorangie 10, though slightly less floral. Even though this is a NAS whisky, I find it to be as smooth as any 10-12 year old. This must surely be at least 8 years old on the average. Most sources list this for around $50, a little over priced IMO, but I lucked out and bought a case at close out prices. Yeah me!"

4.0,"Vanilla, orchard fruit, and malt on the nose. Creamy mouthful, with tasty combination of citrus, pears, and cinnammon spice on the palate. Relatively dry finish of medium length. Overall a solid offering and good value ($71 CAD) from this distillery. Worth trying."
