3.25,"Ok so I like the Tomatin 12 year so figured Id give this a shot. This is aged in virgin oak similar to Deanston Virgin oak which I also think is great. Poured neat, nose jumps out of the glass with chocolate, marshmallow and pastry dough. First thing that came to mind was a chocolate croissant. Settles a bit into some fresh apple, malt, dusty cardboard and traces of wood. Lot going on for a low$20 bottle of scotch. Mouth feel is somewhat thin and the youth shows up with some sizzle but there is a healthy dose of flavor. Neapolitan ice cream, honey and malt morph into apple,dry roast coffee and pine wood. If this had some depth to these flavors it would be amazing. Still very enjoyable. Finishes with vanilla, coffee and malt fading to drying oak. Overall very pleased especially at this price point. Tomatin seems to be a solid brand with high quality malts. Its a light youthful scotch however if you can look past the lack of refinement there is a lot to like........82/100"

3.5,"The nose has butterscotch, sarsaparilla, pears, and freshly printed paper. On the palate you get sweet oak, lemon zest, fresh cut grass, and cinnamon. The finish is a little spicy but enjoyable. 

This scotch is a great value for the money. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a light/young speyside. I think this is better than Tomatin 12, and on par with Glenfiddich 12 for a lot less money."

3.75,"Just want to put in my two cents on this young malt.  I mostly want to draw attention again to this excellent value malt. Having been aged in both ex-bourbon and virgin oak barrels, there is little char evident, and more vanilla than usually associated with a youthful NAS malt. On the palate there is gentle sweetness, citrus (lemon?), vanilla, and yellow spongecake. The finish is true and gentle and very little burn. This is not the Scotch you drink when contemplating the current state of mankind. This is the Scotch you drink when you want to enjoy a very tasty dram (or two) that will not break the bank, nor demand your total concentration."
3.5,Im new to whiskey but my first impression was definitely a vanilla aroma. Tasting it there was more of a citrus feel. Overall not bad for the price.

2.0,"Dualchas expression from Tomatin is a no age statement (NAS) bottling that is probably the most budget friendly out of any Single Malt Scotches, starting at $24 from Total Wine. The nose on this whisky is incredible with apricots, golden raisins, and candied ginger and orange peel. The palate and the finish is a bit of a let down as the nose promises more than what this bottle delivers. Some vanilla and a bit honey sweetness followed by citrus notes before quickly burning out with notes of charred oak and black pepper. More substance is hoped for but it is hard to complain when it is only $24. While I may only pick this up again to use in cocktails, it sold me on giving their other expressions a whirl."

5.0,"Nose: Honey, lemon and pears 

Taste: Honey, lemon and pears, slight vanilla 

Finish: light barrel spice honey lemon and pears"
3.25,"Spicy, sweet."
4.0,"Box description: light sweetness to the tongue. Aromas of vanilla, marshmallows, pineapple and lemon. On the palate gentle flavors of candy, pine, lemon sherbet, apples and sponge cake. Light clean finish. 

Personally love the scotch. Really mellow flavors on the tongue, I personally narrow it down to being a little spicy in the sense of alcohol content. All other flavors/feels are super mellow."
