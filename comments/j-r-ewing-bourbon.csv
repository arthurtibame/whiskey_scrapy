2.0,No real character to it but not overly cheap tasting either.  The bottle is the best thing about this bourbon.  May become a mixer for cocktails.

3.0,"Similar to old Forrester, lots of vanilla, some oak, short finish."
2.0,"[02.08.2017] Tolerable if free. Turned down a lot of go-tos to try this and check off my list in a bar with poor service and loud music - Madison, WI. Smooth and mostly flavorless, this was like taking a good corn whiskey, diluting with city water and putting in a used barrel for a while. Don't bother."

2.0,"Smells like a nice, 4-star hotel room. I know that's weirdly specific. On the tongue, unique, plastic and organ meats. But not in a bad way. Smooth, light. Short finish. 7/12/17"

3.75,"80 proof and a good taster.  Kentucky hug all over first sip, but mellows out in the end.  12/24/18 Christmas Eve from Marcus."

2.0,"Tried it in the Glencairn glass.
Overpoweringly floral and chemical.
Seriously tasted bad. Like crayons.
Sadly, no negative stars.

Two months later.
Red plastic cup. Vastly improved. Actually drinkable. I don’t know what to say.
No, it’s a two star rating."

2.0,It got a 2* because I like the bottle. Drain pour
2.25,"A little too light for a bourbon. Does have a nice aftertaste. Definitely has a feel of a caramel finish, but sugar free, which isn't a bad thing."

2.25,"Seems ""thin"" overall. Tried neat at first. On the nose was a vegetal smell and it had a rye/grain forward taste, with a quick finish. Added a standard ice cube per roughly 2 shots of this liquor and it changed the flavor a bit for the better: light notes of vanilla, cocoa powder, smooth...still a quick finish. This will be a one time buy because there's better out there on the market at this price point."
3.0,Solid for the money. Nothing amazing but definitely worth drinking. More than 1 glass. Hahahah
