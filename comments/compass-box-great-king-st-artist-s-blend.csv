3.5,"Honey sweet & just very slightly smoky. Enjoyed neat from a glencairn at a restaurant. This is our first time sitting at a bar in 3 months. For the sake of my marriage I'll keep this short, if I could find a bottle and it was priced at MSRP I would buy it without hesitation."

3.75,"The palate is floral, citrus, and honey.  Very refreshing.  The nose covers much the same ground as the palate. The palate fades quickly, and wraps up with a citrus finish.  After 20-30 seconds, the finish is only a memory with a hint of lingering malt sweetness.  (During a follow on session, there was a splendid white wine note.)  This blend is even tastier than a few entry-level single malts like Dewar's, Glenlivet, and Glenfiddich 12 -- and at only $5-10 higher in price.  This is quite good, and for $30-40 it is definitely a pick for session drinking.

3.5,"A blended scotch, mostly made by lowland grain whiskies, a cheap expression of Compass Box. 

Bottled at 43%abv deep gold color.

On the nose a dim, soft aroma: Lemon, Coffee, Candy. Not too much happening here.

On the palate a little better. Chocolate (typical from grain), Pepper, Oak so pleasant and smooth and Plant spicyness like oregano. Finish is very short. Dissapointing.

Overall i give this dram a very regular 71 over 100. Not the best hour for compass box in this one."

2.0,"The only underwhelming Compass Box whisky I've tried. The nose is light and fruity; I think of lemon-creme sandwich cookies and it's pleasant enough. But the palate is thin and wimpy. There's a buttery vanilla note, some sweet corn. The finish is short and leaves you wanting."

4.0,"[Re-Review 01/26/16] Pale as hay. Faint vanilla, salted caramel, and straw on the nose.  Very light, sweet silky texture, that goes down easily.  Mushy banana purée perhaps?  It comes rough right out of the bottle, so it requires a few minutes to sit in order to soften up.  Addition of water creates a milky sweetness that could go either way.   Moderate lingering finish.  Nice burn on the tongue. Comparing it to other blends in it's range I believe it does much better, but it's still nothing too amazing.  I would give it a 3.5 if I could."
4.0,88pts. Very good blend.
4.0,Delightfully creamy and smooth.
3.0,"The nose is rather faint, even in a Glencairn, but if I work at it for a bit, I can pull out a bit of apple and nutmeg, so I guess Stephanie is pretty spot on with the apple pie reference.  I also get a bit of earthiness, almost like potting soil fresh out of the bag.  The palate opens fruity, smooth and creamy, than the heat arrives and balances things out, leading to a little spice in the middle before finishing with a floral hint and a bit more apple and vanilla.  Not a bad drink by any stretch, and so much better than the more popular blends.  Compass Box is doing good stuff, but either this just isn't my style of Scotch (it's not, really), or I expect a bit more for a blend containing over 50% malt.  It's smooth and creamy, but it's not exciting; it doesn't pull me back for another sip to see what else I can find hiding in the aroma, to hunt for flavors tucked behind the initial burst of light fruity sweetness.  If you don't like smoke, you don't like peat, you don't like much depth of complexity, and you just want a decent drink for a decent price, this is your ticket.  For me, I tend to look at it more as Scotch without the malt, or Irish with half the flowers and fruit."

4.0,"A quiet evening to sit back a relax with a movie and, of course, a dram.  As this was sitting unopened for some time, tonight I chose to remedy that situation.  Apple betty, butterscotch, sugar cookie with a touch of lemon and straw comprise the nose.  Somewhat akin to Irish Whiskey (Jameson 12?).  Almost clear in color, a creamy body arrives sweet, creme brûlée but overly so, that quickly dissipates.  White pepper spice quickly replaces the sweetness, with a small amount oak a citrus.  These flavors do not stay around very long and all fade in a short period of time.  However, the finish is relatively long and the palate is left oaky and dry and delicately vanilla sweet, with no one note dominant over the other.  A well-blended dram that carries itself as a single malt, and in some comparisons, better than some single malts.  Respectfully priced, enjoyable, simple, fun, balanced and relatively anonymous .

Palate: sweet honeyed beginning, with development bringing more orchard fruits, and some green tea. With more sips, some nuts present themselves, as well. 

Finish:  medium length, spicy, and nutty with hints of dark brown sugar. 

Dry glass:  oak, cedar, and brown sugar. 

Enjoyable blend, and can be found in my area for about $40. Good stuff for the price. Accounting for price/value, I give it 85 points for a solid 4 stars."

I've gone back and forth on this dram before settling on it being a  good ""daily driver"" when you want to save your more spendy scotch for special occasions. Neat or in a cocktail, the Artists Blend is entirely serviceable. A good value for the price, too, at $40/750ml. Flavors tend toward apple, oak or maybe vanilla, and grapefruit for me. Also, the label is fantastic, as is all of Compass Box's graphic design. Not relavant to it's quality as a whisky, of course, but the presentation in the bottle is really rather nice."

Similar to Compass Box Asyla but with a bit more body and bit heavier.

Careful with this one... 2-3 pours go down pretty easily. 

$35 at total wine. Good value for a solid blended scotch."

3.0,"Nose: Lightly fruity with soft peach, pear, apple, citrus and a little vanilla. You can certainly smell good oak at work and there is that distinctive ethanol nose from grain whisky.

Palate: Featuring exactly the same elements as the nose, the arrival is soft and fruity then turning mildly spicy in the development as a little ginger shows up.

Finish: Short, but there are some lingering oak notes. The spicy/peppery kick from the development flows through into the finish.

This was the first Compass Box whisky I tried and to begin with I was not much impressed. It seemed thin and lacking in both the nose and palate at first, however over time I came to appreciate it.

I didn't like this so much neat but when used as a mixer the spicyness and oak notes give the spirit body and stop it being overpowered. In a highball this is not unlike some Japanese blended whiskies, with a subtle but slightly spicy character that is refreshing and enjoyable. There is also a floral note that emerges when it is diluted.

It's very classy and different to most traditional ""old-school"" blended scotch in that it has a fresh and uncomplicated character. It reminded me of a cleaner and more zesty Ballantine's Finest.

The only issue is the price, which puts it in the same league as some good middle-shelf single malts.  If you are looking for an impressive and sophisticated whisky to use primarily or exclusively as a mixer this would be a good choice, but don't expect it to be heavy or richly flavoured - quality, refinement and elegance are the keywords.

  ""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

4.0,"Updated review:  5/15/18.  I decided to open a bottle of the Artist’s Blend to do a comparison between it and a bottle of the Artist’s Blend Single Marrying Cask.  The latter is a special bottling done by Compass Box for certain retailers and offered in very limited numbers.  Please see the Artist’s Blend Marrying Cask for a review of that specific bottle.  This is an update for the normal release.

First of all, let’s look at the ingredients and breakdown:  46% is Cameron Bridge single grain whisky, 29% is ex-American-oaked Clynelish, 17% is CBW’s in-house blend of 3 Highland malts that have aged in new French oak, and 8% of Linkwood aged in sherry casks.  All ages of the whisky used is undisclosed.  (Thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for getting the breakdown info from Compass Box for me.)

The Artist’s Blend has a nice buttery, apple pie flavor albeit with a decent amount of cask influence coming through.  There’s some nice vanilla and apple notes ringing through.  It really is buttery smooth and completely easy to drink.  The finish is short, though, while still being quite tasty.

It’s a fantastic, sweet sipper that would probably also play very well in various whisky-based cocktails.  It’s a solid 3.5-3.75 star caliber dram.  I’m glad I have a couple bottles of both this and the Glasgow.  Never mind a few bottles of the rarer NY Blend (peated).  Good stuff.  CBW does it right 90% of the time.  Spend $40 with confidence, my friends."

4.5,"Compass Box - the hipster’s blend. Well, that’s just the reputation, this bottle is the Artist’s Blend. It’s a core entry-level offering from Compass Box (alongside its Great King St brethren, the Glasgow blend), but not included in the infamous 5 signature blends sampler. An absolute gem in my opinion.

One of my recent key criteria is drinkability/repeatability since I tend to purchase bottles vs samples or one-off drinks at the local watering holes and this bottle ticks the box perfectly. Reaching for this one regularly before any other in my collection is a good sign. Appearance is super light yellow & nose is a fragrant blend of apples, butter, lemon, and a surprisingly pleasant alcohol aroma. For me, the Artist’s Blend comes alive on the palate. Those apples from the nose turn into Honeycrisp (my fave) alongside some vanilla notes, wood spices, and a hint of smoke way off in the distance. Completely delicious (disclaimer: the light profile a great fit for this balmy SoCal climate).

Rating: Would probably bump the Distiller score up to the low 90s. Rounded up to 5 stars based on pure enjoyment. Bonus pts too since I found it under $40 even at the neighborhood store that marks everything up 20-25%. Cheers ya’ll"

Nose:  Wow!  Heavy apricot up front but super sweet almost like canned apricot in syrup.  Musty wood notes in the background, with a kind of funky finish that smells like a hint of mint and red wine.

Flavor: Not at all like the smell.  Kind of thick and coating but unpleasantly medicinal right up front with a pretty strong harsh bitter wood flavor.  Very sweet with citrus and dried pears on the background.

Finish: Medium length with quite an ethanol punch towards the finish.  A bit spicy with toasted wood notes but still bitter and medicinal.

This was super hyped and I really wanted to love it.  The nose was fantastic but I just couldn't get past the weird bitter medicinal cough-syrupy notes in the flavor and finish.  It tastes like I'd imagine Robitussin aged in oak barrels would taste."

Bonus is non chill filtered and no coloring. Got this for around $35 so value is good as well. Poured neat(maybe 1 drop to open) nose is light fruit and malt with a touch of barrel/char. Smells fresh and balanced. Palate is smooth malt, ripe red apple drizzled with honey and just a flash of peat. Finish is malty barrel, fading dried fruits with char slightly drying. This is not super complex or thought provoking but it is delicious. Easy drinking with rich flavors at a solid price point I certainly recommend. Good for beginners without any real off notes as the lowland grain component is mild. I will be exploring the rest of the Compass line now for sure.......86/100 blend score"
4.0,"Tasty blended scotch. Great sipper. Real easy to drink. Best taken neat. Letting it open up in a glass for 5-10 minutes prior to drinking reveals a warmer tone to compliment the prominent fruity and vanilla notes. VERY good bang for your buck.

Bonus tip: try pairing it with a cigar!"
