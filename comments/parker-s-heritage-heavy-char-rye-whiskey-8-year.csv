2.75,"Nutmeg, cinnamon, and all spice on the nose with a brown sugar undertone. Very rye pallette through and through with a mild burn in the middle and a dry finish. Not worth its price but certainly not bad."

4.25,"Letting this open up for a few minutes did it wonders and the higher ABV along with the kick of the rye gives it a nice little punch! I tend to prefer barrel proofs anyway so this is right up my alley. The good part is sometimes when a whiskey packs some heat the flavor is lost which is not the case here. I found the finish to be very long and lingering which I was really impressed with. It may be  hard to justify the price tag because you can get multiple other bottles of great stuff at this price point but I do feel this one is unique enough and still a winner in my book! Would I go grab another bottle at this price, probably not, but I don’t regret adding it to my collection. Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed this pour!"
4.5,I agree entirely with the Distilller write up. Perfectly described. Super smooth. A big winner for me.

5.0,"The nose is incredible, like I was standing in field of pine trees. The palate is surprisingly sweet with flavors that really balance out the char smoke. The finish is silky smooth, with the leathery the spice and char flavors."
4.0,"Rich, dark brown butter, hay, cut grass, tobacco, honey, coffee"
3.0,"Smells soapy. Some unripened bananas. Actually a good nose. Tastes like... disappointment. Opens up after a while. Some fake peanuts, some bitter chocolate. Its solid, but nothing stands out. My expectations were out of whack. 12/6/19"

3.75,Very vanilla forward with banana and honey.
4.0,"A warm, floral on the nose. Thick, oily across the palate with a building peppery spice finish that goes long.
Great pour."

3.75,"Nose: whoa robust: caramel, cherry, molasses, vanilla, beautiful nose. Later rye snuck out and strengthened with time. 

Body: medium and thin

Palate: cherry, caramel, vanilla

Finish: long and Smokey, very delicious. 

Note:  this is a really beautiful whiskey. Great nose, nice Smokey caramel flavor."

4.0,"Light sweetness on the nose, with heavy notes of oak, char and dark fruits. Smells somewhat medicinal. Almost no sweetness on the palate, heavy wood spice character. Lot of spice on the front of the tongue, and more char on the finish. The texture is decently light and a bit oily. Overall a really interesting expression but not a bottle I would seek out again."

4.0,"So I ""won"" the right to buy this one...I shoulda selected better bottles. We'll get to the review but I'm still shocked at myself for spending 150 bucks on an 8 year old whisky.

Nose - A lot of typical rye notes. I do get a bubble gum note at first. I'm getting spice, charred oak (deep char), some cinnamon, some vanilla.  After a bit i'm getting a baked apple pie with some dusty wood. With each nosing I get a different version of this, always rye forward, always with a lot of oak, but the sweetness levels and the fruits just keep changing. A drop of water brings out vanilla cream, actually really nice, but it kills some of the spice and oak. I think I like the water better here.

Taste - I had the parker's bourbon just the other day and I was surprised that it reminded me so much of their rye. Today, I'm not getting those same associations, but I fully believe there is an element to the brand that seems to come through on the spirits. It's a brand sadly due to price and availability that I am unlikely to get to explore in depth anytime soon. This is sweet, fruity, and then it goes into spices, then into rye flavors and then into oak and barrel notes. There are at least 4 distinct transitions in here. 

This is as sweet as a bourbon. It has as much of that barrel char as a good aged bourbon. It however has that unique rye note and comes full force with rye spices. I don't get dill btw...so that's a huge win. There is a note near the end I can't place it. It's almost chocolate but it isn't and it is almost butter but it isn't. It's somewhere between the two, very enjoyable.

Water I'm not sure it does a lot. I think it brings out a bit more sweetness up front and the finish is taking on a bit more chocolate vs that butter. Overall the whole mid game of spice and oak and sweet playing into transitions are all pretty similar.

OK - this is fantastic whisky. This is an absolute home run, so in my face for turning my nose up at 8 years. I am not a rye guy, this is not my wheel house, and I would not buy again. That said I'm going 4 stars. This is one of if not the best rye I have had, outside of the 23 year kentucky vintage.  I would buy again at 100 just as I don't like spending over 100 on rye whisky, though I do to continue to educate myself."
1.0,"It’s not a good whiskey let alone a limited release. 

The spice and ethanol taste on the palate is too over powering and makes it one dimensional. It’s a shame the parkers heritage lines a usually excellent but 2019 and 2018 have been such a miss by heaven hill. What a shame!

Do yourself a favor, pass on this and get something else instead."
4.25,"Very interesting to say the least. 
Love the nose
If you are a diehard Bourbon Drinker you will appreciate the complexities of this 8 Year Rye. 
The 105 proof is a mouthful and really does not disappoint if anything it presents itself as a higher proof  and not as excessive heat...Proof and heat balanced
I love that a portion of the proceeds of every bottle of all Parker's releases to date benefits ALS research the disease that Parker suffered from and unfortunately sadly lost his battle to.
Therefore drinking any Parker's release to me is special and i might add .25 just for the love of drinking any Parkers release as I am a HUGE FAN.
The #5 Char is spicier and not as sweet as the traditional #3.
Try not to compare it...just enjoy it
What i mean is some might say Pikesville is less money or whatever whiskey one ""might"" compare but Pikesville or... is not a #5 Char Parker's Heritage Rye 
This for me is very good, not a daily drinker assuming retail price and unlimited availability, yeah i know lol just sayin, 
So for me there are some ryes i do enjoy more, however definitely Paker's Rye is a very worthy, different, only Parkers Rye ever, so it is a special pour especially a great pour to share with friends."

4.0,"A good rye, the extra age and char make it notably better than pikesville. 100 dollars better....no. Not as sweet as pikesville, nice spicy finish."
