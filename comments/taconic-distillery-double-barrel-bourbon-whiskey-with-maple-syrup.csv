4.0,Not overly sweet
3.0,"Too sweet for my liking. Hotter than the proof suggests. Flavors fade fast afterwards, but the burn lingers."
4.0,"I’ve not liked a single flavored whiskey yet.  I always thought the flavors all muddled together, or it was overly sweet, or it just seemed like a bad marriage like something conceived when drunk in Las Vegas near a wedding chapel.  

But...this, this I liked.  So, I was at the wine store yesterday buying a six pack of near alcohol free beer ( yes, it exists, and I love it!  25 calories, <1gm carb, 0.5% ABV!!  But I may be alone in that fondness...).  Anyway, they were giving samples of this.  A bit of conversation with the burly northern woodsman style chap quickly informed me that it’s made by taking bourbon barrels that once had Taconic bourbon, filling those with maple syrup, and then selling that maple syrup.  Those same barrels are then filled with bourbon, and laid to rest.  So...theoretically, it’s not flavored whiskey.  

Aromas of maple and shortbread.  What’s not to love?  Taste like—sweet low sugar pancake syrup, with a tinge of heat and bitterness, just to remind you that you shouldn’t be pouring this over your kid’s plate of waffles.  

I almost bought a bottle.  Almost,  but then I realized it might be great as a one off unique pour, but wasn’t convinced as a regular item on the shelf.  Nonetheless...if you have a sweet tooth, this is right up your alley."

null,"Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. Interesting take on bourbon with notes of corn, maple syrup, and vanilla."

4.0,I’m sure bourbon purists will find something to knock about this bourbon. The truth is it’s a very pleasant whiskey with a nice finish. I️ love when New York distilleries produce quality bourbons. Enjoy!
