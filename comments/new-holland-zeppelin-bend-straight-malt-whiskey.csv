4.0,"Smooth single malt, low burn"
4.25,"I think this stuff is crazy! I love how it finishes, but find it difficult to describe."
1.0,"A guy walks into a bar and orders a three dram whiskey flight.  The bartender says, ""we're all out of third whiskey you selected"".  The guy quickly scans the menu and thinks, ""Zeppelin Bend.  Cool name.  Why not?""

I'm still searching for the punch line.

The nose has some vanilla, but some weird funk and possibly some acetone.  And it gets worse from there.  The palate is just plain weird and disjointed, and it finishes with stale beer and more weird funk. 

I've never had anything like Zeppelin Bend before, and I hope it remains that way."

1.0,"Strange and not in a good way.  Texture and mouthfeel are severely lacking.  Flavor is just off, might be the worst I've had to date.  Maybe only 1 star."

2.0,Nose invoked the outdoors. Initial pallet was spicy. Which isn't what I remembered. Second sip was mild and that outdoorsy note on the nose comes through in the palette. Not much finish. Fun to try again as it had been a few years and I wasn't much into whiskey then. Bottom line is I'm not sure what I think.

4.0,Light spicy. Relatively smooth. Not a bad aftertaste.
