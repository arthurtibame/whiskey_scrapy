2.0,"Gave this to a friend who just got into bourbon as a starting point. Simple, sweet with notes of vanilla, spices and coconut. Young and bold, but definitely still drinkable when neat. Personally not a big bourbon fan, but for the price is it a decent choice. 2.6 out of 5"

2.0,Closer to the “meh” end of the spectrum. May just be a victim of brand hype and unrealistic expectations. Looking forward to the SB and SiB versions to save the day for the Four Roses brand.

3.0,"The nose is very good. Simple and sweet, vanilla pudding with faint notes of straw and wood. Very little ethanol. On the palate it enters with light vanilla and dusty oak. Not complex, but it is good. Even at 80 proof, it has a nice little kick on the finish. A reviewer on another site described it perfectly, ""light without being weak"". Ice or water doesn't enhance any flavors, it simply mutes them and does away with the kick on the finish. This has become my go-to 80 proofer."
3.0,"Part 1 of 4:
So last night I attended a Four Roses tasting here in Colorado Springs and was very impressed! Brent (master distiller of Four Roses) and his team put on a great evening of tasting four of their products! 
    
Color: The color in the glass was a tawny caramel.

Nose: The nose was not too crazy, but still really good. I got notes that contained oak, vanilla, caramel, and grass.

Taste: The palate was simple yet very enjoyable with honey and caramel notes with a smoothness I really enjoyed!

Finish: The finish was medium in length, had little to no burn, and was, for lack of a better word, refreshing!

Opinion: It was a simple bourbon but it was very tasty and I have no complaints with it! It would make a phenomenal go to bourbon for me personally as even my wife, who does not drink whiskey neat, tried it and said it tasted sweet and she liked it! Well done Four Roses! Sláinte!"

Spices and rye make this dram a great ingredient for cocktails. You can easily sip it neat once, twice, but not three times: it lacks of deeper notes, but actually we don't expect for them.
much better than Jack Daniels to me."

3.25,"I picked up a bottle of this for only $22 bucks last week at Meijer. I've tried Four Rose's single barrel before and I was a fan instantly. I'd heard good things from this house so I wanted to give it a try. 

At first scent it's a very pleasant nose, caramel & vanilla instantly.

At first sip it's very smooth, I get the vanilla and also a bit of honey. I was waiting for a little bit of alcohol burn, but there was absolutely none. The bourbon does come off light, but it's so darn pleasant on the palate who cares.

 At 2nd sip the bourbon comes off pretty straight forward , light with a very nice mouth. 

This is not a layered, complex bourbon. But you can tell the genius in this 80 proof bourbon by how pleasant it is to taste/sip. I could sip this one all day, job well done once again by Four Roses."

3.25,"I live in a rural area and sometimes I have to shop the limited selection they have in town. Today they were out of pretty much everything I like in the mid to upper price range, so I decided to pick up a bottle of (what used to be) yellow label. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy drinking this was. Vanilla, caramel, spice, but light with no ethanol burn. I wouldn't add water or ice as it would lose flavor. This is definitely something I wouldn't be afraid to serve guests, and I wouldn't get angry if they mixed it with soda."
3.0,"A couple months ago I decided to revisit some of the bottom shelf bourbons under $25. This is where most of us started, many of us graduate and move on to mid and top shelf selections where flavor complexity and nuances open our eyes to the ever developing world of this delightful golden amber spirit. 

So does that mean the bottom shelf doesn’t have anything of value or interest for those of us that are a bit more seasoned? On the contrary, hence this review. This Four Roses Bourbon (formerly known as Yellow Label) is their entry bourbon, it has a mixed mash bill and registers no age statement, the 80 proof will keep your socks firmly on your feet. I picked up a little vanilla on the nose but one thing I noticed is there wasn’t a heavy ethanol presence which so many bottom shelfers have.  The body for me was very smooth, sweet vanilla again and candy corn, and was there a little mint hiding in there? This is not complex at all in fact I found the flavor profile to be subtle, almost subdued. I didn’t (and wouldn’t) add water or ice, I’m afraid it would drown this one. I was a little surprised to find some ginger spice on the back end which was nice while it lasted. This is a very congenial easy drinking bourbon, meant for gatherings and friendly conversations, you’re not going to offend anyone with this. It’s a real good bottom shelf bourbon, I had honestly forgotten how smooth it was, no heat or harshness. I didn’t remember until now how much I enjoyed it, this is a solidly classic middle of the road bourbon."

3.75,"My 175th review. 

One of the staples that punches above its weight. Low-proof but rich in flavor and always dependable.  

Nose: vanilla, baking spices and hints of oak and honey (side note: *one or two* drops of water — and I emphasize one or two because that’s all you need to open up a little extra mint on the nose)

Palate: rye spice comes in here and adds
some extra bite not expected from an 80-proof whiskey 

Finish: medium, with smoothness not expected from a young, entry-level bourbon. Vanilla sweet returns here as well. 

One of the best $20-and-under bourbons you can buy, in my opinion."

Bottled at 40%abv, with a tawny color.

On the nose is the typical bourbonish note: caramel, flowers, wet plants, the typical grape bourbon profile but dim, sherry, grapes, slight banana.

On the palate, too much water were used to lower the abv to 40% on this one, and starts too ""watery"", to change into a vanilla, peppery flavor, not too exciting and very boring. Finish is very short with an ashy note.

Overall i give this one a 62 over a 100. Move along, Nothing here."

Finish: Lasting rye and baking spice with a dry rounded finish

Initially hot on the palate, this dram starts to round out as you let it develop. Rye and baking spice attack the nose and palate and eventually you’re greeted with a hint of cherries. Unfortunately, there’s nothing unique about this bourbon. The small batch and single barrel definitely have the upper hand."
