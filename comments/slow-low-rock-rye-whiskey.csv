3.0,"Very sweet, but not syrupy. The orange and bitters come through. This is close to an Old Fashion in a bottle, ready to drink."
4.0,Slow sipper with a sweet taste

3.75,This sweet and fruity and very unusual rye. The orange rock candy is strong. It is a cocktail in a bottle. Moderate finish for the low proof. Very little rye spice. Buy for the uniqueness and low price.

4.0,"Sweet and flavorful. A nice departure from just the grains of Scotch, Rye, or Bourbon."
3.0,Sweet and orangey/candy
3.0,"As said in other reviews it’s an old fashioned in a bottle, strong orange and bit of chocolate flavour with a weak rye backbone. It’s all right, crazy first taste if u can settle into the notion of a old fashioned as a straight whiskey it’s alright"
4.0,Definitely an Old Fashioned in a bottle. If you like orange you’ll love this. The orange rock candy easily comes thru. If you like sweet this fits the bill too. TEHO but for bottles under $30 this is easily a daily drinker.

3.5,This is more like a liqueur than a straight whiskey. Strong orange nose like a orange peel. Sweet flavors like grandmas hard candy. Rye is very subdued. This is not what I was expecting but I’ve been pleasantly surprised. It’s a good sipper and a unique bottle to have.
