Best Rye I have ever tasted. The story behind this bottle is:
Barrel bought 8 MGP barrels of 95/5 rye from a defunct distillery and stashed them away because they were so good. Years later they unearthed them and offered them to top clients. One barrel went to the Colorado rye and bourbon collectors...

Nose has some crisp apple and baking spices... almost like an apple pie. Vinegar, oak, caramel and dill finish it out.

Palate is caramel apples and dill pickles with an overtone of oak and baking spices.

Finish is incredibly long, dry, full of dill rye and has the warmth of barrel proof.

Best rye ever."
