4.0,"One of the better offerings from Corby Distillers, but if you can't abide sweetness, steer clear. You'd have a hard time finding another whiskey this good for the same price.

Sweet citrus fruit,  raisin and toffee give way to flares of Christmas spices, peppery heat and smooth vanilla."

3.0,"[This review is of the 10-year-old age stated Canadian version.] While Pike Creek is head and shoulders above the typical Canadian whisky, here's the problem: Canadian whisky as a style is already quite sweet, and port finishing tends to add sweetness, so what you've got here is sweet upon sweet with not enough rye character to really bring it back from the edge. Flavour is a cross between a typical Canadian and a port- or sherry-finished Scotch: vanilla, oak, holiday spice, a bit of rye and dill, some breadiness. Berries. Nuttiness, dark fruits and brown sugar. Not bad, but Alberta Premium Dark Horse pulls off the ""wine-finished Canadian whisky"" trick a lot better, and both Lot 40 and Wiser's Legacy are better exemplars than Pike Creek of the so-called ""new breed"" of Canadian whisky."

2.0,"Crap, sorry to say. Tastes like a worse version of crown royal. I didn't taste the port barrel aging, and I have had some excellent port finished whiskies. Don't waste your money, buy the cheaper Canadian whiskies out there for the same or better taste."

4.0,"Sweet richness of the Port barrels on the nose with the bold whiskey back suppoting it. Sweet wine and berry/fruity notes compliment the silky creaminess of this Canadian Whisky. Has a subtle warmth hitting the back of the tongue and top of the throat. Finishes dangerously smooth and rich as the dark grape notes of the port linger. Has a bourbon-esque playful, yet subtle, bite. Well worth experiencing."
4.0,Very smooth and easy drinking. Better than crown.

4.0,"Delicious and another great whisky from the same makers of Lot 40.  It's quite smooth, with the nose evoking port wine. There's cherry at the finish, though regretfully that finish is much too short."

2.0,A bit underwhelming.  Very short finish.
4.0,"I feel like I shouldn't enjoy this, but I do. There is a slight burn but the sweetness makes it very moorish."
3.0,"Nose is almost entirely rubbing alcohol with just a bit of fruit. Luckily the palate brings more to the party, with a creamy vanilla and round fruitiness. Moderately sweet, medium finish with the tiniest bit of salt as it lingers, which leaves you wanting the next sip. A splash of water dulls the astringent nose and smooths out the vanilla nicely. A nice one to add to the collection, but not a regular sipping whisky. Definitely going to try it in cocktails, should make a nice Manhattan."

4.0,Fruity and creamy with a bit of spice. Delicious.
3.0,"Very interesting and unique. Sweet port aroma of dried fruits. Lighter mouthfeel than expected but the flavors are nuanced and enjoyable. Sweet dried fruit, cherries and a very smooth moderately long finish. Not bad at all for mid $30s"

4.0,"All the looks of an unchilled Manhattan in the glass; deep dark caramel with shades of red when caught in the light. A nice old wood nose. Roasted pecans came to mind on the palate, as well as dark cocoa, descending into dried cherries on the finish. Slightly unctuous mouthfeel, with a satisfying spiciness that lingers, but doesn't overstay its welcome. For a $30 whiskey (in the U.S.) this is definitely worth collecting to diversidy a home bar, even if it is a little sweeter than what I, personally, seek out. Canadian Whiskey's image is still in stages of recovery, and hopefully whiskeys like this can improve upon the damage more well-known Canadian blends have inflicted upon the our perceptions of everything coming from our neighbors to the north."

3.0,"This should be a 4 star Canadian. This should be a full, rich, beautiful port-finished whisky abounding in berry and dried fruit character, with a hint of nuttiness and sweet vanilla. And, in fact, those things are there on the palate...which, at 40%, is so damn thin that it wastes what could be a outrageously good whisky for the price. I'd kill to have this at 46-48%. Really frustrating to be able to see the Promised Land of whisky perfection from here, but to be kept from crossing over the river."

2.0,"Nose: Wine and typical corn-whiskey aromas, and not much more. Maybe a hint of rye and oak. It's ... soft and inoffensive.

Palate: An uninspiring arrival with a little raisin and brown sugar, then turning sharply ginger-spiced and peppery in the development. Some sour bitterness like over-brewed tea that has been watered down, but also a sweetness around the tongue. Not completely unpleasant, but strangely out of step with itself.

Finish: Fairly short, with some metallic sugary flavours, but it is a crisp finish.

The nose is thin, but not bad, however the palate is not integrated. There is the spicy base of a fairly ordinary whisky in parallel with a thread of wine, but there is no collaboration happening. It’s like two actors on stage at the same time, but performing parts from different plays.

An “also ran” whiskey - perfectly drinkable and immediately forgettable - but wildly overpriced for what it is.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars"
