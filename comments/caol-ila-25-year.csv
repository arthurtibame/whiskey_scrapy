4.5,"Received this as a present from a bunch of mates which was a lovely surprise. Also surprising was the fact that despite it's age it retained the  classic Caol Ila flavour profile quite well, age having faded it slightly but smoothed off the rougher edges of its younger brothers. The Caol Ila moch we also tried on the night seemed very rough in comparison. Great drop at a reasonable price point for a 25 at  ~ $180 USD. Taking the price into consideration I'd put the 1/3rd less priced 18 yr ahead but very happy to have this as a present :-). Update: Now this has settled a while I rate this even more. Given it's one of the cheapest distillery 25 year distillery bottlings out there I'm rounding to a 4.5."

5.0,"oh me, oh my.  this is such a delightful little drop.  acquired mine in europe - its caol ila stock approach, with all the benefits you might expect from a bit more of a lie down.  is it worth the extra on the standard? by dram in a restaurant: possibly.  at the duty free: if you're bored and need a speaking piece.  that said: i have this, and i love it.  smokey, barley, smooth with long term wood character and a place in the afterlife."
5.0,"I've been avoiding this whisky for a while. I'm very fond of Caol Ila and was worried this wouldn't live up to my expectations. I'm happy to say it still surprised me.
  
  The nose has wet peat, malt vinegar, shoe polish, and dried heather. There's a lot happening on the palate. The texture is very juicy. Aggressive wood spices out of the gate, dry dark malt, waxy fruit, powdered white chocolate, and a subtle smoke and petrol finish. While this is fun to dig through, it seems more of a trip to whisky academia.  Luckily adding a few drops of water changes all of that. 
  The palate becomes pure silk and wonderful juicy fruit emerges from the malty palate. You sacrifice some complexity but it is a more than favorable exchange. 
  
  Well done Caol Ila."

5.0,"Day 17.  Caol Ila 25. This is probably the oldest whisky I have tried so far. I own a bottle of the 12 and tried the 18 in a bar. But by god, I have to get a bottle of the 25. The real kicker is, this is only 10 bucks more than the Kilchoman Port....and the contrast between those two....like a fishing boat vs the Yamato. 

The nose is very delicate peat, some salt and vanilla, and a very clear, distinct note of chocolate raspberries. I don't think I had that anywhere else before, and I'm in love with it. 

The taste is also amazing. A very soft yet still present peat layer, some salty vanilla fudge, a touch of honey sweetness, some herbal notes that I'd probably categorize as basil, and some pekan nuts. Very, very delicious. And it keeps changing with every sip. 

There is a long, slightly bitter, woody aftertaste with some smoke and nuttyness. 

I think this has just overtaken the Hibiki 17 and the Highland Park 18 as my favorite whisky so far. I'm in heaven. 

Caol Ila is very underrated in my opinion. The prices for these are just stunningly low, and they are so worth it."

4.75,"It’s in my top 2 because it transports you to another place and time...namely, an evening summer barbecue outside a fishing village. This Dram offers an Incredible balance of seaside salt, rich fruits, floral sweetness, and whispering peat. Truly a top notch Scotch whisky and happy to own a bottle. Top of the line Caol Ila"

4.75,"Excellent scotch, perfect. Smoky but its mellowed enough where it's a nice addition and not the focal point. Nice amount of sweetness and a great finish that lingers of peat."
4.75,"This immediately jumped close to the top of my list of not in the #1 spot. It’s not surprising since I love Islay, Caol Ila, and higher aged expressions. This one is a subtle peat but so expressive and complex. Beautiful!"

4.25,"I recently found bottles of this online out of the U.K. for around $110, so I went ahead and stocked up because that’s a fine price for such a well-aged whisky.  The only drawbacks I discovered initially were the fact that Diageo blends these down to 43% and they have added color to make each successive vintage as uniform as possible, color wise.  I believe they may also be chill-filtered- which begs the question:  why Diageo?  Why?

I recently opened a bottle of the 18 year, peated Caol Ila from 2008 and was utterly blown away.  The fact I had multiple bottles of the 25 really piqued my interest and I was dying to know if an additional 7 years in the cask just dialed things up to 11.  Spoiler:  it did not.

Onward, though, this quarter century Caol Ila is a beautiful, deep gold in the taster and appears oily, with thin legs and medium, teardrops on the rim.  This bottle was filled in 2007 at the aforementioned 43% ABV.  

The nose was typical Caol:  bbq smoke and sea spray.  Light tar and fruity chewing gum notes waft gently from the glass as you spin and get down in there.  Some apricot and citrus were coerced out after a lengthy wait.  Very nice.

The palate was again meaty smoke and salty, biting undertones.  This leaves the fruity notes of the 18 year old completely out of the mix.  It’s still oily and thick, even with the added water dilution, and theres very little barrel characteristics or vanilla sweetness.  It’s mostly soft and forgiving for a Caol Ila- evidence of the time in the oak.  These were probably refilled casks, I’m assuming.

The finish is medium to long, oily and smoky.  The salt cuts into the tongue and throat as it dries away and I can’t help but think it needs a healthy ABV kick.  The final wafts of smoke return as though you’ve extinguished a campfire and just stood overtop of it and inhaled the final fumes deeply.  It’s still quite satisfying.

Overall, it’s not the 18 year I just fell in love with, but it is still a fine example of a well-matured Islay whisky.  If you like your peated whisky with a seaside kick to go along with an impressive age statement- this is your whisky.  If you can find it for $111 like I did, well that’s like hitting the bonus on a Vegas slot machine.  You win twice.  4.25 stars with a bonus .25 for price and relative availability/attainability.  Cheers, my friends."
