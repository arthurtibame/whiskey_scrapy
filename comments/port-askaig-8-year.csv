I'm getting seashells and brine on the nose, followed by peat and fresh citrus fruits on the palette.  If I had to guess, I'd say this is a Caol Ila.  It's not as muscular as an Ardbeg or Lag, and lacks the band aid of the Laphroaig.  Caol Ila...putting my money on Caol Ila."

2.5,"Nose: the smoke is definitely not peaty, more like campfire but with a sweetness to it. Plaster, maybe?

Palate: very light body. The smoke notes are again like campfire but not aggressive, with a mild dry sweetness to it, likely from the port.

Finish: the campfire wood lingers for a moment without the sweetness."

2.5,"Ok, this dram highlights the difference, for me, between reading a theological treatise, and diving into the world of the Legend of Zelda. Both, for me, are recreational activities. But one, I do to engage my brain and grapple with heavy ideas, and the other, I do to escape into a fantasy world where sure, there are challenges, but for the most part, I’m relaxing. Irish whiskeys and non-Islay scotches are my happy place, my Hyrule. This scotch is G.K. Chesterton’s Orthodoxy. Meaty, in fact, I now understand what people mean when they say a whiskey reminds them of ham. I can taste ham in my dram. Definitely smoky, but smooth, and the campfire doesn’t linger super long. I’d call it a good “gateway Islay.” Enjoyable, but I still struggle with the genre."
4.25,"No doubt it’s an Islay on the nose. It’s got that typical dangerous Islay pale gold color, which you know is a lie, because rather than a romantic date with the glass, you’re about to get smacked across the face by a fire pit.

Much more flavorful than Lagavulin, as in, it actually has one. The subtleties are actually quite intriguing. The finish is smoky smooth, and you can definitely taste the peat. There’s also a bit of Sharpie thrown in there.

Overall, a new favorite in terms of Islay scotches. Definitely need to try some of the older brothers though."

2.25,"Mild peat, slight lingering, it’s okay"
4.0,"Difficult to explain the smokiness in this. Not medicine or full meat of other Islay options. This gave me a flashback to the fires of a village on the southern coast of Madagascar, cooking goat...something of the developing world."
3.0,"Nose: smoke, BBQ smoke, hickory smoke, iodine, citrus, bacon

Palate: smoke, great brine, vanilla, citrus, burnt caramel, cured meat, malty 

Finish: vanilla, peat smoke, pepper"
3.75,Pale color. Smoke and brine on the nose. Oily and creamy mouthfeel. Vanilla and smoke flavors dominant to me. Long smoky finish with some slight pepper. Pretty good.
4.5,Sweet with smokey flavor that lingers.
3.0,"Young.  On the nose iodine, ash, briny and a little lemon.  On the palate a little zest, ash and the finish is long with more ash, smokiness, but not like you will get in Ardbeg or Laphroaig, less intense."
4.0,I want to meet the moron that rated this 83.  This is probably the most underrated Islay I’ve ever had.

5.0,Salty and smoky of course. But also limey and peppery and sort of floral. Like if laphroaig and bunny teamed up and made lemonade

1.0,Did not enjoy. Astringent and peaty which is not my thing. High smoke and sweetness.

3.25,"Initial nose was paint thinner, but opened up with a bit of water and changed to more of a smokey iodine smell. Body is full of spice with a bit of lemon. Very spicy finish with a nice heat that's not too overwhelming. Was expecting more harshness for an 8. (Advent calendar day 4.)"

3.25,"Smoky and peaty. Young. Slight sweetness when the smoke subsides. Good nose, a bit harsh on the front of your tongue. Nice warmth. Reminds me of lagavulin 8 yr."
3.75,Peaty with a little bite. Ashy. Good dram for a cold day. Not much color. Very tasty.
3.5,"Smells of peat salt, tastes caramel peat little burn pepper at the end"
3.75,"Smokey, Medicinal and lemon on the nose. Spicey taste of grass, but also sweet. Easy drinking for a young Islay."
3.25,"Thin and young, but I like the balance of smoke and sweetness."
3.5,"Nose is lemon, sea salt and smoke

Palate is sweet and cloying with plenty smoke

Finish is medium with spice and yet more smoke

The youth of the spirit is perceptible as is the ABV but as an Islay it would be a good starter as it’s not overly pungent or oily."
