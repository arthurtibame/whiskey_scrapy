3.0,"Finally opened up my little 3cl sample I got ages ago from Master of Malt, when they were still shipping to the US.  

Kavalan has quickly made a name for themselves.  They put out single casks that can be amazing and pricey, or decent and pricey.  All quite young relative to UK standards, but that tropical heat smoothes out the youth.  

This one here is comes in at a hefty 55+ABV, and an even heftier price tag of about $230USD/ bottle.  The first thing you notice is the color—-that virgin oak really imparts the same color as bourbon.  Deep mahogany.  But the similarities to bourbon don’t stop there.  Sweet vanilla aroma.  Woody, oaky, ginger...more vanilla on the taste.  

Not my style, but I can see fans of CS style bourbon loving this."
