5.0,Very flavorful easy drinker.  I like this neat and cold.  I don't want ice to melt and water it down so I keep it in the freezer and let it open up slowly as I sip .  I get hints of coco on the nose. On the palette I find coco and caramel. There are also notes of oak and spices with a dry finish.
5.0,This is my go to cheap single malt whiskey. Very good and smooth. Definitely recommend
4.0,"Nose is soft and soapy, with hints of heather followed immediately by a blast of fruit. Palate backs up the nose, being soft and creamy, with fruit once again being the dominant flavor.  Hints of vanilla and honey come and go, leading to a very slight alcohol drying and a little taste of brown sugar and caramel.  The finish is short and again very, very sweet.  Overall, this is a very drinkable whisky with  good body and light, sweet flavors.

Tasted as a series, with Jameson Black Barrel, Jameson 12yr, Redbreast 12yr and Green Spot.  Ranking based on flavor from best to worst is Jameson 12yr, Tyrconnell, Redbreast 12yr, Jameson Black Barrel, and Green Spot.  When value is factored in, the rank order is Jameson 12yr, Tyrconnell Single Malt, Jameson Black Barrel, Green Spot and Redbreast 12yr."

4.0,"[Revisited 12/12/16]: It's been quite some time since I last spoke about this dram, but I'll save the sentiments.  Smooth, grassy, oily, touch of honey, and rich in super overripe banana.  Unfortunately there is a nasty burnt oak/old leather aftertaste that sticks around longer than the flavor does, and over the years I've become repelled by the sticky sweetness.  I would still say to give it a go to see how it matches up with the traditional 30$ Irish fair to see which direction your whiskey adventures will take you next.  For now, I'm done with this expression."

3.0,"With St. Patricks Day just around the corner, Irish is on the palate.  My bottle, tucked in the back of the cabinet, made it to the outside.  After a fair amount of time, the nose of tropical fruits: coconut, pineapple are strong.  Cereal  and honey notes float in the background.  The blend of aromas are tough to discern and create a funky mix.  Light body delivers a wave of the sweet tropical fruits and rapidly give way to grains, oak and pepper spice.  The  body is short-lived, however the finish is long leaves the mouth dry and spicy with trace amounts of pineapple.  Time enhances the sweetness drawing and a bit of patience makes this a better dram.  Somewhat atypical of Irish whiskies I have experienced.  Easy to sip and even-keeled.  Not over the top in sweetness or spice.  That, however, can leave the experience safe and unadventurous.  For an Irish whiskey, it's  enjoyable and easy and slightly unique.  [85/100][Opened: 2/21/16]"

Eaten after mild curry and taken with a few drops of water.
Taste: caramelised banana is what strikes me most. 2.5 stars

Second taste after Powers Johns Lane. No water. Light, fruity nose. Easy but unremarkable taste. May be worth bumping to a 3 but will wait until next taste. In any case, not one to invest in.

Third taste after a West Cork 10 year old single malt, which I preferred over this.  Not better than a 3 and probably 2.5 stars is where it rests."

3.0,"Cooley Distillery revived the historic brand of Tyrconnell in 1988, so let's give this classic Irish Single Malt a try! Simple presentation, no age statement - but at least it's affordable. The nose is clean and a bit anemic with green apple, citrus fruits and a touch of aniseed. Not as 'green' as I expected. On the palate, you get fresh and fruity notes, porridge and sweet hints of melon. Oddly enough, I detected distant bonfire smoke. Without any obvious cask influence, the finish is malty, sugary and slightly dry. An easy, understated and rather uneventful whiskey.

4.0,"And now for something completely different than your usual Irish profile, probably thanks to the lack of unmalted, pure potstill notes. A slightly timid nose gives up  vanilla pudding, caramel, candied orange peel and lemon, and a slight hint of spice. The palate is a unique experience, opening with those sweet notes but quickly yielding to a savory, meaty malt profile. The finish is a little short, but it's a pleasant dram...and a nice reprieve from the usual interchangeable Irish whiskies."

3.5,"Think about this in the realm of Irish Single Malts with my rating. Not the entire world of SMs. That rating would be around a 3 - 3.25 in terms of Character and profile.

N: Sweet/honeyed with white fruits and bright,citrusy orange notes with slight hints of milk chocolate 

P: Sweet, if not candied fruits and nougat start with rich orange peel toward the back

F: medium length, milk chocolate, sweet and fruity, creamy as it ends

I lives this for the price. Especially for those wanting an inexpensive SM not from Scotland. Could easily using in a cocktail. I'll typically drink neat in glencairn."

2.75,"I've never had an Irish single malt and NC decided to not sell this anymore, so I picked it up over more well-regarded single malts. It has been disappointing. There is negligible difference between this and a Scotch single malt, which I should've expected. The nose is pleasant enough, that sweet bready smell you get with a lot of Irish whiskey. The taste starts out fine, but the finish is not good. It dries the palate almost immediately and it is not enjoyable to keep sipping. I always struggle with this when I pour >1.0 oz, which is why I've had it open for 3 months. I need to try the Bushmills or Tullamore single malts to see if this is an Irish outlier."

3.25,"I go back and forth on this one.  Some days it seems like a great whiskey for the price, other days it strikes me as a little unusual.  When compared side by side with other Irish whiskeys (e.g. Jameson’s Black Barrel, Bushmills 10, Writer’s Tears), this one tastes the most different.  The nose has a strong cerealness.  On the tongue it has the signature Irish whiskey sweetness, but again a strong cereal taste.  For $35 a bottle, it’s a pretty decent dram, but at the end of the day, not my favorite.  Of the whiskey’s I’ve mentioned, probably tied for third with Jameson’s Black Barrel."

4.25,Day whiskey. Single Malt elegance. A campfire staple.
2.0,"Nose: Spirity to begin with, fresh and clean but also thin and weak. Rather like the nose of a close-to-bottom-shelf blended scotch. Malt, green apple, lemon zest with grassy spice notes in the background. The dry-glass aroma is all honey, surprisingly, but after several tastes I can't detect honey on the nose itself.

Palate: Fruity and spicy on the arrival with cereal flavours reminiscent of white bread toast. Porridge and malt come to dominate as it develops but there is an overarching gingery spicy note throughout the palate and an accompanying touch of aniseed. The texture is on the thin side.

Finish: Short. Malt flavours that are initially sweet and spicy but turn dry and almost bitter in the aftertaste.

An uninspiring Irish single malt that compares poorly against considerably cheaper scotch blends. There is just not enough going on here to make this worthy of compliment, and I'd equate it with something like Johnnie Walker Red Label - not actively bad, but you can do way better. It's not really satisfying as a sipping whisky and as a mixer it tends to disappear. It works best straight with a couple of rocks and a dash of soda water.

My biggest complaint is that this is very poor value for money. In Australia a bottle costs a couple of dollars less than Ardbeg 10. My cheap blended scotch of choice recently has been Ballantine's 12 year old, which is almost half the price but knocks this milquetoast contender onto the canvas with one punch. It's acceptable, with no real off-notes, but hardly recommended. The official rating here is about 10 points too high.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars"
4.0,"Nice golden color on the pour. Nose is faint vanilla and cereal with a whiff of alcohol. Thick mouthfeel. Cereal, vanilla, dark chocolate and just a tinge of alcohol on the palate. Medium-long finish with slight heat on the way down. Definitely more robust but also a little rougher than other Irish whiskies due to double distillation. Overall good for the price, especially if you like the stronger flavors more often found in Scotch."
