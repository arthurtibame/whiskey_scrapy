3.0,"Cor: ouro
Oleoso
Aroma: peaty Salgado, suave, doce
Início: pouco picante, muito agradável 
Sabor: perde o peaty. Começa com salgado leve, passa pra doce e tem um gosto final amargo. Difícil identificar um sabor predominante. Como é ""ralo"", fica entre o suave e a falta de personalidade; mas é muito fácil de beber e bom

3.0,"Really smoky on the nose, nothing else. Surprisingly fruity in the mid palate, touch of sweetness. Immediately back to a ton of peat smoke on the finish, and it lingers."

2.5,"Fine at the beginning, big Peat at the end after the swallow."
4.0,"The peated smell, a taste that comes from the ground, is very intense, giving a sense of austerity. It also brings some senses of familiar and closeness. Then ruffled on the nose is a little bit smell of gasoline and menthol. Finish with the smoky faintness, plus the salty taste of sweat. Smell of herbal and vanilla aroma when exhalating."

4.25,"This is no Glenfiddich. This is Talisker Skye.

Bottled at 40%abv, with a deep copper color.

On the nose it is Talisker Skye. On the palate is Talisker Skye. 

Lol

Really, i love talisker skye and i can recognize it in a blind taste. And this Glenfiddich Vintage reserve cask, was the expensiest of 3 new ""reserve cask"" series for the travel retail market, and has no trace of a Glenfiddich or a Speyside whatsoever. 

On the nose all those Island aromas: Salt, Smoke, peat, burnt rubber and seaweed. 

On the palate: salt, rubber, burnt meat, cough syrup, with a nedium finish. Full bodied. 

Overall it is a great talisker skye, but talisker skye cost half the price, so pick that one up, since it is the same thing. 89/100"
3.25,"Interesting attempt at a peated whiskey by Glenfiddich.. first i've had from them. To be honest I didn't even notice the peat it just tasted odd muddled off oak with vanilla, then i read the profile and thought oh yeah makes sense. It almost results in a dram that tastes like a dram it's been open to long. Not great but not bad."
