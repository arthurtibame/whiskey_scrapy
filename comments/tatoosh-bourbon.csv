1.75,"Pass... hard pass!!! Void of any complexity or enjoyable flavor, which is likely a result of its cut to 80 proof. Not trying to be overly harsh, but this tastes cheap, under-developed and belongs in a cheap cocktail or the trash can. 

On a side note, if your aim is anything less than 90 proof, bourbon probably isn’t your thing."
3.75,Just a hint of smokiness with sweet vanilla/chocolate after tones

4.0,"I found Tatoosh Bourbon, Rye and Scotch brands on a Holland American Cruise from Vancouver to Alaska and fell in love with them. Tatoosh Distillery: Trying the Bourbon, 80 proof, first which has very subtle flavors of corn & oak, sweet dark cherries and vanilla. It has a soft and smooth warm light finish. 
The Rye, 86 proof, the mix is 70% rye and 30% corn! which cuts the rye flavor. Still having a very pronounced rye taste. This will become a staple in my bar. 
The scotch, 80 proof, I am not a scotch drinker but this seems to have a taste demanding of a scotch, but much less harsh. 
As luck would have it, I met one of the owners on board the ship, conducting a little training with the ships bartenders. The distillery is located in Seattle, Washington But the product is not currently available in my home state of SC, with GA being the closest. Please give this a try when you find it."
