3.75,"Nose: fresh oak, grass or similar fresh plants, a bit of campfire and ending with the tawny port sweetness.

Palate: the oak notes shines first but the tawny port adds a smooth sweetness that mixes vanilla and caramel with some bitter earthy notes.

This whiskey has a lot of interesting notes going for it that I have never experienced together in a dram, and I'm having a hard time pinning a discription to them. But I would definitely recommend this to others."
