3.25,Not overly complex the fruity notes are pleasant. Initially sweet then the spice hits. Not bad at all on the rocks. Nothing special here but you cant beat price of $28 for a 1.75L This stuff is always good to have for backup and for sharing whenever your friends that drink too much come over.
2.75,"Perfect for using in cocktails for all of your vodka-loving friends. Certainly will not offend and may even get them curious about those “brown liquors.”  Consumed neat, it’s for intoxication and not for complexity and memorable flavors."
3.0,"Smooth, but I don’t get a ton of flavor from it."
3.0,Spice and Caramel. Easy Drinking
3.25,started pretty basic but brought out the spice in candied ginger

2.0,"It has a nutty fruitiness to it on the nose. Very mellow and hints of citrus with, strangely, a bit of roasted marshmallow. The nose is nice. As most Canadian whiskeys, the palate is very mellow, slightly sweet with almond. Its certainly not complex and gets boring after your first few sips."

3.0,"Surprising ly not bad in my hunt for bottom shelf bliss to save money.  The nose is harsh, and burns the hairs out of your nose, but then the vanilla scent comes out.  Wasn't anything special when tried neat, but on ice it seemed to sweeten up a bit and there was some caramel type taste."
3.5,The 12 year is better but this is good stuff smooth great flavor.
2.0,"Nose: leather, cinnamon, spicecake.
  Palate: a little watery...cherry...and a spiciness that lingers on the finish.
  Water balances the nose nicely, makes the palate sweet and a little spicier.
  Overall: not a bad value, but not bold enough for my tastes. For only a few bucks more I recommend Canadian Club’s “Classic 12” expression."
