4.0,Very drinkable even for those who are new to whiskey.  Sweet with some fruit notes like apricot and orange peel.  It is also excellent in an old fashioned.  Unique and tasty whiskey.  Met the distiller at a tasting prior to seeing Metallica play.

4.25,"This whiskey is much like Metallica themselves, brash, harsh and loud and making no excuses for it. Right up front you get kicked in the face by blackened oak, with a hint of sweetness from the brandy, probably prominent because of the noise process used. But then it mellows out like the Unforgiven and leaves you lingering in a long smooth finish."

1.5,"Bought a round of it for my friends and I to try it at a whiskey bar before I go out a buy a bottle... Not good.  I understand it was aged in black brandy casks, but it’s like the whiskey got the worst parts of the whiskey and brandy.  My friends who are not big into whiskey absolutely hated it."

4.0,Mixed review... I have 3 bottles (due to going to the v.i.p.) from the same batch (089) and the first bottle was a 5 star for me. Hints of wanting vanilla with it. That’s the reaction I had with every sip!!! Now the second bottle is not the same flavor... more of a straight vodka burn after sipping. Not sure if I want to open the third bottle for it may be a collectors type thing lol.
3.5,"Good, smooth, easy drinking whiskey. Lots of apple pie notes and vanilla. I think any whiskey drinker could appreciate a pour of this. However it’s forgettable and I don’t often find myself reaching for the bottle."
3.25,Batch 089. Not the biggest fan of the brandy notes

3.5,"Nose: musty fruits, candy hearts, barrel char, slight baking spices, vanilla.

Taste: wood, sour fruit, and a muddling of the nose notes. 

More:  I really wanted to love this whiskey. But it's sort of a mess. Are there interesting notes there? Yes. But they are so muddled together and messy it's hard to pick it apart.  In general this whiskey feels like a rushed product. They wanted it in a year so they rushed the sourcing, rushed the ""aging"" and came out with a rushed product. 
I love Dave Pickerel, I love a lot of what he did. I don't love this whiskey. Is it bad? No... Is it good? Maybe... Do I love it? No. I am glad it is at a fair price point."

3.25,"The nose leads into tough whiskey, like rye and bourbon, but then you can smell some sweetness, likely from the brandy. The taste is mellow and a tad harsh at the same time, and is kind of like a choose your own adventure; swallow it without air and you get a heated, smooth finish, but inhale after the finish, and all of a sudden a sweet, friendly whiskey appears."

3.75,"Wonderful nose, some grain with a distinct grape/cognac scent. Honey color in the glass. No burn up front, only hits on the back but it’s an oaky burn, love it. At first tastes like it doesn’t want You to taste it, then it opens up into light smoke and grape back end. Medium finish is drying with oak tannins leaving a lingering grape note with no smoke. Easy drinker that smells more complex than it is perhaps, but still a very nice everyday whiskey."

We're off to never-never land.... with this whiskey review.

Actually a pretty nice dram. Metallica's Blackened is not your average ""celebrity whiskey"", it is a well crafted, delicious pour.

It has been matured in Black Brandy Casks, (i googled it, there is no such thing as ""black brandy"") and then, and this is a fact, the distillers put speakers next to the barrels and threw Metallica's Rock to them. The idea was to make the powerful sound to interact with the cask, stirring it. Actually each batch has it's own setlist, mine was the 085 batch, whose songlist was picked by the bass player, Robert Trujillo. (Not one of the songs is popular, blame it on the bass player).

Ok. Lets review the spirit. 

Bottled at 45%abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose, very attractive: the most refined caramel. Almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts. Some dim herbal note. Flowers, perfumed. Varnish, dark chocolate, vanilla and lots of Brown sugar. Molasses. Humidity, cloth softener. Nice. Complex.

On the palate: acid prunes. Tobacco, chocolate, pepper spice, charcoal, a refined spiciness. Molasses, Rum and Cane flavor. Aftertaste is smoky, ashy and it has hints of rum. Very sugary.

Overall i believe this is a very nice dram, it almost made it to a 4.5 score, the bottle is beautiful, the whiskey is good, the story behind it is even better. My score for this is 89/100 and i don't believe you can get any better for the price. Go buy it. Rock On."
3.0,"Slight citrus on the nose, some clove honey, furniture polish, musk, and cologne. A young note as well... which fortunately isn't heavy on the palate. It's there but doesn't dominate. Smooth, mild sweetness, slightly floral, some turpentine, with a nutty and funky note at the end that probably came from the brandy barrels. Ends spicy, with some bitterness. One of the better new products released recently. 4/7/2020"

3.0,Unique with well-balanced cognac and whiskey notes. Aroma is sweet and the grapey brandy notes are readily apparent with the whiskey notes coming through on the lighter side; Palate is a bit darker with more of the dark sweetness coming through along the lines of brown sugar and molasses with the whiskey notes kicking up heavily right before the finish; Finish starts out as cognac and moves to whiskey then fades sweet and butterscotchy.

Nose; light honey with spice and a touch of citrus, perfect amount of oak with a dab of almond, initial burn that lingers then buries with a nice warm strong spicy apricot smokey finish.  Very nice, gets better the more time you spend with it.  Very light legs with Carmel tones.  50-75 price point."

3.0,"Catching up on some reviews during my vacation in the picturesque city of Lake Tahoe! This is another Whiskey that has not yet hit the AZ market but is readily available in a lot of markets. It's a collaboration between Metallica and the late great Dave Pickerell of Maker's Mark and Whistlepig Fame. 

It's pretty interesting as it's a blend of Bourbon, Rye and ""other"" Whiskey ratios are undisclosed. It's then finished black Brandy Casks where they use sonic enhancement to agitate the barrels. They do this by blasting Metallica! Quite the process!

The results are actually much more structured then I expected. It's undoubtedly well constructed and a pleasant sipper. It's very sweet and grapey so the finishing is pronounced. You also get some apple and bitter young wood with slight spice. 

So for me this is undoubtedly a blend of young Whiskey where the finishing does a pretty good job of masking the youth. Not really something I personally would want to spend $50 on but worth a pour because it is really unique. For those who enjoy a sweet Whiskey, you may enjoy this much more than I did! Cheers all!"
