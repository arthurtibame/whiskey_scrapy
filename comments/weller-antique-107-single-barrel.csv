I know I got Apricot and apple pie but will update once it breaths. Some notes I’ve never had for sure"

4.0,"Single barrel pick from Downtown Liquor in Eugene, Oregon.  Butterscotch, corn and a hint of pear/pineapple on the nose. Very oily and oaky on first taste. The oil coats your tongue. On second taste, the oiliness is lessened and some spice comes through.
Third taste is more buttery. A drop or two of water gives it an additional aroma of wine while also adding some fruitiness to the flavor profile. This particular barrel is oilier, dryer and less alcohol-forward than previous Weller 107 blended-barrel bottles I’ve sampled."
4.5,"Nose - Oak, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, caramel and a touch of honey and cinnamon. 

Palate - Mild notes of pepper on top of vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, oak and baking spices, and a hint of honey 

Finish - Medium length with fading baking spices, oak and vanilla."
4.0,"Berries, cherries, baked goods buttery, can smell the heat. Tongue coating. Caramel. The best cough syrup ive ever had haha. The finish is a little too syrupy. Really good otherwise."

4.25,"For National Bourbon Day I fell on some good fortune in finding a Bourbon that I have literally not seen in the wild in AZ for 3+ yrs! And it's a single barrel to boot! I was able to purchase it from the most unlikely of places, my local cigar bar (yes the same one I have referenced in multiple reviews that is in the same strip mall as my barber!) I always stop by to check out if they have any special drams  and they did indeed. Pappy was back ($50 for 1oz of the 15 🤮) and Elmer T Lee ($12 for 1.5oz). I then notice they have Weller Antique back and it has the single barrel sticker ($20 for 1.5oz). After looking those over I actually decided to pull the trigger on a malt I have heard a lot of good things about the Aberlour A'bundah (review forthcoming). After enjoying that one as I am about to pay is ask if they would be willing to sell me one of their Weller Antique's as it's a private barrel (they have sold me bottles in the past). He said sure! Now at this point I was waiting for a price north of $100 which I would have passed on but to my surprise he said $50!! For a Weller Antique Single Barrel that is impossible to find in my market it was a no brainer! Especially with the fact that BT just raised the SRP on the batch product to $49.99. Let's dive into the review to see if it's actually good:
Upon entry it's a lovely velvety mouth feel bursting with butterscotch, burnt brown sugar, dried berries and barrel char. Oak leads the mid palette with the addition of honey and a dash of cinnamon. Medium finish with more oak, toffee and barrel spice. Compared to the batch product this was much smoother and had no detectable heat. Much easier to drink but also a tad lighter on the oak notes. For my preference it's much better than the batch product! 
These Barrels tend to be around 7 years old and with that age you don't get the leather or tobacco notes that you get on spades with the Weller 12. However, I actually think I prefer this to the 12 overall. I have been really tucking into the store picks recently and find consistently they are amongst the best buys in Bourbon!
So while this is a superior dram for sure it's not quite in the 4.5+ territory as it's lack of age does limit the complexity of it and the finish doesn't quite live up to the rest of the experience. That said it's an awesome Whiskey that I am very happy to have finally found as a single barrel for non secondary pricing. 
Barrel # 39 picked by Fox Cigar Bar. 
Cheers all!"

3.75,"Calvert Woodley Single Barrel Select purchased at Calvert Woodley DC on 6/13/19 for National Bourbon Day.  All Wellers have a very limited allotment in Virginia, so I just thought I was  paying a hefty premium to get the regular Antique 107 in DC that I can never find and have never tried; once at home I realized this was a special bottle indeed.  I am a big wheated bourbon fan, and have really enjoyed both ends of the Weller spectrum, so anticipation is sky high.  

Poured neat into a Glencairn at home.   Nose has tons of caramel, with oak and vanilla, mild apples, definite heat coming through.  Taste is oak and vanilla with spice coming on strong.  A dash of water opens it up, letting the sweeter caramel peak through.  Overall much more spice and heat punch than I expected.  I like this, but my expectations were not met.  I wanted to be wowed, and I just am not.  This is not the smooth operator I had hoped for.  Good, perhaps very good, but not great.  6/13/19"

Smoother and easier to drink than the batch 107. Notes of brown sugar, berry/cherry, oak, and cinnamon come through with little to no burn. Very good bourbon."

3.5,"2018 Jack Rose Saloon edition. Neat in a Glencairn at Jack Rose in DC.  Nose is complex: sour apple, hint of acetone, brett, bubblegum.  Interesting.  Taste is grains with some spice. Mild heat.  Lingering spice on the finish. Ok, but frankly another disappointment for the 107 single barrel.  I think the original is just not improved upon when these stores and bars mess with it.  7/4/19"

3.0,Actually tasted a single barrel 16 pick.  Like this less than non-CBC pick.
4.25,"Weller Antique 107 (All-star Liquors SP):

Nose- cinnamon, cherries, caramel, brown sugar, honey, apples

Palate- cinnamon hard candies, spiced vanilla, cinnamon-sugar covered apples, caramel, bit of bubble gum 

Finish- Medium, spicy finish with notes of cinnamon and sweets

Initially wasn’t a huge fan of this bottle. After about a month it opened up into something great. Nose is good, palate is better- with a medium finish that last a good while and a good amount of complexity to it."

4.0,"Two weeks since I’ve had a proper pour —might as well make it count by having a rather hard to come by Weller 107 store pick.  I don’t think I’ve had a Weller before, or for that matter maybe even a wheated bourbon.  

For 107 proof, this is quite smooth and silky.  I’m really not the feeling the heat as I should.  It’s also sweeter than most bourbons I’ve had; cinnamon roll and oak on the palette, with a long vanillin finish.  For $50, this is a no-brainer buy.  

Thanks to @dubz480 for this generous sample!"

4.0,"Neat. Z&Z. Great first impression on the neck pour.  Deep and rich flavors. Hit of oak transitions to apples, vanilla and honey.  Little baking spice.  There is something interesting about this nose.  Started out rich and dark initially but it’s so overwhelmingly light and bright now.

Way different than expected on the taste too.  The SiB is so different.  Brown sugar and apples on the tongue.  Transitions to the caramels and oak I more associate with Antique.  Legs are vanilla and apple again.

Dries out the mouth tremendously and quite a bit of alcohol burn lingers and builds on the legs.  

I was excited about trying a SiB Weller Antique. This experience was good but spiky.  I’ll try again once it opens up but this pour is just good, not great."
