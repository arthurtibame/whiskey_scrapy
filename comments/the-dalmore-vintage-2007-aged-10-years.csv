4.0,"Sherry, Smoke, sweet"
2.5,"Every 10 thousand years, when the sun places itself in the middle of the galaxy you get to taste..... A bad Dalmore. 

Bottled at 46%abv, this is a 10yo dram, with a vintage year: 2004. 

And its horrible. 

Dalmore is known for its sherriness, but it seems this whisky has only been matured in ex bourbon barrels. 

On the nose: Milk, Herbal liquorice note,
Hanuta, Hazelnut, Orange caramel. Not bad at all.

On the palate: Chili. Almonds. Acetone.

Way too spicy chili and wasabi.
This is not dalmore. This is not sherry. Not enjoyable. 

Aftertaste is not pleasant. Hot oak. Spicy chilli. Way to spicy. Off-putting. 

Overall this is a total disaster, specially for a Dalmore. This is the exception to the rule, 56 over 100. Avoid it."
