2.0,"One day, when I retire, one of the bucket list items I have is to drive across this great beautiful nation of ours and visit every major distillery in each state.  But, until that time comes, I’ll have to be content in trying samples from various ones as I find them.  This one was sent to me by @jonwilkinson7309 ( thanks Jon!).  

Virginia isn’t up there in the distilling scene like Colorado, New York, or California,  and they’re probably known more for their craft beer than whiskey.  But I’m glad to see this one, although technically they’ve been sourcing from Scotland while they produce and age theirs I think.  This particular one is a limited version, age unknown ( but I’m guessing young), with a 8-12 month rum cask finish.  I’ve not had many rum cask finishes, but the ones I did have, I wasn’t a fan ( Balvenie and Glenfiddich come to mind).  Personally, I found the rum casks overly sweet or not doing much to the base spirit.  I’m finding the similar situation here :
Nose is a bit sharp.  You know it’s young and can benefit some time more in the barrel.  
Taste...not getting rum.  More of a bread-y malty taste, some sharpness towards the end.  Youth is so evident in this...thinking something else besides rum would’ve helped cover the age ( sherry?  Red wine?) 

Interesting, but if you like rum finishes ( I don’t personally), try the Balvenie Caribbean cask instead.  It comes with an age statement (14yr), and similar price point ($60)."
2.75,"I found a barrel pick of Virginia Distillery Company's Rum Cask Finish at small (but very solid) Redstone Liquors in Andover MA.  I decided to go for it despite not finding a single review available online.

Like the other editions of VDC's Virginia-Highland series this is a mix of a malt whisky produced by VDC in Virginia with malt whisky from the Highlands of Scotland.  It's bottled at 46% ABV.

The nose, while not particularly strong, has cereal notes, a bit of citrus and lemon, and an overall sweetness that makes me think of confectioners sugar.  

The palate starts somewhat watery (surprising for 46% ABV) before a mix of vegetal and grassy notes, some citrus, and wood spices take over.  The finish is long, with grapefruit, oak, and a slow build of ethenol.  

The rum barrel finish comes through in the sweetness on the nose, but largely disappears on the palate.  Unfortunately, what's left is a Highland-style malt that's not among the better ones I've tried.  Ultimately, it's somewhat dry and not particularly sweet, which is not what I desire in  a rum cask finished whisky.  

I love the fact that VDC is flying the American malt whisky flag, so I really wanted to like this dram (also, because I spent 60 bucks on it).  But if you're looking for a rum finished single malt, I'd recommend the Balvenie Carribean Cask above the VDC.   If you're generally curious about VDC, I'd recommend trying their port cask finished whisky instead."
