3.0,"The fortified wine barrels definitely give it a sweet and full flavour, but it just lacks complexity."
4.0,July 13th at Central City pub in Surrey BC. Very Similar to the basic LMCC product reviewed elsewhere.  The wine barrel finish gives a bit of extra sparkle. Nice!
3.25,"The youngness of this malt is the most apparent of Lohin McKinnon's whiskys. It's fairly ethanol forward, which is unfortunate because it has some really interesting earthy and wine tannin flavours. It just didn't hold up so well against the lovely luscious texture of their other malts in a flight."
