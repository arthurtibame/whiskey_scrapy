4.0,"Apple cinnamon cheerios perfectly describes this.  I had this over the weekend, as a bit of a departure from my weekend pour of ""traditional"" whiskey.   The minute I opened the bottle, I got this funky combination of shoe polish, apples, and pumpernickel rye.  I'm not a huge fan of this aroma, but it's not off-putting...just a personal taste of not liking shoe polish smell.  Maybe something to do with me working in a shoe store as a teen stacking boxes.  Taste is spot on apple cinnamon cheerio.   I loved Wyoming Whiskey's standard bottle, maybe because the first time I had it was in Jackson Hole overlooking the Grand Tetons, so I'm sure the environment had something to do with it.  This one...I'm not so sure.  Given that it's approximately the same price as their standard, I'd choose the standard.  But, if you LOVE apple cinnamon cheerios, then by all means, this is an absolute must-have purchase.  Otherwise...pass.  Tried again this eve 4/9:  makes a huge difference if you let it breathe for a bit, and add a cube of ice.  The rye then becomes really well balanced with the bourbon.  The bourbon brings out the sweetness to the rye's brashness.  Really liking the output of this craft distillery; my new favorite after High West"

3.0,"This is a very well integrated blend that sits  somewhere between HIgh West’s Bourye and Campfire. It’s more rye-centric than the former and lacks the smokey finish of the latter, but it’s a worthy rival with a distinct taste."

2.0,Rye spice. Not much else. No need to buy a full bottle.

4.0,"Friday the thirteenth and in the mood for a non-scotch brown liquid.  Fumble, fumble and I find this sample. 


Immediately on the nose are apples with cinnamon. In short time, other quality high rye whiskey notes  come through: cloves,  leather, rye, brown sugar, vanilla. Some oak char as well.  In due time, however, the aromas crescendo and start slow fade, becoming weaker in potency.  Still, though, quite nice. 

For it’s high proof, the palate  arrives soft and sweet in a medium dense body. Richly deep with brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon. The rye notes are detectable but not overpowering.  Fairly straight forward, but tasty. 

The finish is long and enjoyable. Oak and cinnamon that is drying.  Some root beer on the far reaches. 

This hybrid bourbon-rye provides a whiskey that is a good sipper. Similar, from recollection, of Four Roses Single Barrel.  Sweet for a rye; spicy for a bourbon. Thanks @PBMichiganWolverine for the sample that had made a journey to New York, Virginia and back again. [87/100][Tasted: 7/13/18]"
4.0,"spicy rye comes through up front. not sweet, but floral vanilla oak and then dry finish. nice rye to sip, but pricey for the competition out there."

4.5,"I am really enjoying this random liquor store purchase. This is as close to EH Taylor as I have ever tasted. BiB & wheated to just the right smoothness. The rye is amazing, and the Apple cinnamon Caramel & a very nice double oak flavor are all followed by an amazing oily mouthfeel. Definitely worth picking up a bottle, IF you can find it."

3.75,"A little spicy but not overwhelming. Rye on the back, bourbon on the front."
4.25,"Originally smelled aggressive and abrasive taste mirrors smell. After adding an ice cube to modify the barrel strength, the whiskey opened up dramatically, it's now sweet with a healthy amount of smoke."
3.0,very smooth finish. Great level of sweetness with good body.

null,Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. Good balance of fruitiness and spiciness.
5.0,Nose is light. Nice vanilla spice. Just when you think the heat is missing it gets you and lingers for a good stretch. Nice spicy and oaky features too. This is one to have as a staple.

3.0,"The nose is a bit dirty, with definite oak/char and grain.  It feels full bodied, and again the oak is very present on the palette.  As it fades there is good sweetness and a caramel or toffee.  There is still a little dirty (socks?) or something that pops during the finish.  Pleasant but not a highlight."
4.75,"Tried 3 different versions of this at drammers club. 4 year, 5 year, and 7 year. The 4 Year has notes of Spearmint, Marshmallow, Pepper, Caramel, Apple, Spicy finish, Floral, and dulce de leche. The 5 Year has notes of Vanilla, Floral, Caramel, Cloves, Dill, Pepper, Mint, Coconut, and Marshmallow. The 7 Year is 5 star worthy and has notes of Caramel, Chocolate, Floral, Mint, Dill, Pepper, Cinnamon, Cloves, Orange, Port, and a Spicy Finish. These all have bourbon/rye crossover noses, bourbon palates, and rye finishes."
4.5,Good! Nice and smooth. Little burn. It's one of those whiskeys you could use as a mixer or sop on its own. Not too complex but interesting.
