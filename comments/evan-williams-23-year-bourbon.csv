Nose: Oak and more oak, sweetmess, vanilla and caramel ( tannins or ethanol when 1st poured and nosed)??
Palate a lot of the same oak, sweetmess, vanilla and caramel
Finish smooth at 1st then tannic wood, a  little hot,  long lasting,
For the price point of a bottle nice to try but not worth it to me to spend $350 for a bottle, although 23 years Heaven Hill juice does command some respect."

4.25,"The color is a deep and rich amber and it leaves a veil of oil on the sides of the glass that quickly turns to heavy legs that run all the way down the glass. The nose starts immediately with a great balance of vanilla and toasted oak that on a second take begins to mix with a rye spiciness that has an almost spearmint and floral quality to it. As it opens up, all these notes come pleasantly together and is joined by touches of coconut and sweet butter. The palate is dry and chewy and fills the mouth with vanilla and toasted oak, followed quickly by a burst of baking spices, mostly cinnamon. It melts together for a very creamy mouthfeel, with the whole experience wrapping up with floral rye filling the mouth. The finish is medium long and oaky with vanilla lingering while the notes of baking spices keep the mouth feeling hot and spicy. The finish is not as long as hoped for as the creaminess fades before you realize it, which was the most pleasing element of this bourbon. Despite being 23 years old, it doesn't show its age and it stays rather tame."

0.5,Put it in a blind test of 9 bourbons and whiskeys. It was hands down the worst. Nose and initial taste was noce but the finish was absolutely awful.

5.0,This one developed beautiful flavors from approximately 3-5 drops of water. Absolutely fantastic bourbon. Sampled 2oz @ $25
4.0,Beautiful flavor with a surprisingly floral tail that is refreshing and exciting. Wonderful whiskey but not quite wonderful enough for its high price.
