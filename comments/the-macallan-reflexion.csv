5.0,Wowser! That was delicious.
5.0,"This is hands down, the most amazing scotch I have every tasted.  The nose is caramel and pear.  The sherry comes through and covers the tongue, along with raisins and citrus.  The finish is smooth and long.  I am ruined!!"

5.0,"Beautifully fragrant on the nose, with stonefruit, dried figs, cooked pears and aged oak coming through. Full-bodied, fruity and creamy mouthful, with a delicious combination of vanilla-yogurt covered raisins and baking spices on the palate. The finish is long, with a spicy and slightly citric aftertaste. Overall, this whisky is delicious, elegant and near perfect. Arguably one of the best whiskys I have had."

5.0,"Now that's magical! If I factor in the price, it's a solid four stars because this ain't work $1600 CAD. 

Sherry on the nose and almost winy like a vermouth, with a velvety texture on the tongue. The palate is not woodsy, but there are wood spices and ginger. Pleasant bitterness on the finish with a touch of orange rind and oak making an appearance 30 seconds in. 

Extremely complex and fantastic!"

4.0,"Got to try a bit of this beauty at a promotional event. 

The nose is an orgasmic knockout punch of sweet, fruity sherry, which betrays it’s far less sweet palate. The palate is extremely rich and refined, with a heavy and oily mouth feel with a slight acidity. Notes of Oloroso sherry are at the fore front with dry raisins, prune and dates making up most of the profile. Additionally, there are some notes of wood and a bit of orange and lemon. The finish was disappointingly short but that may be due to the minuscule amount that I was given (about 1/3-1/2 a dram). Compared to the Rare Cask this whisky trades sweetness for richness and if I had to pick between the two I’d likely go for the Rare Cask, but if Macallan ever decides to make a Yankee candle out of this I’ll buy a shipping containers worth."

5.0,"Santiago, Chile, the Ritz Carlton maaaan this is one pricey as hell dram I’m sipping wondering if corporate expenses will pick this up when I submit the , but who cares it’s after midnight and after tasting the 18, Rare Cask, 21 year old well I’m ready for this nectar of the gods! There’s no point writing what I think it tastes like because it is a sensual delight, an orgasm of the tongue and consciousness. This has been one great night and the need to drown in oblivion. There’s no way out now."
