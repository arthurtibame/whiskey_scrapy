3.75,"The last Tojak cask I had (also Benriach) was a collective meh from those at the tasting night. This was an improvement solely because it is a peated Tojak. Now I won't say peat solves all the world's problems (don't want to start another COVID-19 cure rumor) but man throw some in there and it does change the equation.

Now it is the thinner more acidic aftertaste burny sensation peat which i'm not a fan of but it does add character.  The Tojak is definitely in the background and you could have told me refill bourbon and I wouldn't have picked the difference."
