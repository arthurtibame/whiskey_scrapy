3.0,"Aromas of sweet vanilla and toasted marshmallow. Medium bodied, some warmth, flavors reminiscent of aromas. Long dry finish that isn't unpleasant. A bit overpriced but a reasonably good whiskey nonetheless."
3.0,"A faint aroma of banana and brown sugar.  As with the nose, the palate is sweet with hints of caramel.  Light an easy.  A short finishes.  Rather enjoyable.  Not overly complex.  [84/100][Tasted: Whiskey on the Hudson 2015]"
