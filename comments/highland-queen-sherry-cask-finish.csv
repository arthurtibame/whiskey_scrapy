2.5,"At 46%abv and 25.00US it's not bad, but it's not great. It has an old funk about it. Not spoiled or rotten. Ever had a box of old sunmaid raisins? That's what I'm getting on the nose and the palette is the same with a bitter finish. Perhaps they used some worn out  cask that are imparting this strong flavor."
3.0,A bit sweeter than the blended.  Not a ton of flavor.  Something for non scotch drinkers.
