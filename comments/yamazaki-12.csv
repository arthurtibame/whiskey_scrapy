3.5,"My search for this bottle at SRP finally ended about 3 weeks ago! I happened to luck into it at what is fast becoming my go to Whiskey destination Costco! Not only did I find a bottle but was able to get it for under SRP at $79.99. They also had the Hakashu 12 for $109. Having tasted that one I just didn't feel it was worth north of $100 (especially with a Lag 16 sitting next to from $69.99). 
It's always hard to be subjective when you finally find something you read a lot about and then finally find it, but after 3 weeks with it and the fill level now just under the shoulder, I think the time has come to review. Let's dive in!
On the palatte it's delicate, yet buttery. A fruit forward entry with citrus peel and honeydew melons being the predominant notes. Graham crackers are laced in there with a soft barrel spice note. The mid palette adds apricots, toffee and oak leading to a medium finish that is filled with wood (oak and cedar) clove and again those fruit notes the are less fresh fruit and now more dried fruits.
This is one that takes real time to appreciate. The first couple of times I tasted it, I missed a lot of the depth. It's all very delicate and subtle and not in your face. I feel that someone who is more experienced with single malts probably has an even better appreciation for this dram that I do. As it stands, I personally feel the Hakashu is the superior dram. However, there is no doubt this one is also an excellent Whisky. 
Now let's talk about value. Even with me getting it for well below market ($79.99) I would argue that it's a marginal value. Yes it's good, but it's just about $80 good. Certainly not a steal at that price. I don't know that it's a good buy north of what I paid. Look I understand the supply is limited and the demand is insane and thus the $200 price tag I see often placed on this. However, purely from a quality standpoint, this doesn't warrant that hype. I maybe in the minority but that is my honest assessment. 
As for seeking out a pour, I wouldn't pay north of $20 and honestly even at that price it's a hard sell. 
All that said, it's a lovely Whisky that I am very happy to own. Hopefully this helps anyone else hunting this one to tread lightly and not pay above the odds. Cheers all!"

3.75,"This is a whisky that I've wanted to try for a while now, and I finally had the chance on a recent NYC swing at the Copper Still in Chelsea.  

I found the Yamazaki 12 to be a classic Japanese whisky in most respects - sweet, floral and pretty.  But there is one oddity that I'm not sure I can get past - I found a strong bubblegum note on the palate.  It wasn't just a fleeting thing - it was there throughout.  Interetingly, I searched the reviews here and elsewhere, and while a handful of people found bubblegum on the nose, I didn't find any other comments about it on the palate.

Overall, I like this whiskey - it's smooth sweet, and very pleasant.  But I'm struggling with the idea of paying $100+ for a whiskey that reminds me of something I bought for 25¢ a pack in fifth grade.  Perhaps another tasting is in order..."

2.75,"Funny how a rare whisky in today's market has over 2k tastes!  

Nose - Well no shocker here but this is citrus fruit out the max.  A friend recently showed me a note of peach he got on lag 16...that's here but with grape fruit or some kind of lemon and I'm sorry but I'm getting a bit too much alcohol type notes in there to pull that one out.  There's a bit of spice in the background (bottle says clove and I'll go with that).  At the finish I get some vanilla and oak.  There's also just the slightest touch of a red fruit that has me thinking just a TINY bit of sherry, but I'm pretty sure there isn't any.  

Taste - I'm still getting something making me think sherry.  Citrus fruits.  A touch of spice.  A lot of vanilla and butter together.  There's a red fruit here.  Super nice stuff.  

The finish because these are so popular I guess I must.  It's just vanilla, some spice, touch of oak.   It's got a nice long lingering note for a 12 year.  

100 bucks locally, should have bought more, but would have felt guilty.  I really like this, it's darn good but I won't actively chase another bottle.  I'm debating in my head tonight if this is better than Westland or not and to be honest, this one is going to be more enjoyed by more people but I don't think it's better whisky.  I might come back to this one but for now 2.75.  The hype might be a bit too much."

4.0,"I don’t have many Japanese whiskies under my belt, so I decided to go ahead and open my bottle of this 12 year old single malt from Yamazaki. I paid $85 for this bottle a couple years ago before the world went crazy for Japanese whisky. Secondary market values are currently $100-115, so not a huge markup from retail, but still it has appreciated. The maturation is primarily ex bourbon, but there is also sherry and Mizunara oak as well in the mix. Bottled at 43% ABV and although there doesn’t appear to be a definitive answer one way or another, I believe this is chill filtered and has colorant added making it a honey gold. 

The nose opens as a combination of sweet, crisp apples, baked apples, and apple pie drizzled with caramel sauce. Oak, both American and Mizunara with a little barrel char. Very fruity and a bit floral with cherry blossoms. Peaches, red grapes, mulberries, candied pineapple and strawberry hard candy. Lots of honey, it really permeates the whole experience, along with cereal malt, pecans and some light sherry. More caramel with some toffee and a little vanilla. Some almonds/almond flour and marzipan here and there. 

The palate is rich but not overtly sweet. Baked goods like apple pie. A bit of wood spice, nutmeg mostly, almonds, and lightly malty. Bourbony notes but also some sherry in there as well. Honey, vanilla and quite fruity. Apples, peaches, lots of citrus - mostly oranges/orange peel and a touch of pomelo.  A new one for me, but there was a definite hint of watered down cranberry juice, very unexpected but quite welcome. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is a bit creamy, mouth coating and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long with gentle spice, honey, oak, peaches, apples and even light bananas. 

Depending on the day, the nose ranges anywhere from delicate to assertive and can be very nice at times and somewhat boring at others. The palate is really good and is the star of the show (not that the nose was bad in any way). I don’t think this 12 year old quite lives up to the hype or the price, but still is a solid single malt. No doubt it would be far superior if it was presented to us at 46% and without chill filtration or colorant. 3.75-4
Cheers."

4.25,"I pick up this glass of deep copper juice and bring it to my nose. Immediately it shouts “Get ready for a damn good Speyside scotch.” What pours over my palate is reminiscent of the smoothness of an 18 year old Speyside, but richer and with a twist. I get the floral, I get the butterscotch and light oak. A hint of smoke and citrus flair, too, as the dram continues. And best of all, I get a nice oily lingering finish absent from many Speysides I enjoy. It’s most comparable to a well-done Speyside scotch, but the complexity steps beyond that billing. Bravo and arigato."

4.25,"The only other Yamazaki i had was the distiller's reserve and i treasured it for a long time. Now i have tasted the 12yo, which is the real entry to the core expressions and it did not dissapoint. 

This is a fine, complex dram, very well crafted and absolutely enjoyable. Maybe the score could be higher, but i try to be fair to my feelings when tasting a new whisky, and even if it is a very balanced dram, it wasn't perfect in any of the scoring criteria, but was high enough to be a dram that i recommend. 

Bottled at 43%abv, burnished gold.

On the nose, a lot is going on: Blackberry marmalade, Heather, Sweet figs, Prunes, Vanilla, Earthy peatiness, Spent matches, Sherry. 

On the palate it was delicious, but a little bitter. Prunes, Heather, Sherry, Ashes, Rum, Nuts. 

Aftertaste was nice too: Ashy, sulphuric finish, grapes. Hints of smoke and pepper.

Overall i give this dram a 89 over 100. Just one point more would make it a 4.5 star dram, maybe it deserves it and this time i am been too harsh. Its a great dram and you should totally try it and see for yourselves if it deserved more or not."

4.0,The higher quality Japanese offerings are becoming scarce. My bottle came as a backroom special from one of my local stores.  Nose is ever so lightly peated with slight grain notes. The taste follows the lead with a light peat backbone danced around by hints of almond and marzipan. The finish is quite lovely and lingering almond biscotti tastes.
4.25,"Color is very light, like a young scotch.

Legs after extremely slow and almost difficult to create.

Nose: peaty, some floral undertones, cherry blossom perhaps some semblance of saki like flavors

Body: very familiar scotch like flavors but curiously different, maybe some elderflower or cherry blossom, even minutes later I'm still trying to pin point it. 

Finish: more like the body than the nose, not super strong at 86 proof with an easy scotch bite. 

My first Japanese whisky, I was expecting more traditional Kentucky whiskey/bourbon and got a lot more scotch like flavors.  Very easy to drink and I can see why some people fall in love with it."
