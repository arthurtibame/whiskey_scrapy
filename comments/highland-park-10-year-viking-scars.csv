3.75,"Good choice, advised by my oldest son"
2.5,"Morsom ettersmak, hadde håpt på litt meir smak. Men lett og god"
3.5,I was expecting a bit more smoky taste but was disappointed a bit. Quite intense though. Not bad hut didn't enjoyed much.

3.5,Excellent peated scotch. More dedicated to be an after dinner scotch. Needs to have something to eat before or a strong aperitivo.

3.75,"Nez : chaleureux, poire, chocolat , terreau/pelouse grasse, noisette, légère vanille, tourbe légère et légèrement mentholé 
Palais : chaud et salé et chloré, fruits du verger, noisette et tourbe légère
La finale est moyenne, fumée, mentholée et chocolatée avec une touche de noisette

Une entrée facile pour les non-amateurs de whiskys tourbés. Manque légèrement de complexité mais c’est un bon whisky pour l’âge et le prix"

3.0,"Clean and sharp, grass, citrus hint of smoke at the end. Young and thin."
2.75,"Quite a strong alcohol hit at first taste.  Sherry, orange peel and ginger are the first things you notice after the alcohol.  As it develops, you pick up some light peat, salt and some lighter floral notes.  

It’s not a bad dram, but it does taste young and a little unrefined.  Easy to drink, and worth a second visit."

3.75,"Аромат: Изюм, мох с росой, косточка абрикоса мокрая, вишневый лист, мякоть сдобной булочки с маком, эвкалипт, замороженный красный чай, пуанта анорексички, фиалка и красная смородина.

Вкус: дуб, шляпка мухомора, можевельник и кусочек торфа! Обволакивающий как смерть во сне. 

Молодой!"

3.25,"Oily. Well balanced whisky from the very northern Orkney Islands. Nosing unravels a mixture of citrus fruits that gets less sweet and more thorough in its tasting. Peatiness is promised, although only gently found in the palette."

2.5,"This is a newer, European release exclusive, 10 year expression from Highland Park...and, yes, it has the Viking-theme designation:  Viking Scars.  (Rolling eyes emoji).  This stuff is also so exclusive that they had to shrink the bottles to 35cl to make sure there’s plenty for the crazy high demand.  I assume it was also diluted to 40% to help stretch it, as well.  The only good part of all this is that I landed a bottle for $18.

Appearance-wise, it’s rich gold and really oily, with lots of runny legs and medium-sized, watery drops in the Glencairn tasting glass.  The nose seems much closer to an ex-bourbon matured HP than their typical Oloroso sherry stuff.  Apples, pears and orange wedges greet you almost immediately.  There’s very little smoke, which has become more of the norm with HP recently.  Oak tannins and heather round things out and there’s absolutely zero heat or ABV presence, but that’s no surprise really.

The palate focuses a bit more on the sherry cask notes:  raisins and fresh-pressed grapes mingle with some orange marmalade.  It has an oily and warm mouthfeel with hints of salty peat and smoke on the very backend.  It’s very thin and sweeter than I expected, since I figured the youthful age would hinder this one and create a more abrasive and maybe give it a new make vibe.  But, that’s not really the case.  It’s sweet and borderline one dimensional.  The finish is short, but vibrant and slightly harsh.  Sherry and orchard fruit linger again, but cause it to lean a bit too dessert-like for my tastes.

Overall, I don’t know the real reason for this release.  Small bottles tend to indicate something more limited, yet highly prized- and this certainly wouldn’t be considered prized.  The diluted nature and 10 year age statement feel like they’re just trying to keep up with the Joneses.  Oh, so and so has a 10yo release?  We need to get in on that.  Adding the Viking nameplate is an embarrassing move here, too.  Everything about this screams mediocrity, so that’s the fitting score I will give it.  2.5 stars.  The price is right, I guess, but I’m not bumping this score just for that.  Just move along...even you HP fanboys, there’s nothing to see here.  Cheers"
