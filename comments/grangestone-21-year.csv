4.0,"I had a sample of this at total wine in houston and it is a nice Whisky. Bottled at 40%.

On the nose and palate:  apples with dim smoke. Beautiful balance between fruity and peatiness. Aftertaste has a puff of dim smoke.

Overall this whisky is a good offering. 82 over 100."

3.0,"This was my first Scotch and at the time I thought it was great. As I've progressed in my Whiskey and Scotch journey, I've realized that this isn't great. I think it deserves a solid 3/5 stars. It's a very middle of the road Scotch, but there are plenty of others with a better value. This is a little too sweet like honey for my taste. Also a little shallow in flavor."
4.0,Disappointed to see this at only 2.4 stars.  This single malt has a ton of great flavors and a great nose.

1.0,This I am told is aTotal Wine featured product that they are to suggest.   Completely unremarkable for a 21 year old bottle.   Much better values and bottles to be had for the price

null,Don't waste your money. Your better off buying the dalmore 12 year or dalwhinnie anything. This does not taste like a 21 year. Total wine will push this brand on you but that's their job. This has nowhere near the depth flavor or smoothness a 21 year should have. For 80 bucks you could find a much better highland
