3.5,"Here is another dram that, though I found for a steal compared to normal MSRP, I found quite underwhelming. I love Bourbon and I love good Brandy but sum of its parts left no real discerning character. It was not bad by any means but it became relegated to cocktails despite the guilt that came with knowing its price tag."

4.0,"Neat to start and added ice halfway.
Berry jam, perhaps raspberry jam, on the nose along with vanilla bean freshly scraped off the pod. Palate reminiscent of scotch origins with mild peat coming through first but then opening up to a wider array including macerated cherries, a sneaky grassy note, and something nutty between walnut and pecan, maybe even both. Peat lingers in the finish and adding ice brightens up the cherry with every sip."

5.0,I find the aroma to be very appealing. The fact that it is a lower proof makes it an easier sipping bourbon. One of my favorites.

3.0,"Taste young even with the 2 years in Brandy. Must have been real young before second cast?
Astringent with spice and rye. (Yes I know it's wheat-but I taste rye)Pear and fruit up front followed with cinnamon. Like other Masters not anything special and not worth the BIG premium price."

2.0,"3 Stars is a value score with this one. WR's marketing team really got me here. Butterscotch nose was a tease. Sweet and Astringent on the pallet with a clean/dry finish. Not very interesting at $100, I needed it to be interesting. Glad I got 20% off on black Friday, but still overpaid 15-$20."

3.0,"Not as much going on as I would have hoped. Light and sweet up front before brandy finishing lingers on the short finish. Worth a try, but not worth the cost of a full bottle."

3.0,"Smells of fermented raisins. I know this is a brandy note but I was surprised at the strength of that note until I read that this has been finished for two whole years in brandy casks. I get some hints of baking spice as well. On the tongue, it feels so silky, really a great experience. But before I can relish that for too long, the spices kick in very quickly, and intensely. Lots of wood notes. It finishes with spice and a hint of dark chocolate. Medium to long finish. The brandy influence is there, but nothing like the nose. Not as complex as I was hoping. But still a good pour. 8/17/17"

4.0,"Tawny color. Floral notes like perfume, fabric softener, then moving on to fruit, but not the raisins I was expecting, but rather solvent like paint. The taste is very winey, Chardonnay comes to mind. Then we're back to paint notes with a salty finish. Overall, delicious, but then I'm a big Islay fan."

5.0,"Great oaky and vanilla nose with sweet chocolate. The palette is very sweet and rich. Loads of vanilla with a thick mouth feel. The medium finish brings a little char and oak. Not a lot of spice or burn. Almost to smooth, before I knew it nearly a 3rd of the bottle was gone! If you like sweet you love this one. 

Colonial Little Rock $105"

5 in my books.

4.0,"One of the few whiskeys I've ever encountered that has a taste of (of all things) melon to it! Underneath, you can still tell this is a bourbon, but once you let it rest on your palate for a while you can pick up a taste of sour grapes, a bit of eucalyptus, and finally an outright blast of canteloupe or honeydew right at the end. The juice as a whole isn't exactly smooth, but the harshness of it going down actually does well to balance out the cavalcade of fresh fruits that appear elsewhere."

4.5,"Nose - Intense fruity dark caramel, dark toffee, dried blueberries/cranberries, vanilla, hints of sweet spicy oak

Taste - Pleasant sweet spicy tingle, dark toffee, dark chocolate, hints of raisins, dried blueberries, hint of candied orange, vanilla, faint hint of almond/hazelnut skin bitterness, fruity dark roast coffee

Finish - Light lingering fruity spice, light nutty bitterness, dark chocolate covered coffee toffee, caramel

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - I really quite like this one. It hits on most of the flavors I really like in a bourbon. The brandy cask is prominent in the added fruity notes and I think it complements it quite well. Great nose on this one as it's a great balance of dark chocolate, sweet nuts, & dried fruits that all go very well together. Like a good dark chocolate toffee bark or something. Great taste on the palate as most of the stuff in the nose is also present. The light bitterness complements everything well & isn't off putting (at least to me). I think this would be best enjoyed neat as any additional water or ice or bitters might mask the subtle brandy influence that's present.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"
