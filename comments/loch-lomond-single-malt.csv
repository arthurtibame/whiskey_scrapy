2.0,"7/21/16 - Highlands sample from Scotch Whisky Experience. Loch Lomond Original. 
Barely any legs. Barely any finish. Definitely a Highlands whiskey. Smoky on the bottom of my tongue."

3.0,"Old school peat, orange peel, light brine and pine needles on the nose. The nose reminds me a little of something by Springbank but its not in same class at the same time. My first taste was disappointing with light peat and brine finish being the only highlights. It’s smooth like the other Loch Lomond I have reviewed and well defined. It certainly improves as you get to the bottom of the glass – that’s a good sign for what is a cheap scotch. It’s a nice dram and I like it but with my reviewer hat on it just doesn’t take off which is a pity. Taste is some malt sweetness and light fruit followed by dry tannin and oak spice. Some peat and a touch of sea salt complete the picture.  Medium bodied and a not a long finish but nothing to hate either. I prefer the Reserve even though this does offer more in the glass – sometimes it's better to tell a short story well than bigger one only so so.  3 stars or 88."

4.0,"Scotch Whisky Experience: 4. Pro note: old gold, floral (even piney) with hint of cereal, malty with subtle smoke and citrus. I like it, reminds me of Arizona pine."
3.0,"@Joost. vrij vlakke whisky, niks geks, wel ok"
3.0,"Nose: sweet tropical fruit (reminiscent of some rums), savoury notes, a bit of peat smoke
Palate: prolongs the nose, with bright juicy tropical fruit nicely balanced with peat and a buttery malt
Finish: short to medium, mostly peat but with quick peeks of ripe cooked fruit
An easy, mellow, smooth dram. It's nothing exceptional but it's still very fair, and makes for a nice drink at the end of a long day. The kind of whisky you should stock for everyday use, cocktails, and informal enjoyment among like-minded friends."

1.0,"Drank in the bath out of plastic cups, so perhaps didn’t give it fair footing. 

R: First taste: chemicals, like I shouldn’t be drinking this. Like too much of heads and tails are there. Bad. Polluted. Smells like nail polish remover. Second taste: kind of the same, but I can sort of see fruity at the beginning. 

D: fruity foretaste. Nutty aftertaste. Coffee? Roasted?"

4.0,"I prefer peated whisky, and this Loch Lomond is an interesting mix of lightly peated, with herbal and fruity notes. It helps me to dilute the tastes after highly peated Laphroaig and Ardberg.

1.75,"This came in a 3x 50ml taster set. It was on special so it was a good opportunity to see what’s going on with this very modestly priced new range from Loch Lomond.

Well... this one falls into the NAS budget malts. You pay for what you get although for the money I would prefer a malt blend like monkey shoulders.

Nose:
Very light on aroma but the smells that flit into focus are mostly pleasant.
Vanilla 
Blend of fruit juices
Very faint second hand cigarette smoke

Arrival:
Dilute, nothing shows until development 
Watery 
There isn’t even a youthful kick 
There is the odd claim “smoothed to perfection” on the label. It’s not telling lies you could down this bottle without a splutter.

Development:
Soft here too,
A little toffee
A little... little! Peaty hint

Finish:
Barley husk dry
Menthol herbal

I’m glad I tasted this in a sample bottle. Perhaps a bad move from the marketing placing it in with the 12 and 18."
3.0,Decent lightly smoked islay style scotch. Pleasantly surprised for a sub $26 single malts Scotch.
2.75,"A tender golden olive colour.
A striking chemical aroma of insecticides with bright tones of stinky hard swiss cheese. Also something wet like a dump fabric plus some coconut (lol) and a little of peat. Well, it does not differ much from Loch Lomond Reserve blend as concerns its fundamnetal structure. But as far as it is single malt the typical grain/spiritous notes are absent here.
The taste contains a subtle smokiness and peat, some citruses (oranges mainly or even orange juice) and apples + some spices. It's sweet and bitter in equal measure what makes the taste remarkable but not very pleasant.
Aftertaste is bitter with some medicinal notes, but again sweet on the edges of the tongue.
Looking at the Loch Lomond distillery it makes me wonder whether these guys are either underrated or overrated as, on the one hand, guys do an amazing job in reestablishing the brand and offer a highly diverse range of whiskies, however and, broadly speaking, therefore we get a problem of a materialistic kind - are they able to evolve through the experiments and create something truly epic despite the fact that the production capacities are very high what makes it possible to stop right there and right now and not evolve at all."

2.5,"Nose: Malt, ale, dark earthy aromas, grassy hay. Some notes of orange zest, caramel, coconut and pine oil. There is a wisp of peat smoke, but it might just be a smoky barrel-char note.

Palate: A smooth and oily entry with sweet rich malty notes to the front. As it develops there are some toffee and dark fruit flavours and a faint smokiness. A general cereal character provides the background.

Finish: Medium/short. Sweet with a touch of sour peat. There is a hint of lemongrass, menthol and spice in the pleasant aftertaste.

The nose is satisfyingly oily and dense, but not really that complex. It bears a family resemblance to several other whiskies in Loch Lomond's portfolio, and is also reminiscent of Ben Nevis. The palate is perfectly acceptable but not particularly interesting. The whisky does have excellent body and texture, and an accompanying heftiness of taste.

Not a stunner, but certainly not unpleasant or disappointing. This bottom-shelf NAS single malt is worth the inexpensive ticket price, but for me the even cheaper Loch Lomond Reserve blended whisky is better value and has a much smokier character.  However, like all Loch Lomond whiskies, this is definitely worth tasting at least once and performs well as a mixer. Adding water does not change it much.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars."

This would be an every day drop for me-not something for company with a complex palate. Hopeful for future tastings as this distillery surely has more to offer."

3.25,"This might have the most heat of any Scotch I've had thus far. The nose is a huge fusel burn, rubbing alcohol at first. It is followed by a second wave of butterscotch and salt. 

The taste is another huge burn in the middle of the palate. Some tobacco ash, charcoal, leather. The peat that does exist manifests itself as dry ash.

The finish is buttery, with a slick feel on the back end. On the lips, there is a an ashy, smoky component, like smoldering embers. The burn never really goes away. Coffee grounds at the tail end.

It's not an incredibly complex Scotch, but it's dependable, pleasant, and extremely properly priced."

4.0,"This Single Malt comes from the Highland area but has a very important element in its composition: peat.

Starting with the Single Malt expression out of a small series of reviews that I will carry out; Loch Lomond Original is full of flavor.

To begin with, it is one of the few, if not the only, whiskey that has cork in the local market. From there, there is a difference in quality with the other offers in the Ecuadorian market.

It has a burnished gold color and good viscosity, its aroma:  Malt, Red apples, Cinnamon and Vanilla cookies.
Very sweet. Very attractive. Honey after several minutes and after taking a couple of sips: raisins.

On the palate it is powerful and very different from the nose: malt, tobacco, ash, moderate peat and black pepper. Its aftertaste is spicy with ash and moderate smoke.

- Cut with 2 drops of water:
Pure cinnamon in its aroma.

On the palate, it softens a lot and is very easy to drink, but due to the peat it does not lose character. Leather and cinnamon notes. The aftertaste with notes of smoke and light spice.

My personal conclusion is that its price / quality ratio is amazing. A very good product, which does not exist elsewhere in Ecuador. 80/100"
3.0,"Well I loved the LL 12 year and saw this for $24 so scooped it. Poured neat, the nose, palate and finish are all reminiscent of the 12 yr but dialed back. The flavors aren't as defined and don't have the vibrancy or depth of the age statement release. That said this is still solid scotch. It has the lovely fruit, smoke/peat and wood notes all for a budget price. This and Speyburn Bradan Orach are my top value scotches. Think of this as Highland Park 12 on the cheap as it has a similar profile. ........81/100......easy repurchase for low cost single malt (though the superior 12 year can be had for about $10 more )"
3.0,"A bit boring, but very easy to drink. Good starter for newbies"

3.75,"I picked up a Loch Lomond sampler pack containing this one and the 12, 15 and 18 year old.
To be honest I wasn’t expecting much going in, but after a few sips I thought to myself that is actually good. I was enjoying it for sure, it is a bit dirty (in a good way) and very drinkable. For the price point it is very good!
This one shows you why you shouldn’t have your mind made up before hehe."
3.25,"This is a very nice dram. There’s nothing truly outstanding about it, but it’s very quaffable and the finish is longer than I was lead to believe. Very good."
2.75,"Nose: Toffee, sea salt and oranges. A vague metallic note. A bit spirity.

Palate: Salted caramel, dark chocholate. Not very thick though. Some bitterness (from the spirit, not the oak).

Finish: Some coffee and dark chocholate. Again hints of oranges - or orange peels rather. Medium long. 

Overall: Pulls in dufferent directions and is not harmonious. It does have som interesting sides to it though and its surprisingly flavourfull for a relatively cheap NAS single malt. I score it 2.75, i.e. a decent whisky (it’s closer to 3 than to 2.5)."
1.5,"Pretty basic highland on the nose and palette but a bit of bitter/acrid flavor probably from overspent casks. Not horrible, not great. It’s ok for a cheap single malt...until you realize Lismore is like $2 more and actually pretty good. 

*edit, 1.5 weeks in* Damn, I tried to give this a fair shake. But I’ve downgraded it from a 2.5 to a 1.5.  While the nose is pleasant enough, the palate has just devolved for me. Its all bitter, sweet and a finish that reminds me of morning breath and really shitty coffee...it’s just NOT good. Not at any price. I’ll finish the bottle—I paid my 2 bits and Im no punk bitch! So this will be the pour I sip after I’m already too buzzed to care, but I won’t be going for another. The higher versions might be worth a try but this one’s a fail for me!"
