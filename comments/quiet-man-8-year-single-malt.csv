3.0,"sample/tempted to give this 4 stars, as I think it has a unique after taste reminiscent of Tullamore Dew.  I see one review says sawdust?!  that actually might be it...also hints of chlorine.  May not be for everyone, though it stands out.  2nd sample/nice oats & toasted bread finish."

2.0,Starts off great with the sweet and citrus. Ending is a bit odd on the palate. A little chalky and losses the flavour.

3.75,Definitely very floral on the nose with baked goods and some vanilla sweetness. The palate is pretty spicy with a little bit of fruitiness. Maybe apple? A little cinnamon as well. The finish is long lasting and ends with dried fruit. Great Irish whiskey without breaking the bank.

3.75,Found this at the “mega VABC”. Didn’t even know they made an 8 year. Solid evening getting my brother-in-law ready for his Ireland trip.

4.0,The taste is leaning towards biscuits and vanilla. Lighter in flavor than the blended Quiet Man but better as a sipping whiskey. The nose is all biscuits with vanilla.

2.25,"Not a lot of flavour, dry, hot. Tastes much younger than 8 years to me, maybe just not very good barrels.

I wouldn't buy this again."

5.0,"What an interesting whiskey, this threw me off at first, I put it on ice and it immediately dissipated into almost nothing. Really nice champagne and butterscotch nose, with some oak. Taste is oily and dry, with lychee, elderflower, toffee, and a dry applewood finish. This whiskey needs to be held in the mouth to really appreciate it, after a night of 10 or so whiskeys bring this one out and get ready for a visit to a different land. Slainte"

4.0,"Poured neat this offers a nose of malt, dark honey, hard biscuit and gentle spiciness. In the mouth these same flavors come across, along with a vanilla/butterscotch, the vanilla being very evident--probably due to the finishing of this malt in first fill bourbon barrels. There is the slightest hint of pepper on the finish, and the tongue remains filled with the overall flavors as if there may be some oiliness to the dram. The mouthfeel is more viscous than the typical Irish. Nowhere on the bottle or their web site do they claim triple distillation, so MAYBE it isn't and that accounts for the softer mouthfeel. It is an enjoyable dram and somewhat affordable in my KC area at $35. I will purchase again."
3.5,"Nose: Quite fruity. Fresh.

Flavour: Getting a bit of oak. Faint hit of a spicy tingle.

Finish: Not very long but pleasant. Almost comes across as a bit flowery towards the end."
