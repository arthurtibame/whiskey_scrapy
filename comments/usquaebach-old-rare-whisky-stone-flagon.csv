3.25,"Nose: grainy, faint sweetness, oak, raisins, heather, sherry
Body: light
Palate: heather with wafts of smoke but faint. Sweet, honey, very smooth. 
Finish: short and sweet
Note: the oaky nose is not on the palate. This is nice but not amazing."
3.75,"Overall, this is a good blend without too much peat (not a big fan of when it seems to be overloaded) and the clay jug is pretty cool too have in your collection as well."
