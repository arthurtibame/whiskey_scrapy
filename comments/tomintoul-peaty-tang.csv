4.0,Very peaty. Smooth. Cream-like finish.
3.75,"A scoop! For the price, nothing wrong with it. Sweet, young, green forest, wet gunpowder smoke, earthy, fresh, fruity and happy. Lingering peat. Nice, kind, extremely good value. Definitely a buy again!"

3.5,"Despite being called Peaty Tang, it definitely does not have an overpowering peatiness and displays slight sparks of campfire smoke. The dram is decent by its self or suitable for a cocktail such as a boulevardier."
3.5,Smells and taste reminds me of a menthol medicine
4.0,"Sweet and mellow as you would expect from the gentle dram, but enough smoke to keep you interested. Subtle salinity and well-balanced."
4.0,Peaty but incredibly smooth.
2.0,"Nose has an earthy base that is malty that contains notes of honey, lemon, floral, faint whispers of peat, which leaves impressions of damp leaves, with a slight amount of vanilla.  A thin, diluted, soft body that contains honey and iodine and is slightly phenolic.  It has a finish that is medium short that lingers in the front.  The honey sweetness dissolves to black pepper and leaves the palate ashy and bitter, like smoking a cheap cigar. The addition of water opens more floral and honey tones but mutes the peat however the peat is more pronounced in the mouth.  Finish is shorter and more balanced.  Preferrable with a splash of water.  This is a dram that doesn't know what it wants to be: a young Speysider that is wishing to be an Islay. This is not a bad dram and is priced extremely fair. [84/82/100]. [Revisited: 4/17/15]. [Revisited: 5/23/15; 11/22/17]."

1.0,"Charcoal lighter fluid sold as single malt scotch whisky, maybe I'll use it for that purpose. Did I get a bad bottle? Very few whiskies go into the undrinkable category, this one makes the hall of shame."

It's garbage."

3.0,"Beautifully balanced and enjoyable, but without being really memorable. Lemony and peaty. Kind of reminds me of an Ardbeg, but with everything toned down to about half-power (and clearly not in the same league!). A lovely dram from a rapidly improving distillery."
2.0,"Awh hell! Peaty Tang is an understatement. That tang is an overwhelming clang on the nose and palate.  Just a wreck that makes finding other notes a task.  Major pickling effect going on with it. I definitely get a briny funk, and not in a nice refreshing maritime manner. The finish is thankfully short, but sour. I would definitely pass on this one.  I can’t even think of a fitting song for the dram. Maybe “Sour Girl” by Stone Temple Pilots, but I like the song too much for that. Even though it wasn't for me, thanks Ryan for the sample!"
2.0,"I finally took some time yesterday morning to sit down with this one and give it a proper go (I’ve been working nights the last 2 weeks due to a safety inspection at my work- I don’t make it a habit of waking up and getting tipsy.  In case you were wondering, lol).

This bottle was offered up as a sample for our tour group by Ryan, via me.  Tomintoul advertises themselves as the gentle dram.  This peated version is something they do a couple times a year to fill out their portfolio, I think.  I get the whole gentle dram when it comes to sherried or even ex-bourbon Speyside style malts.  A gentle peat whisky seems out of place, IMO.  Just like this bottle...

The nose is quite heavily peated and smoked.  If there are some gentle fruit notes intended they were overpowered by the peat smoke for sure.  It smells a tad sweet, but not overly so.  The palate is also wrecked by the smoke- it’s heavy.  There’s also a metallic flavor that just doesn’t meld well with anything.  I wouldn’t call it harsh- just weird.  The finish is medium length, a bit peppery with another over abundance of smoke.  My first thought was that this was a mediocre whisky with artificial smoke added for effect.  I know it wasn’t made this way, it’s just the impression I got.

Overall, I wouldn’t buy another bottle of this and I really don’t want to finish what I have.  It’s not offensive and worthy of a drain pour- I just don’t have much desire to drink any more of it.  2.25 stars."
2.0,"Part of our Scottish distillery trade team, this was provided by Ryan.  I was so looking forward to this.   It's like back in high school.  Graduation day.  You go to the podium, give the valedictorian speech, collect your awards in math and science.  And then then comes the real fun, you've been looking forward to the night post ceremonies.  You go out with all your friends , pocket full of singles, to your first strip club.  EXCEPT...you're only 17, and your friends are all 18!!!!  And you don't have a fake license.  (sure...get a scholarship to University of Michigan, but can't get a fake license).  And oh..thanks mom and dad for making me skip that extra grade in grammar school...now I'm stuck in Joe's Diner  having coffee and pound cake, while my friends are inside the strip club.    Yes.  That's what this felt like.  Was looking forward to my first Tomintoul, especially with a name like Peaty Tang.   But, instead it's more like a watered down Lagavulin or Ardbeg.   Save yourself the money, and instead pour a dram of Ardbeg, and top it with three drams of water.  Voila, there's your Peaty Tang.  What's the lesson learned in all this?  DON'T MAKE YOUR KIDS SKIP A GRADE."
3.0,"Stop number 36 on the SDT is Tomintoul. This Speyside distillery is located in the area around the river Livet, in the Glenlivet area to be specific. Not to say it is near the Glenlivet distillery, but in the Livet glen. I think I got that right, but I digress. 

Bottled at 40% ABV, and as such I think it's fair to say that it is chill filtered and has colorant added that makes it a yellow gold in color. Peaty Tang is a NAS expression. 

The nose is a lovely soft fruity peat. Not a strong peat at all, somewhere between HP and Lagavulin I would say. It's full of orchard fruits. Apricots, oranges and some lemon. Heather honey and maybe some vanilla. A minuscule amount of oak. A little bit of that ashy/tar note found in many a peated scotch, but it's more fruit than anything else. Plum and white grape juice follow. It's very light overall, but pleasant. 

A very gentle arrival on that palate. Lightly peated. Peat smoke, some ashes. Grilled apricots and maybe pineapple with a touch of coconut. It's sweet, but the sweetness is tempered by the peat. Again, very light but nice. 

Very light mouthfeel. A little oily but mostly thin. Mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium length that turns slightly dry with smoked fruits. 

What can I say?  It's a incredibly light scotch. If it wasn't peated I don't think it would have much flavor at all, except some light fruits. It feels like an Ardbeg 10 that was watered down to 30% ABV or less. Probably a good way to introduce your friends to peated whisky without scaring them off. While there is nothing really wrong with this dram, there isn't anything to grab your attention either. I understand that this is the profile that Tomintoul was going for, but it's just not for me. Bump it up to 48% and nix the chill filtering and you might have something worth buying. As it stands I think $60 for this is too high. $40 would be more appropriate, especially for a NAS. Another distillery checked off the list. Thanks to Ryan for the sample. 3.25
Cheers"
