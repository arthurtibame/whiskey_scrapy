3.0,Very smooth.  High vanilla flavors.  Nutty hint on finish. Good for sipping outside in the cold.  Not enough bite for me. For the price I'd go elsewhere.
5.0,"A good sipping whiskey, this is nowhere near as harsh as many spirits and has a much smoother, sweet flavor. I can't pick out the flavors as well as others, but chilled this is one that I could sip on all night long. When I want something a little sweeter, this whiskey is my top pick. I just wish it was distilled in Texas instead of just blended here."

3.0,My favorite non-bourbon low proof whiskey.  Sweet and easy to drink.  I think it is too mellow for cocktails but then I prefer neat.  The only reason I didn't give it a 4th star is that I'm partial to high proof whiskey.

null,"ridiculously overpriced for what is essentially maker's mark blended with neutral grain vanilla flavored spirit.  If you know you are getting something sweet, it isn't half bad. If you are expecting an actual bourbon taste, it is highly disappointing.  It can be most accurately described as one comment I read, ""a childrens whiskey, if such a thing existed"". (That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if it weren't $40 a bottle)"
4.0,"Simple nose. Sweet caramel, tons of vanilla, smooth. Candy in glass form. I love this whiskey, but you have to understand that it is not a standard whiskey. It's very sweet. Makes a killer Manhattan when you balance it with a heavier, chocolatey bourbon."

1.0,"TX Blended whiskey from FR Distilling. A no age statement Texas bourbon, price $38.99 Sampled 8/4/15 with 3/4 teaspoon of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.

Aroma - Vanilla cake, cookie dough, heavy caramel and yellow cake.

Taste - Vanilla, insanely heavy caramel, cherry cookie, almond, marzipan, butter, cola, maple and short bread cookies.

Finishes with a medium/quick fading flavor and no burn. 

Final score : 1.5 / 5, if ever such a thing existed as children's whiskey, this would be it. It's just so sweet with so many confectionary notes and no savory to round it out or balance them that I can't give it a high score. Might be a good starting whiskey for someone who doesn't like whiskey but wants to get into it or give it a try, but most seasoned drinkers I imagine will find this one unpalatably confectionary. Will not buy again."

3.0,"Nice, sweet whiskey with smells of vanilla and coco, and herbal notes. The taste on the palate has lots of butterscotch and citrus notes that fade away pretty quickly. Good blended whiskey on its own or in a Manhattan."

2.0,"I tried this with dinner while traveling for business in Arlington TX. Wanted something local and this was all they had (passed up a MacAllan 15 for this). Intense sweet vanilla nose, almost confectionary. I knew there had to be some alcohol in there somewhere but I be darned if I could find it. Based on its nose, the taste was unsurprisingly sweet vanilla with a peppery aftertaste (ah! there's the alcohol). It had a very nice full mouth feel, kinda like a mouthful of marshmallows. Not one for an experienced sipper, this could be a great starter whiskey. Dry glass - vanilla ice cream."

3.0,Sweet vanilla on the nose. Young but smooth on the tongue. The bottle top is the coolest part of the whiskey. Old (cowboy) boots are cut and the leather is used on the tops. Worth owning a bottle as a comparison for other blends.

2.0,"Sipped neat. No idea what I drank, but it tasted like no other whiskey I've tried as of yet. The nose is rich creme brûlée and the taste is straight vanilla. It's buttery dessert in a glass. There's some nuttiness in there, but it's almost completely overpowered by sweet notes. The sweetness is cloying, however, and I found it extremely difficult to make it through a 2 oz. pour so I gladly shared it with the rest of the table. Some of the non-whiskey drinkers really enjoyed it. The mouth feel is also very thin. Gotta give credit for the unique flavor and distinct flavor profile, but in the end, this product isn't for me. It literally tastes like whiskey blended with vanilla extract.  If you like sweet dessert whiskies, this is definitely for you. If you like real whiskies, this is going to be a hard pass.
    Note: I would gladly sip this over some Tennessee Honey nonsense though"

Quick heat on the front end that rolls into a burn coupled with more vanilla, some char, and a touch of oak. Starts off like a sprint to the heat, but ends like a marathon with a long, bitter finish. A splash of water takes that bitter edge off, but thins away the vanilla and spice."

All in all not bad. Not a superstar whisky. This seems like a good background whisky that is approachable and will not demand your attention. The vanilla may fatigue your palate after awhile.
