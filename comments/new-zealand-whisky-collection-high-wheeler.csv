3.5,Our house is literally getting torn apart top to bottom at the moment and rebuilt so cooking is a bit hard so friends kindly invited us over and offered us a feed the day after lockdown was over and we were able to socialize. He cracked this open which was part of a triple 200ml set from the NZ Whiskey  Company. It's a lighterstyle refill oak and you can pick the grain influence. Nice to taste a slice of history. Will have to break open my 21 year from this distillery one day.
