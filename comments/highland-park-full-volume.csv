3.0,"Dry sweet smoke and menthol — surprisingly smoky in fact. It’s a little sharp and thin on first sip, but elements of lemon emerge before the smoke returns to underscore the long finish. Intriguing, but I’m not sure it has much to show for its 18 years. A touch of sherry influence might have added the complexity to make this really sing."

4.0,"Nose - Sweet lightly bitter pear cider, light brine, faint salty campfire smoke, light ash, and hints of vanilla.

Taste - Sweet salty, lightly smoky pear cider, light white pepper tingle, coconut water, citrus peel pith bitterness, vanilla.

Finish - Lingering light saline smoke, fruity fresh pear, white pepper tingle.

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting one in that it had this nice light salty smoky balance throughout, but it seemed a bit one dimensional other than that. The ex-bourbon cask really does help highlight their base spirit quite a bit. My palate tends to appreciate a light smoke paired with a hint of sherry or port a bit more, so this wasn't exactly my favorite, but it was relatively well balanced. I could see this being used in a cocktail that could utilize the light salty smoke present without a sherry/port sweetness like a penicillin or even a blood and sand. I wouldn't turn down a dram of this, but wouldn't order it at a bar nor buy a full bottle myself."

4.0,"It’s interesting. Smells sweet and smoky. Taste is decidedly Highland Park. Needs water. 
Update: nose: citrus (lemony) pepper, alcohol. Taste: strong stinging alcohol. Added more water about 10 drops...maybe needs more? Fruity, vanilla, pepper, clove, strong!!"

5.0,"Palate: Slight smoke, slight peat, slight spice, slight fruit... Truly a full volume"
3.5,"Very apricotey, so I'm not such a fan of that, but it's very complex and nicely balanced. Nose quite special, and super smooth and easy to drink, with hints of vanilla"
3.75,"Oh yeah. That's a bourbon barrel, all right.
Yes, you're getting the usual heathered peat notes that you'll get whenever you drink any Highland Park product - only instead of being balanced out by those fruity notes that you get in some of their other offerings (12 year, for example,) you're hit by the oaky vanilla-and-spice notes that you'd expect. The effect can be surprising when you first go in for a taste - though halfway through the glass, it's no longer a ""why is this a thing,"" and is more of a ""why wasn't this a thing sooner"" reaction."

4.25,"Whiskey extravaganza #7

This is the best Highland Park I’ve had in a while and I’m shocked by it. 

This is not a typical HP - it’s only matured in bourbon, it’s bottled at 47.2% instead of 43%, and it’s chill filtered but only brought down to 4 degrees Celsius so HP has only stripped away a portion of the delicious oils and esters. 

Should someone punch their marketing department in the bean bag for calling this “full volume” when they’ve clearly turned down it’s natural volume - yes, that is warranted. And referencing Spinal Tap on your packaging by pointing the dial to 11 when you’ve served the whiskey up at an 8 - not cool ... not cool at all.

But it’s still better than most of the duds that HP has been pumping out lately. 

It’s packed full of rich vanilla bean, pear, and smoked caramel. It reminds me of Tomatin’s Cu Bocan line. 

And this is 17+ years old for $85; that is a steal by HP standards. If you see it, buy it while you can because I’m guessing it won’t be back. But burn the box - shameful HP marketing, just shameful."

3.0,"Not very complex, but a decent dram. I tried this in a flight against some of it's brethren: HP Dark Origins, and HP 12. Out of the three, Full Volume came in last. Mostly due to it being a bit one dimensional. Ironically, I found Full Volume to be the most toned down on the palate. Could use a tube replacement maybe... . . . ."

4.0,Ok for a premium scotch

4.0,"Second tasting, different verdict.  This scotch is light in colour and flavour, but smooth and a bit like a light brandy, other than a hint of bitterness on the back of the palate.  However, it leaves a wonderful light and flowery / fruity aftertaste.  Quite enjoyable"
3.0,"Nose- Honey and hints of fruit punch. Behind all of this is a light smokiness.
Body- Smokier than the regular line of 18 year with a sweet graininess like dried unsalted peanuts. 
Nose- I have been drinking a lot of peat monsters tonight so my tasting may be affected but the finish is much lighter than I would have expected. 
Note- This is very good but the standard eighteen has more complexity and a longer, more substantial finish. For this price, I’ll take something with more complexity."

3.0,"I'm not sure if this one goes to 11, but at 47.2 I think we're going to hear this band pretty loud and clear.

This might be the only HP I've ever had that wasn't sherry finished to some degree, i'd have check on a few of those NAS's but I feel like they all had at least a bit. I also noticed some disappointing reviews lately and this gave me an excuse to go back to this one, the bottle is getting scary low but heck if you can tell easily with the stupid black bottle. 

Nose - fruity esters over vanilla and some more savory earthy/peaty elements. 

Taste - classic bourbon cask finishing up front, sweet vanilla malts. Then we transition into a more classic HP profile, with oak and smoke, and savory meaty malt notes. It never over powers with peat, but it brings out all kinds of nice oak, some sour, some sea salt. 

I'm sorry but this is for about 100 bucks and I've seen it on sale for into the 60's or 70's, this is awesome whisky for that price. I'm sure these 300 dollar, special wood casks, etc are great, but for my money they have a lot of work to pass this guy.

3 stars - keep in mind my average is a 2.0. A 3.0 is a very healthy and very strong score that I save for whisky that really should be sought out for those who appreciate it. if you like bourbon barrel finishing and like HP's malt, this is a must get, but yeah we're not into the A's or anything crazy either."
