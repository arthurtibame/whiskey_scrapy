4.0,Weird sensation! Very different from your standard whisky. Pretty good though! Smell a lot of tangerine in this whisky

4.0,"Bitter on the mid palette, slightly dry, tangy salted caramel with hints of vanilla, not a heavy Rye. Big and rich with herbed, spiced with white pepper and peppermint raisins long lingering. Would definitely buy this one!"

4.25,Priced high...but oh yeah it’s good. Sweet orange honey creamsicle. Nice rye spice in the middle but not too overpowering. Overall super tasty rye

1.75,"Nose - Smells very young, light ""gently"" aged new make rye, toasted grain sweetness, unripe pineapple

Taste - Sharp sweet young whisky, very young rye spice, lightly floral, unripe pineapple sweet/sharpness

Finish - Lingering young spirit sweetness, raw ethanol, unripe pineapple sweet/tart

Score - 48/100

Final Thoughts - This smelled like colored new make rye. Almost like they took their new make & poured it into the bottle in a heavily charred oak funnel. The super harsh new make astringency is faint, but very present. Has a nice floral/tropical fruit aspect to it, but definitely needs much more time in wood to mellow out and round things out.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
3.25,"Light and floral, short juniper finish"

4.0,"3cL Sample from Fine Drams.

Nose: cumin, toffee, tobacco, cooked apricot
Palate: Very SWEET custard. Honey and caramel. Super mild spice. This is all short lived, though.
Finish: Also Sweet, but some more smoke and heat. Lingering

Pretty unique compared to other tastes today. I think this is a cheaper bottle if in Europe & is likely worth it for a moderately older rye than stuff at a similar price point in the US."

4.0,Very tasty. Not as spicy as American Rye and almost gives off a molasses/rum finish

3.75,"My first Millstone and I must say it's an interesting dram. Xmas pudding, currents, clove and tangerine on the nose and also on the palate. The alcohol is a bit harsh but doesn't completely negate the good flavour components. I haven't had a lot of rye drams but from memory this is one of the better ones but I couldn't drink to much of it. 3.75"
