3.0,"Some sweet gum on the nose, like Juicy Fruit. After a few minutes there's more vanilla on the nose. This feels syrupy on the tongue. It's sweet (but not as sweet as the nose suggests), with a spice kick. The sometimes odd sherry flavors are there as well, but balanced. The heat is lip numbing. Given how syrupy this feels, the taste is a bit thin at first, but as the initial heat wave wears off this is layered and interesting. But for some reason it leaves me wanting one (any) aspect of the profile to punch through and dominate, but it doesn't.  7/26/17"

4.0,"I am reviewing Batch 4. Paid $69.99 @ TW.
This is an exceptional and very complex pour. As it enters you are hit with a sweet tropical note. Papaya and toffeed bananas. Once this recedes you have rich caramel and toffee. A hint of baking spices and candy corn with a lovely sweet oak on the finish. I have never had such a high proof dram (over 120 proof) that is so smooth. Lovely Dram."

3.0,Batch 005 ... It's okay. Lack of flavor to me at least.
