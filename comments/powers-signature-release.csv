3.0,"Nose: light and sweet. honey, meade like, melon, light banana and nut, light fruit - pear?

Palate: slightly watery, sweet, honey, barrel, nutty, pear?, ethanol, clove?

Finish: dry, quick, disappointing

There's some kind of light fruit(s) in here and delicious sweetness. The sweetness also seems to have some kind of clove-like spice to it. I really had to try and get these notes, instead of them being really clear and impactful. The finish was really lacking, if there even was a finish.

3.0, could be a 3.25 - tasty but unimpressive. Have definitely had better from Power's."

4.5,"The nose is gentle honey, malt, touch of oak spice, and sherry fruitiness. In the mouth it is soft and enveloping, showing what I consider to be a perfect balance of malt and grain in the pot still mash. Honey, malt, grain notes, orchard fruit, vanilla, a light touch of chocolate, a sherry depth and a sweetness fill the mouth with flavors. The sherry is in perfect balance for this single pot still, not a sherry bomb, but the perfect depth of fruit flavor to make this a nearly perfect Irish whisky. I admit I have never tasted Redbreast, Powers John Lane, or either Green or Yellow Spot; but, of the two or three dozen Irish whiskies I have tried, including a few single malts, I think this must be my favorite for balance of flavor. On the downside, I suspect this is being discontinued. I don't know this as a fact, but it is no longer listed on the Powers web site, the big stores in the KC area told me the last time they could get it was November 2018, and the online stores are either closing it out at sale prices or boosting the price on their few remaining bottles. I for one have purchased a few of the sale bottles while they are available. If you have never tried this expression, I hope you can find a bottle before they are gone---if my suspicions are correct."

4.0,"I'm loving the single pot stills and this particular iteration was done really well. Oloroso sherry casks always do their part in creating a rich whiskey and it really comes through with this one. Relative to most ""$$"" Irish Whiskey's, 4 stars may be shorting this one"

4.0,"A nice balance between a bit of bite at the front with a nice mellow finish. A bit of berry and vanilla taste as the lingering finish. Much more robust than most Irish whisky, stands up to a bit of ice."
3.0,A tad harsher on the nose and palate than the best Single Pot Still whiskeys....  Not a bad everydayer....

4.0,"This is a 3 star whisky, so why the 4 stars? The quality vs cost.  Surprisingly refreshing, you can really taste the sherry casks.  If you want a n Irish Whisky, for a low price, and don't like peat, this is a good contender. Red Breast, Yellow Spot, Greenspot are of course better,  but none can be had for $30-$35."

4.0,sharp but full of flavor
3.0,"Typical Irish whiskey flavour and spice. Light, good but not a lot of complexity. A little ruff. Similar quality to Jameson Crested. Not as smooth or rich as Redbreast 12 Year or Jameson Black Barrel. $60 in Ontario."

4.0,"If loving Powers is wrong, then  I don't want to be right - I have yet to have a disappointing whiskey from them. This is their lower priced (and NAS) single pot still offering, and while there's a hint of young spirit heat, there's plenty of smoothness and flavor to make that a forgivable offense. There's an unabashedly bourbon cask forward quality - loads of sweet vanilla and spice with hints of coconut - that accentuates the already sweet and spicy house style of single pot still. The sherry influence is more notable at the finish, as plummy dried fruit notes come through and linger alongside the vanilla and spice for a long time on the palate. Full, rich, almost creamy...this is a big dram for the price. A great introduction to single pot still whiskey for someone new the genre and not quite ready to shell out for Johns Lane or Redbreast."
