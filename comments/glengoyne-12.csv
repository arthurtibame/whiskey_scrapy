4.0,"聞起來有檸檬、焦糖和綠蘋果的味道；顏色是紅金色，喝起來有很重的木桶味道，還有甜甜的蜂蜜、水果、蘋果和大麥味。
我推薦買一瓶，慢慢享受。
There’s a little hint of lemon, caramel, and green apple on the nose. The color is a rich amber gold. A sip reveals a wood flavor along with sweet honey, fruit, apple, and malty sweetness. I recommend you get yourself a bottle and take your time enjoying it."
3.0,"Well, it’s back to working my way through the Scottish Distillery Tour group samples after taking a bit of a holiday break whilst breaking open a few new bottles of my own.  This time it’s Glengoyne 12 year old.  This one was supplied by my friend Scott, from Long Island.  It’s a Highland malt, 43% ABV and is a golden yellow in color and produces runny, oily legs in the tasting glass.

The nose is atypical of a Highland malt:  caramel & toffee apple, tropical fruits, honey sweetness with a touch of charred oak barrel shining through.  The palate starts out smooth, with some milk chocolate notes, that return back towards the nose with honey and vanilla.  The oak is restrained here because the mouthfeel turns a bit flat.  I wouldn’t call it oily, it just reminds me of a flat, soda pop type of feeling.  Let’s just say it’s the opposite of lively.  The dram kinda falls on its face here.  It’s a shame because the nose and initial sip were solid.  The finish is long and slippery, but quickly turns bitter.  A very unpleasant bitter.  Dammit.

Overall, this one just doesn’t cut the mustard when it comes to highland style single malts.  The nose starts out promising but the palate and mouthfeel don’t deliver, while the finish really kills it with the bitterness.  Thanks to @Scott_E for this sample, but I just think that you may have to climb higher into the age statement offerings here if you want to see a Glengoyne that shines.  2.75 stars.  Cheers."

3.0,"For 43%, this feels closer to 48%! A nice nose of tropical fruit, oak, sherry, and caramel. The palate brought a ton more light fruit, slight smokiness, and a nice salty caramel. The finish is short, but it is only a 12 year old. It's very reminiscent to a BenRiach 10 to me. It's a 3.5, and the theme to this dram should be ""Middle of the Road"" by the Pretenders. I am looking forward to an older Glengoyne to try, for sure. A big thanks to Scott for the sample!"

3.5,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #1.

Nose: Honey sweetness and a crisp oak presence are the outstanding characteristics. Light and sweet fruits - apple, pear, peach, apricot.

Palate: Follows on from the nose quite closely - fruity sweet, totally devoid of any smoke - Glengoyne never use pleated malt. They do, however, favour an oat cereal presence.

Finish: Fairly short, but sweet and enjoyable.

""Pleasant"" is the best word to describe this whisky. There's nothing at all bad about it and a lot to enjoy. The house character of Glengoyne is fruity sweet, but not as thickly layered as, say, Glen Moray.

There is an elegant first-fill sherry strength in the older expressions, but not here. The 12 year old is much more about the influence of Heaven Hill bourbon casks.

Good whisky at a reasonable price point, hard not to recommend, particularly for a novice who wants to try something just slightly different to the ""usual suspect"" Speysiders.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

3.0,"I purchased this one for our little tasting group.  This is one that you don’t find often on shelves and must say my interest was somewhat piqued. 

A fruity nose: apples, pears and apricots. Notes of toasted marshmallows, honeysuckle, heather, barley sugar, toffee.

Medium-weight body that arrives initially spicy of black pepper. Cream soda. Lemon zest, orange creamsicle.  Small traces of milk chocolate are sprinkled in the recesses.

This leaves the palate with black pepper, orange bitters, oak, ginger and a hint of char. 

A nice, straight forward whisky that’s easy to enjoy. A robust and inviting nose but delivers diluted flavors. The good flavors are there, but not with any emphasis. A bit more maturity would do this one well.  A nice whisky and may be a good summer sipper. [$50][85/100][Tasted: 2/17/18]"

Here's a whisky you don't come across too often, at least I don't...probably hidden in the shadows of it's other Highland brethren.  I love the nose on this:  delectable tropical fruits.  Mangoes, kiwi, Asian pear.  But seems to fall apart totally in the palette.  Shortbread and cereal...I wish that Asian pear / mango combination carried to the palette.  Great starter malt, especially for those not ready to dip into those peaty Islays or briny Islanders.  Thanks @Scott_E for the sample!"

4.0,"Stop number 55 on the SDT is Glengoyne. This Highland distillery sits just north of the Highland/Lowland borderline. The warehouses where the maturation takes place however, is actually across that border in the Lowlands. Coming in at 43% ABV, this 12 year old single malt is natural color of amber gold and is non chill filtered. 

The nose seems rather strong for 43%. Very fruity and malt forward. Oranges, apricots and green grapes. A light sherry influence with raisins and dates. Quite a bit of heather honey and barley sugar. A little vanilla but not much. Warm wood with a touch of sweet pipe tobacco and pickled ginger. A small amount of milk chocolate and salted caramels. After the first sip I’m able to pick up on mango/papaya, followed up by a quick hit of mint. A very typical Highland style nose, done fairly well. 

A somewhat restrained arrival after the nose promised something a little stronger. It tries to make a big showing but falls a little short. Perhaps another 3% ABV would have done the trick. Very fruity. Oranges, apricots, raisins. Oak and cardboard with a little toasted coconut feel. Heather honey and barley, salted caramels and a touch of pepper. Even though this is unpeated and the barley is completely air dried, I detect a faint wood smoke. Probably just my mind playing tricks on me. 

Light to medium bodied mouthfeel. A bit thin, but quite mouthwatering. 
A fairly long finish that is fruity, honeyed and dry. 

A bit of everything going on here except peat. A quintessential Highland malt. Fruity, spirit driven with the casks doing the navigating. I would give this higher marks if it was but a bit stronger. This really has the potential to be great. At the price of $54, it’s a pretty good value for money for a 12 year old. As is, I would not buy a full bottle as it’s pretty middle of the pack. Clean and well put together though. Thanks to @Scott_E for the sample. 3.75-4. 
Cheers"

Fresh sweet bubble gum and malt blend with spice and gentle barrel notes to provide a very enjoyable experience. Finishes just a tad dry and doesn't have great depth of flavor preventing even higher score. Still easily recommend . Got it on closeout for $29!!!

This Scotch whiskey is a highland single malt with lemon zest toffee apples and they say a scent of coconut. You really can tell that it is in sherrywood and bourbon barrels and it does have citrus and vanilla.  This my friends is a 12 YO single malt that is very delicious indeed! Warming, Fruity, Sherry, with a wonderful crisp Honey color. GLENGOYNE is truly delightful and worth the effort to buy n try!
The bottle reads... ""Glen of the wild goose, and Unhurried since 1833"" I agree with Unhurried... but I am not sure about the wild goose party?
Be responsible and Enjoy!

3.5,"Sis-in-law got me a bottle of this for Christmas! I’ve been looking forward to trying this one for a while. The nose offers gentle notes of heather, honeyed breakfast cereal, light vanilla, and worn leather. I get the impression of a hay bale in the sun from the nose. The palate carries these notes through to greater depth, and there is a biscuity maltiness at play that I really enjoy. More heather as well as sweeter notes are present, like dried apricots and oranges, pear crisp, and homemade cinnamon rolls. This finish is simple and yet sure of itself — sweet and malty to the end. I really like this whisky. It is what you’d hope a Glenlivet would be and what a Glenfiddich is trying to approach. And though it lacks the complexity or finesse of a Glen Garioch, like a Dalwhinnie it is confident in its simplicity."
