1.0,"Another new distillery that needs to keep this stuff in the barrels for a few more years.  As much as you want to support the little guy, without the quality it's hard to want to purchase this again."
1.0,"Going to the back of the cabinet, don't think I could give this stuff away."
4.0,"Koval in general is doing a fine job out of Chicago. As far as the four grain goes, if anyone wants Pappy at the right price, switch over to this hidden gem."

4.0,On the nose the whiskey is full of bay leaves and marjoram. The spice blend reminds me of a high end tea store as you sniff. As you chew the whiskey it shows an over developed flavor for its age. The whiskey is extremely smooth and easily palatable for a 2 year 94 proof. I would keep this in my collection for an easy drinker.

1.0,"Tastes like vodka injected with, maybe, artificial cinnamon?"
5.0,"Dry, herby, spicy and very special, but amazing, creamy and lemony, I have never had a whisky like it and it's a shame others aren't so keen on it."

4.0,Nice sweet mouthfeel fades into nice oak and herbal flavors. Ends with a smokey taste that lingers around. Nice and smooth.

5.0,"Super sweet on the nose.  Initially notes of brown sugar, and bananas.  Those notes carry through to the end. Taste is smooth and matches the notes.  Very easy to drink.  This is as smooth as my go to 18 year old scotch.  Will def continue to purchase."

2.25,"Nose:
Granny Smith apple
Oily, like a pot still Irish or an oily single malt
Whole wheat bread
Light yeast notes
Little bit of caramel and vanilla
Intense aroma, hard to nose

Palate:
Barrel sweetness rushes around the palate
Leads to a long barrel tannin finish
Oakiness, like furniture
Spice

Barrel tannins are overwhelming, which is a shame because I like the nose on this whiskey.  The oiliness reminded me of the Koval millet whiskey, which I actually liked a lot.  As usual with Koval products, it could use a lot longer in the barrel."
