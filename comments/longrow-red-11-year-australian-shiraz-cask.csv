3.75,"Pours the color of engine oil. First impressions on the nose are of a dry red wine, with slightly sweet background layers and a delicate perfume note; nothing overpowering or out of place. The palate needs a few drops of water to tame the alcohol and separate the flavors of treacle syrup, tannins and a dash of peppery peat. It’s pleasantly thick and oily. So far, so good, but it’s the aftertaste where it really shines, evoking cherries covered in dark chocolate and extending for many minutes into a dry finish. It’s a satisfying drink to sip slowly on a fall night, though I think the 13-year-old Malbec was a more impressive entry in the Red series."
