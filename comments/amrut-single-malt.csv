3.25,Very pleasurable first India whiskey tasting. Tropical fruit subtle sweet smell that’s very nice. Ethanol heat stands out upon chewing.  More hints of sweet and heat to finish. Pretty smooth enjoyable finish.  Will be looking for the peated version. Nice pour. Thank James

2.0,"Nose: Promising barley which is somehow lost in the taste. Mixed with nutty notes and some citrus fruits and banana.
Taste: Spices with fruit. The barley is there but not quite as good as in the nose. Touch of honey and apricot with small amounts of spices.
Finish: Malt with some sweetness and green fruits. Feel of rum is nicely in the aftertaste but fades away too quickly.
Balance: Interesting, vibrant dram – shows potential. Probably too fruity and undone for my taste. Would be nice to taste this whisky with more years in the casks."

3.0,"I think I liked the Fusion better than this expression, but maybe that's because the Fusion is a little sweeter which may disguise the lower age. Can't argue with barley from the Himalayas though. Say that at a party and people will notice. Good little dram though. And it's always nice to have single malts from other regions other than Scotland (ya, I said it)."

4.0,"Another interesting Indian experience. Pleasant nose - honey and fruits. But the taste is really unique - at first vanilla ice cream, which slowly fades and is replaced by aromatic spices. And then comes the finish. Rather short but again different - with pepper and - how come? - Indian spices?
     Very good, interesting whiskey. And definitely worth it's price. (135PLN)"

3.0,"What an inscrutable single malt. The aroma is full of oak and earthy spices, while the palate is floral, cereal-like (oatmeal), fruit-forward (banana), and reminiscent of dry grass. The finish burns hot, making sense of this tropical malt's youth, and is musty and woody."

1.0,"Mildly sweet... then dry and finishing with a horrible alcohol burn... The flavour was also cruelly simple. Maybe it's not my style... maybe it's just a really bad whisky.
If you want Indian, go for Paul John Edited and at the very least, Amrut Fusion is a better Amrut whisky."

4.0,"After a few minutes in the glass this has a wonderful nose of warm caramel. The taste is sweet, slightly fruity and spicy, all at the same time. Great bourbony qualities. A nice light, slightly oaky finish. This is a young whisky with loads of character. The first Indian whisky I’ve ever tried and it’s very, very accomplished indeed."

4.0,"Light oak and faint notes of malted cereal on the nose. Palate is fairly robust, however, with a bold (yet uncomplicated) combination of orchard fruit, honey and vanilla. The finish is smooth, fruity and of medium-length. Tasty and easy-drinking. I'm quite impressed."

3.0,"Well, we're not in Kansas anymore, that's for sure. The uniqueness of the dram make the case that climate and terroir account for at least some of the personality of a given whiskey. Whether it's the Indian malt, the hot climate, or some other factor, this stands out. Toasty, dry malt, drizzled with wildflower honey with a certain salinity (reminds me of a mouthwash I once was prescribed for gingivitis) and sandalwood notes. I don't know that I love this, but it's certainly its own creature, and I can at least appreciate that."

2.75,"Indian whisky has never been very high on my list, but curiosity finally convinced me to give Amrut's core range bottling a try. Fresh citrus, vanilla and a touch of oak spice offer a pleasant but rather simple nose. Green apples, mango and sweet malt linger in the back. The palate reminds of a misbehaving teenager: young, immature and not very harmonic, I am struggling to enjoy this dram. Lemon, ginger and some bitter green tea rescue the medium finish. I know there are better versions of Amrut available, but where is the 'Indian identity', I wonder?

3.0,"A really interesting whiskey. So many different fresh fruits kicking around and nice sweetness throughout, but there is something odd and unbalance there, a taste almost like artificial banana flavour with aspartame."
3.5,"I had the good fortune to attend an Amrut tasting event tonight with one of the brand ambassadors at the Seven Grand whiskey bar in downtown Austin. I got to try five different expressions from Amrut over the course of the evening, plus some delightful punch made with their peated single malt.

This bottle is their standard offering. It ranked number 5 overall of the evening, but that by no means makes it a bad whisky. There's a roundness and creaminess to the malt from the Indian barley, and the taste almost reminds me of Dalwhinnie, with its honey, floral sweetness. A fine pour, and I wouldn't say no if someone offered it to me."

3.0,"Sweet, molasses nose. Ultra spicey on the front of the tongue, which settles down after a second. Smooth finish with a tingly undertone as the spice leaves your mouth. Aftertaste is pleasantly sweet and sits between your cheeks on the sides of the tongue."

3.5,"46% abv
non chill-filtered
natural color

Nose: bright fruits (apple, strawberry and pear) along with honey and lemon-lime. Young and punchy. 

Taste: Honey-sweet and tart (think green apple tart) with a medium body. As it develops, the lime note returns along with pepper and milk chocolate, and you get some of the bourbon ask notes. such as caramel and cinnamon, but they play a complementary role.

Finish: A tad hot, with tobacco, cinnamon, a bit of oakiness and tangy tartness.

Value: at $50-60 USD, this one is a toss up.

Final thoughts: A young whisky to be sure, Amrut single malt is none-the-less a unique and complex pour which portends good things to come with more age. Give this one a try (or one of the others in their lineup) and enjoy this very singular whisky experience. 

Final Score: 3.5/5 (Recommend trying or buying a bottle at a good price)

3.0,"Interestingly honey sweet nose. Agree with the honey toast note. Overall interesting and intriguing but not mind blowing for an international whiskey. Balanced. Could mistake it for a Highland Scotch in blind tasting.

N: honey sweet, fruity

P: candied fruit, dessert like, smooth, milk chocolate, bready/nutty

F: fruit, short, sweet with a little burn on the back"

4.0,"Very interesting dram. Different, full of flavor, great aroma, beautiful experience. 

On the nose is very pleasant, Prune peel, Vanilla, Alcohol notes are present which makes me believe it is younger than 12 years old, it has no age statement. Lots of Caramel syrup, Medicinal plants and very Perfumed (as if it were older than 18 years) 

There is a hidden peat somewhere that shows itself for seconds then hides. Very complex on the nose, very appealing, interesting, almost THRILLING.

ON THE PALATE IT IS A DIFFENT DRAM. AS INDIAN FOOD, INDIAN WHISKY. the nose tells you sweet, and starts sweet on the palate for a moment then a burning hotness starts, not your usual hotness, is like gasoline, or kerosene, with explosions of spicyness like red chillis, ""ají cholo"" as we say in Ecuador, and black pepper. 

Very spicy ultra hot and burning (46%abv) the finish is medium full of spices, like taking a spoon of red hot chilli peppers (nice rock band too).

Light bodied but full of flavor. Burns a lot but in a pleasant way (not like arran 14). If you chew it you will find something that resembles wheat or bread, caramel and then this amazing spicyness. Changing evolving flavors in your mouth i got to say it is a wonderful experience. I wouldn't use it for a drinking party night, i would use it as a starter for mexican food.

Amber colour, non chill filtered, beautiful story behind the name of the brand, a very recommended whisky for a change"

Aujourd'hui, c'est la dernière journée d'une magnifique année de travail. Après avoir festoyé à l'Inox en après-midi, me voici à la maison avec une bonne poutine du Pierrot accompagnée de ce magnifique whisky. C'est si succulent en bouche que je crois rêver. J'en oublie rapidement la poutine pour mieux apprécier ce breuvage sublime. Je vais certainement m'en acheter une bouteille."
