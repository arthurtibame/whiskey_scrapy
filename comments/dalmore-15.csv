3.75,"If you had to look at the color of the whisky, the result of so much coloring, you would say no: the final aging of 3 years in ex-Sherry casks (Amoroso, Apostoles and Matusalem Oloroso) is certainly what they want to evoke with its inviting ruby red, a parlor trick.
The nose at least is consistent, immediately discovering the sherried finish in an elegant way, combined with hints of orange and ripe fruit. The waxy aroma is remarkable, just from freshly polished wood, which blends everything. Sweet but delicate.
On the palate the sweetness becomes more pronounced, with caramel and fruit tart, combined with raisins and woody hints. Very sweet, perhaps even too much, to the point that at certain moments it seems to recognize cola: some more alcohol content would have perhaps made it more balanced, who knows. So instead it seems to have the handbrake pulled, ready to bloom but stuck right there (a whisky interruptus, in short).
The finish is not very long, caramelized and sweet (and, yes, still with a pinch of cola)."

4.0,"[Re-Review 030416] - Strong and commanding nose comprising of mildly raspberry sweetness.  There is a nice rich delivery of citrus orange that lends itself to this pure scotch.  Continuing with soft honey with consecutive samplings.  The finish exemplifies dry and woody red wine.  However, there are other highland malts that have a little extra bite and richness.  In the end I do believe this is highly recommendable if you would like to experience something above a 12 year old expression, if you have the means.  P.S. I do think this is highly overpriced."

4.0,"Wow can immediately sense there's something else going on here. Can definitely taste the wine finishing, it works together with the sherry in perfect harmony. It's got a lovely velvety mouthfeel, and it's soft and gentle. It's actually a very good whisky I'm pleasantly surprised. One thing though it's SUPER sweet. Reminds me of the Quinta ruban. I'd rate it higher if it was cheaper and bottled at a higher abv, the dalmore 15 reminds me of a Quinta ruban but more refined. I'd wish it was bottled at a higher abv though. Overall it's a good whisky, will satisfy anyone looking for a twist and likes super sweet flavours"

4.0,"Having finished my bottle of Dalmore 12 year old way back in February of 2016 I feel it's long past due to experience the next step in the Dalmore range.  I have every bottle in the yearly Dalmore range:  from this 15, the 18, cigar malt, King Alex III to the hefty priced 25 year old.  I kept telling myself I'd open them all side-by-side one day and just do a Dalmore tasting.  I realize now that is crazy, so I'll just start from the bottom and work my way up.  Eventually.

The 15 year old is their 12 year old ex-bourbon barrel juice thats finished in 3 different sherry casks for the final 3 years, then blended and bottled at the usual 80 proof.  I paid around $110 for this 750ml back in March at my local liquor store.  A little searching and I see you can find this bottle online now for around $75-85.  Dammit.

It's a deep, dark copper in the glass and giving it a swirl makes it cling to the sides while not producing many legs at all.  A bit oily.  The nose is a robust blast of chocolate covered oranges and cherries and sweet, sweet sherry.  Most of the oak and vanilla notes are well hidden, which is a bit of a surprise considering it spent 12 years in ex-bourbon casks.  Over time, about 10 minutes now, the zesty oak is peeking through...

The first sip reveals more of the chocolate and orange flavors that are nicely balanced with the cinnamon and peppery oak.  It feels very rich, but not oily at all.  It finishes very smooth with a wash of toffee and malt before warming you up with oak spices.

It's a very enjoyable dram.  There's enough spices to add another dimension of flavor that's not found in other higher end Sherry-finished whiskies like Macallan and Balvenie.  I'm truly looking forward to going deeper into Dalmore's core range if they all have promise like this 15 year old.  If you prefer your sherry finished whisky with a bit more of a kick then give this one a go.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Cheers and Happy Holidays, my friends."

3.0,"I received a sample in a gift set and was very eager to try it. Perhaps my expectations were set a bit too high, or maybe it is an off night, but I was a little disappointed. Don't misunderstand me; the dram was not bad, and was in fact somewhat enjoyable, but for me it fell a bit flat, especially given the $99 price tag locally for 750 mL. 

The nose was very pleasant, with notes of candied pecans, brown sugar, and trail mix fruits. Later, as it sat, notes of wine, like a good merlot, could be found. The palate was not particularly sweet, but had a nuttiness foretold by the aroma.  The finish was short, dry, and a tad hot for a 15 year at a moderate ABV. Nothing really lingered on the palate. 

Dry glass:  mixed nuts. 

Pleasant, and certainly inoffensive, but not interesting enough, in my opinion, to warrant the price tag. For my money, the Balvenie 12-year Double Wood is one example of a similarly drinkable whisky that does much less damage to the pocketbook."

3.0,"I bought a bottle of this relatively cheaply from memory ~ $85 mark. It looked the part but man trying to get flavour out of it was like getting blood out of stone. The bottle was soon given away....in the early days I prob drank less than 20% of what I bought...the average stuff got given away pretty quick and the good stuff shared. Was a very expensive way of trying stuff so now I nearly always try before I buy. Very rare exceptions are distilleries I love, others I trust highly reviewing the bottle and generally FOMO. Case in point the Kilchoman 2018 Portwood just out (you will be mine someday soon when you land on NZ shores...) Anyhow I've cracked open a Cigar Malt sample right now so it bought back (not so fond) memories of this drop. The Cigar Malt itself is for another review. :-)"

3.5,"Nose: Sherry with orange, berry, spice notes and butterscotch.  A hint of anise and way more than just a hint of rum – a very Christmas pudding aroma.

Palate: Fruitcake, orange peel, sultanas – lighter than the nose would make you expect, but still very sherry and raisin driven.

Finish: Surprisingly short but smooth. Milk chocolate in the aftertaste.

From the very first time I tasted one, I’ve never really warmed to Dalmore whiskies. They are always polished, rounded and undoubtedly of high quality but I can never escape the feeling that they are over-engineered.

They are seldom actually bad (although a bit too much sulphur can creep in from time to time), but I never feel excited or impressed by them. The abv is generally low, they are highly coloured, chill-filtered and way over-priced. This 15 year is the same price as Glenfarclas 15, Springbank 15 or Old Pulteney 17 and I’d take any of those in preference anytime.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"

3.0,"After a work related Christmas dinner I had the chance to taste The Dalmore 15. My expectations were high, as The Dalmore was one of my most anticipated on brands since I got interested in whisky - partly because of the hype around the brand - but, since my preferences started to lean towards peated whiskies early on, The Dalmore dropped lower on my Wishlist. 
I’m going to confess right from the start that I found The Dalmore 15 to be an absolutely outstanding dram, from the Nose to the finish, but at the same time I feel The Dalmore is a bit over-hyped. I had a similar thoughts and experiences with The Macallan I tasted in Italy last year, though. 
The Dalmore 15 has perfect balance, a full, round body and I liked the caramel peanuts in the palate as well as the obvious the sherrycask-influences, but this 15 year old didn’t ‘wow’ me very much at all. The finish was ok though and lingers on quite a while, especially it’s sweetness. 
All in all it’s certainly not a bad dram, and I’ll try other expressions and ages of The Dalmore whenever I’ll get the chance to, but it the expectations will be a lot lower next time."

4.0,"My 2nd Dalmore in the taster tonight. After having tasted the 12Y some time ago, the 15Y is next.
First a funny fact about Dalmore. The distillery was founded in 1839 by a guy who made his fortune with the opium trade.
A little less funny is the fact that Dalmore master blender Patterson, thinks that he needs to caramel colour his baby's and dilute this and others to a meagre 40%.
I do like his idea of creating a blend with 3 different sherry finishes though. Matusalem/Apostoles and Amaroso casks.

On the nose I got sweet berrie & cherrie and lots of orange. The presence of sweet sherry is obvious, but the smell of stepping into a flower shop surprised me a bit. A chocolate bitterness finishes this pleasant nosing.

On the palate a bit sharper with alcohol than expected with it's 40%. 
Oranges and sherry deliver the fruity part here, where cinnamon and pepper take care off the spices. Burnt brown sugar and a hint of bitter almond made this one complex and well rounded.

The medium slight oaky dry and nutty bitter finish, luckily has a lot of toffee, raisin and orange sweetness to compensate the bitter and dry parts.

After rating the 12Y with 84 points, i had high expectations of this one. But sadly I was a bit underwhelmed with this Dalmore.
My score is 80 points.

Palate: Light,thin,sherry, small fruit, earthy, mineral.
Finish: Dry oak, bitter.

Least favorite of the samples."

En bouche, c'est léger et tout aussi caramélisé, avec des arômes de bois mais surtout de fruit cuit.
La finale est longue et agréable."
4.0,Smooth finish
2.75,High end of grade. Wasn’t a good test as it was 2nd drink of night. Lack luster. Ex bourbon and sherry barrels. Highlands
3.75,"Loads of moist ginger cake on the nose, smooth mouthfeel, very fruity flavours, spicy, slightly citrus finish which sadly leaves too soon. Good entry dram for whisky newcomers, would be legendary if the finish was a bit longer and more interesting."

3.75,"Whisk(e)y: The Dalmore 15

Nose:

A subtleness of blackberry, current and cherry.  It spends 12years in ex-bourbon casks and then the final 3 years in amoroso, matusalem and apostles. The final three years definitely gives this more depth and appreciation.

Palate:

Not as bountiful as the Dalmore 12, but distinguishes itself from being three years senior. It has a slight sense of dried berries which is welcomed on the mid to back palate.

Overall: 

This is a solid scotch. Dalmore always has robust flavours in their products. I would recommend buying the 12 year over this but if you collect you may find it difficult to appreciate between the two unless you give equal time between the two variations to understand each of the different casks it lies in. It’s a great dram worth buying at the bar. You will not be displeased if you have never had dalmore. No burn, smooth as silk, but different from the robust 12 version. Worth purchasing and collecting.

Cheers,"

3.75,"Nose : The nose is marked by a bitter sweetness, full of orange and vanilla and spices, and a very slight touch of apple.

Taste : Taste is similar, with added presence of oak and a little bit sweeter.

Finish : Finish is strong but short. Really sweet, but more than the rest of the experience."

3.25,"Grape component like a Cognac, incredibly so. Buttery and full of sugary-sweet notes. Tiramisu. The nose is straight caramel and burnt sugar. The fusels are no joke, but the sweetness is a counterpoint. It's not my favorite at this nascent stage of Scotch appreciation, to be frank, but I see what it is. Definitely a cousin of Cognac."

4.0,"The nose has some dark bread notes a hint of tobacco and some funky sherry notes.  Wood spice cedar and cinnamon.  Maybe a faint hint of dried dates.  The palate has some tobacco, dark chocolate, dates.  The dark bread is back.  The finish is long and astringent.  There are slight hints of bitter chocolate and a faint whisper of raisins off to the side.  There is tobacco and pepper spice in the finish.

The mouthfeel is oily and thick.  It's quite oily.

The only thing negative that I can say about this is that I was hoping for a stronger sherry influence, but all in all, it's a fine whiskey with a lot of personality and a reasonable degree of complexity.  It's fairly robust for a 40%, but I think this could easily go to a 43% or even better a 46% and that would bring out more boldness."

4.0,"There is an spanish song that says: ""there is a guy who is dissapointed at the Godfather part 2"" well, i am kind of dissapointed about this dram. I love The Dalmore, i love everything about it. I have had the 12yo, the Valour, The regalis, all incredible drinks. This one is an excelent elegant dram, but doesn't quite live to my expectations for it.

Bottled at 40%abv, with a reddish amber color.

On the nose is very beautiful, promising lots of good things on the palate. Liquorice, toasted caramel, creme brulee, oranges and brown sugar notes are the main aroma.

On the palate is too elegant and fancy, and that is not necessarily a good thing. Ultra smooth, with a solid sherry note, caramel, brown sugar and the dissapointing short tobacco finish. Expected a lot more. Fancy and elegant but not exciting.

Overall i give this one an 84 over 100, the lowest score for my dalmores. Still a great dram, but dalmore can do a lot better."

3.75,"Nose you can really tell the age on this expression in fact I'd say it was older if I was poured this blind. The round edges, the sherry factor and the leathery oak notes are high in this whisky. The grain note is a slight bit dark and musty so the whisky is very malty. Classic Dalmore/sherry cask notes of raisin, ripe plum, chocolate, honey, pear, orange preserve, touch of caramel (once opened up the caramel becomes a sugary syrup note) slight highland flower and heather floral hiding in back you have to search it out. Palate has sweet breakfast cereal malt, honey, vanilla, caramel syrup, dark raisins, plums, hint of black currant, spice (clove, allspice, cinnamon) oily consistency, sweet apple, strong orange citrus, light oak tannin bitterness to cut the sweetness. Finish is a long medium from the oils. Classic waxy nutty walnut and oak linger longest, but finish also with the apple, orange and syrup sweetness hanging on to the front half on the finish but fades away. Only things keeping this one from 4-5 stars are chill filtering, color added and low ABV. This is 4X better than the 12 year old for 2X the price; even less on a good sale/clearance where I got mine for the price I list. Normal MSRP is $120. I wouldn't make this my daily drinker but I find myself going to it as a after dinner or when I'm in the mood for a quality sherry finish whisky."
