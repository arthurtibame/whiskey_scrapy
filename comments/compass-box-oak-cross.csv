4.0,Not a bad blended malt.  Citrus and polish in the nose.  The palate is a little sweet with a sort of beeswax feel and flavor coupled with some light citrus and vanilla. Some notes of wood spice pop on the tongue.  Doesn't seem super complex but is pretty nice overall.

4.0,"This is a great whisky, but I prefer the Great King Street Artist's Blend:
  Firstly, the blend of oaks isn't quite right, the French oak is very creamy, but overpowered by the American oak's spice; in French whisky, the French oak takes centre stage and in Great King Street, the sherry cask and the single grain leaves the French oak room to breath and express itself (and the sherry spice subtly layers those spicy notes).
  I also miss what Girvan had to offer in Great King Street Artist's Blend, somehow the rawness of the single grain adds something important to the mix."

4.0,"My first impression drinking this with Cascode remains. This is a loverly expression of wood and how it can be expressed in whisky. There is an understated elegance here that can be so easily overlooked. The nose is vanilla, subtle wood and bananas. The taste is light bodied fruit and oak tannin - finish is light spice. Smooth and clean as we've come to expect from Compass Box. Its overshadowed by its bigger dare I say brasher brothers and sisters in the Compass Box range. This is not a dram to compare but to savour. If you want to do some trainspotting best not stop here. Loverly stuff and kind of unique. I first gave this 3 stars but by the end of the glass I raised this 4 stars and 92."
2.0,"There is just way too much nail polish remover or young spirit character in the nose of this blend.  The better aspects are like a light Highland malt, with a tiny bit of green grape and apple, and a healthy, fibrous wood.  The palate is extremely woody again but also a little sour; licorice and ginger are the only two other flavors I note here.  The finish is quite bitter, ranging from green grass to fresh wood; to its credit, it is long, but it has a surprising amount of bite at this low proof.  If tasted blind, I would have assumed this was a young well whiskey, so I'm not impressed.  The only other Compass Box blends I've had are Great King Street and Asyla, which are a lot better and cheaper.  Pass on Oak Cross."

3.0,"Been meaning to try more Compass Box whiskies after enjoying the Great King St. range. I’m also a big fan of Compass Box's graphic design as a creative professional. I wish I could buy framed prints of the labels.
  
Nose: Bananas right off the bat, the caramelized bananas note from Stephanie is dead accurate. Vanilla gelato, some honey and cake frosting is revealed the longer it's in the glass. Not the most pungent but it’s all in there.
  
 Taste: Light bodied, spicy cinnamon and white pepper hits first, than honey sweetness. A bit scarce on the flavor and I expected more based on the nose.
  
  Finish: Spiced oak leads into a very sweet but short finish with little bitterness and not much complexity.
  
  Overall this is an excellent blended scotch that would make an nice daily dram. My problem with it lies in the price. At almost $60 after taxes there are far too many single malts I’d rather drink instead. Solid but forgettable."

3.0,"Maybe the bar was set low having just tried the Asyla but this was definitely a step up. Reminds me of a thinner bodied irish pot still whisky. Now I'm not going to get carried away and start waxing lyrically as it has a slight astringency and its not nearly in the same class as a Redbreast, Powers or really any decent Irish pot still given it lacks the viscosity but at least this 50ml sample in the gift box selection is heading in the right direction. Definitely wouldn't buy a bottle"
3.0,"If you can smell bananas and Chinese five spices, you're a wizard and deserve to work for the great perfume houses in Paris, because this whisky has one of the most underwhelming bouquets I've ever come across. It's basically light oak aromas with a hint of fruit, so long as you're willing to allow your imagination to run free. The palate itself is wood spices with a touch of char. All very nice but all very weak. As for the finish... what finish? It all came and went so soon."

3.0,"33 open bottles in my collection ranked through multiple blind tastings.  Counting them down!

#31: Compass Box Oak Cross.  Blended Malt.  43% ABV.  NAS.
Paid $35
Even though $35 was a fantastic sale price, I can’t see myself purchasing another bottle.

This is a boring Compass Box.  I adore Compass Box as a brand, but this particular offering was average.  It’s very quaffable, just not memorable.  I recommend letting this one rest for a while.  Pour it, and do something else.  Initially, the dram is muddled.  After 20-30 minutes, the floral notes and orchard fruits take the lead.  On the palate, it is light and fruity with a quick transition the spiciness provided by the French oak heads Frankenstein’d onto American oak staves (hence the name).  This may impress the newcomer, but not me.  The finish is medium and uninteresting.

MARK: 78/100

PREVIOUSLY, ON BATMAN:
#32: Johnnie Walker Black Lable.  $36.  40%.  12 years.  71/100.

3.0,"Review from Barreled from November 2016

Part two of the Compass Box Whisky sampler pack reviews. 

This blended malt scotch whisky has no age statement but I read that all components are at least 10 years old. Oak Cross gets its name from the custom hybrid casks being used made with virgin French oak heads and first fill American oak staves. It is composed of 60% northern Highland single malt, 20% Highland single malt, and 20% Speyside single malt. As are all CBW whiskies, it is natural color and non chill filtered. This one is a nice golden color and is 43% ABV. 

The nose is heavy with ripe red fruits and oak spices. Vanilla, toffee, and some clove. Sweet berries and maybe some pineapple candy. A hint of toasted coconut. Every time I picked up the glass to nose it I got an initial smell of melted butter that quickly faded into oak. 

On the palate there are plenty of oak spices as to be expected. Toffee, vanilla, caramel. Some bourbon sweetness from the American oak.  The French oak is definitely there as well with more intensity. Lightly fruity but not much. There was a brief and fleeting mint/menthol note as well. Creamy mouthfeel. 

The finish is medium short and is very oaky. 

I immediately compared this blend to the Glenlivet 15 YO French Oak Reserve. This one is fruitier and the American oak give more of a sweetness, but the French oak notes are very similar. Both display high quality oak casks. Overall, it's not an exceptional whisky, but for a blend it's very good. Easy to drink and good for any occasion. 3.5
Cheers"

3.0,"Paid $35 for this bottle.
This is a bottle kill review.  I will try to summarize what this bottle offered.

I found this on sale.  The normal price will be around $40-60.
This is a decent whisky.  I would get it again if I can find it for $40 or less.  Otherwise, for entry level Compass Box, I would stick with their King Street offerings.  For a few bucks more, Spice Tree is great.
Nose: young, fruity and floral.  A tad too much acetone.  Yes, there is oak.
Palate: malty, orchard fruits.  In the back, there is some older stuff adding a delicate oily hibiscus.  Yes, there is oak.
Finish: spiciness picks up.  Pretty standard.  Cloves and cinnamon.  Light honey and citrus.  Yes, there is oak.
Pros: You get a lot of complexity for the price
Cons: The oak is actually not what unbalances this; it’s that too-young acetone note.

Slightly cheaper, similar profile, and recommended: Deanston Virgin Oak
Slightly costlier, similar profile, and recommended: Balvenie 12 year Single Barrel First Fill
Final Mark: 79/100 (range 77-82.  N = 5)"

3.5,"Nose: Fruity and fragrant, with honey, vanilla, banana and peaches all apparent. There are also herbal and cereal aromas and, surprisingly, only a moderate oak presence.

 Palate: The arrival is a whole bowl of fruit salad, toasted muesli, nuts and cream dressed with mellow spices. Quite gentle and delicate and again there is a restrained oak touch.

Finish: Medium/long. The palate merges slowly into the aftertaste.

The foundation is solid and very fine oak which gives structure and purpose to what might otherwise be an over-sweet dram.  The oak presence is a focus, but not an unbalancing one.

This whisky is precisely positioned between Asyla and Spice Tree in character - the soft, light and luscious waxy flavours of Asyla and hints of the robust fullness of Spice Tree.

I like it and it is good value. It is more expensive than many other blends, but you're getting a premium product intended for sipping. Try tasting some of the mainstream blends after this and you'll immediately see how dull, syrupy and lifeless a lot of them are - even the good ones.

Actually the biggest competition against this whisky is Compass Box's own Spice Tree, which is bigger in just about every respect and much the same price, but this maybe has the edge if you prefer a little less spice and more of a cereal personality.

Today I had my first dram of Oak Cross from my nearly full bottle since that date. Wow, the time and a little breathing has really enriched this. Honey notes are much more distinct now and the softness of it in your mouth is nearing volumptousness. Not as fruity as the Glen 10, but really, really good."

Nose: Sweet and fruity, apricot, and citrus, spices, with a background cereal note.

Flavor: Fruits up front, apricot, citrus, clove, anise, baking spices, floral background notes, vanilla as well.

Finish: A lot of spices but nothing that jumps out at me specifically.  Medium finish fading in to a heavy oak.

My second favorite Compass Box item that I've tried.  Nothing super exciting here and a little bit watery but nice.  I wouldn't buy a bottle but I wouldn't turn down an offer of a drink either."

4.5,"I'm upping my previous review of a 4.0 for a few reasons. The other night I was feeling like a lighter dram and poured myself a generous measure of Oak Cross. After consuming said dram, I remembered that this bottling is what's listed as the ""vatted Highland malt"" on CBW's recipes, and a part of this whisky is in all their other whiskies as well, so naturally I poured myself a bit of Peat Monster to test this theory, and lo and behold, having had Oak Cross first amplified the taste of Peat Monster! 

I tried the same procedure with Spice Tree the next night, and The Spaniard the night after that. Having Oak Cross as a ""warmup"" to the other CBW offerings made all the others more enjoyable!

While this one isn't their best offering (keeping in mind that when these guys have a bad day it looks like a good day at most other places...), it cuts right to the core of what John Glasser is going for in his quest for whisky ""deliciousness"", and therefore my rating for this one gets a boost and a hearty salute."

Bottled at 43%abv, with a pale staw-pale gold color.

On the nose is the most fruity dram i have ever had, easy to detect, great for starters in this tasting business. Caramel and hay was my first impression, then pear, apple juice, fresh lemons and finally some cream.

On the palate is a little normal (boring), with oranges and spices, a mild hotness and a medium spicy finish. 

Overall i give this dram an 87 over 100. It is a blended Malt, important fact. Cheers!"

4.0,"For those of you playing along at home, I've been working my way through the Compass Box's core range of blended malt whiskys. My local liquor store was having its annual liquidation sale, and I picked this up for next to nothing. The price listed was the regular retail, but I got it for about $21. Bless you Texas liquor laws, and bless Compass Box whisky.

This is a much more subtle whisky than its burlier cousins, Spice Tree and Peat Monster. It takes time to get to know it. Maybe it's shy. Or maybe it's just trying to figure itself out, since it is a seamless blend of single malts aged separately in refill American oak casks and new French oak casks, then blended together. It's a similar process that CBW uses for Spice Tree, but with less casks and less toasting/charing of said casks.

At first sniff, I get vanilla, and quite a bit, but not an overbearing amount of oak (Duh...). You have to let this one sit on the palate a while, and when you do, you get more vanilla and oak, as well as a light, nondescript fruity taste, a creamy mouthfeel, and a warm, slow finish that lingers with more vanilla and oak (are you sensing a trend here?). I haven't tried this one with food yet, but I suspect that it won't hold up the same way some of the other CBW expressions might, but as an aperitif whisky, or even a desert whisky, sign me up! I wonder what it would taste like over vanilla ice cream...?"
