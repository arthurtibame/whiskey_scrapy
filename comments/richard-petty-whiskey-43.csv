0.5,This made me sick by one sip.  It taste nothing like whiskey I’ve ever had. For 8 Bucks I would rather have Canadian Mist.

1.5,"As a fan of Richard Petty, I bought this VA ABC Closeout more for the bottle than for the whiskey. I opened it with low expectations and wasn’t surprised . It pours very light. There are notes of corn and paint thinner on the nose. The mouthfeel is thin, but astringent. After all this is a 2 year old blend, bottled as a “80th birthday tribute” to NASCAR’s King. I’ll just say I’m glad I got it for half price, but it’s still not a real bargain. Though I prefer my whiskey neat, this will probably wind up mixed."
