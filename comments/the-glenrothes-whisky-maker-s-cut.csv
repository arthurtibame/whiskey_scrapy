2.0,"Another ""90"" eh? 

Nose is vanilla and sweet sherry. There's a bitter oak note here as well, a bit off putting and giving me lingering feelings of young raw whisky. I even get what could be a hair of banana. 

Taste - Citrus fruit, creamy milk chocolate, some dark fruits, spices, and young oak on the back end. 

Overall this is a pretty run of the mill NAS sherry whisky. I think the casks are decent. The ABV is a really nice place where I think most will be able to go right in drinking but adding water is perfectly acceptable as well. Yes it's a bit sparky and young, but it's 75 bucks and I think it's hitting a sweet spot between the spice and sweet notes. 

2 stars, very average whisky. I think those who enjoy younger whisky will find this more like a 3 star and the price while I would still say it is a bit high it's getting hard to be critical of a bottle at an ok proof, with sherry casks, under 100 bucks today."

2.5,"향 : 옅은 알콜향, 빨간건과일, 보리곡물향
맛 : 쉐리 < 스파이시 강조, 미들 오일리, 깊은 쉐리도 아닌, 온전한 플로랄도 아닌, 
피니쉬 : 약간 더 알콜향, 마른오크통

전체적으로 알콜향이 조금 더 느껴져서 아쉬운 느낌, 맥캘란과 글렌고인의 아쉬운 점 그 중간 어디쯤.."

3.75,"Nose: Floral and sweet, but too overpowering. A touch of wood. Sharp on the end.

Palette: Burnt butter? 

Finish: Honey and citrus. Alcohol lingers. 

A nice but not exemplary whisky. As it is a NAS, it still seems young and would have benefitted from a bit more maturation."

4.25,"I am always on the lookout for a solid well Sherried Whisky and was intrigued when this one first popped up at my local Costco. It's typically priced for between $90-$100 in my market so when Costco dropped the price to $59.99 I decided there was enough value to pull the trigger on it. 
Now I personally have never had anything from Glenrothes so I had no frame of reference for what to expect, but let's dive into what we know about this specific bottle:

1) It's an NAS release (according to friend who got info from a distributor it's believed to be around 16yrs old)
2) It's bottled at an interesting 48.8% abv
3) It's exclusively aged in first fill ex-sherry casks 
4) It's non chill filtered and natural colour (really nice colour on it too)

Let's dive into the tasting:

Right upon entry you know you are dealing with a quality and classic sherried whisky. Plums, raisins, orange peel and dark chocolate covered peanuts. It's really mouthcoating and has a lovely oily texture. Mid palette adds tobacco, oak spice and leather. Finish is long with the heat kicking in with a cherry cake, spiced raisins and a good dose of oak. It's mouthwatering. Really easy to drink! I love the proof they selected as I think it's perfect for this dram. 

From a comparison standpoint it think this one is better then both the Aberlour A'bundah and the Oloroso Nadurra. It's got a good amount of complexity and for the price I paid I think it's an excellent value. If I had paid $89.99 I would have still been happy as that's the price the aforementioned 2 go for and I prefer this one. 

I know people typically hesitate to pull the trigger on NAS Scotch releases but I would say this one is worth a try if you enjoyed heavily sherried whisky. 

Cheers all!"
