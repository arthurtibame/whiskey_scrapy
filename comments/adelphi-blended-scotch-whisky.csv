4.0,"A weird, boutique-y blend that's suddenly showing up on local shelves, Adelphi's ""Private Stock"" blend actually has some qualities to recommend it--its sub-$30 price, for one. Actually this whisky reminds me a lot of that *other* boutique affordable blend with spotty distribution, Té Bheag. The nose here is heather honey, followed by light orchard fruits (apples), and a nice base of brine, iodine, seasalt, and earthy peat. Leather, maybe. Honeycomb, and some floral character as well, then a wisp of smoke. Some butterscotch and caramel. Taste is fruit initially (apples, pears)--though soft--and then you get that honey, that earth, brine, and the (light) smoke. Some pepper (signs pointing to some Talisker in this blend, somewhere). A light meaty fattiness, and some more smoked meat and ash on the finish along with apple skins. The body here is quite light, but it's not a super watery whisky--there's just enough creaminess to make things pleasant. Shockingly full and flavourful at this price point, with actual honest to god seaside/peat character, and all without a lot of that grain whisky ""pretzel dough"" character I get in many cheap blends. This seems like a well-kept secret of a blend: a real treat at a superb price."

3.5,"Smooth one. 

Descent but I was expecting more.

Still a good everyday whisky"
3.5,"Apple and butterscotch dominate, but well balanced by brine and earthy peat. Toffee and a slight pepper note. Very smooth and well balanced. Great for the price, the best low-price blend I've tried."
4.0,"A lot of honey and caramel tones, an accessible, yet very nice everyday goto whisky. Favourite blend so far! And the price!"
5.0,"Beautiful combination between few classical grains, Islay and Highland malts. Gentle smoke, rich taste and color.Almost perfect blended scotch for this price."

3.5,"This has to be the cheapest whisky I've had since my days living in Ireland and Tullimore Dew at $35USD. What can you say. It's Adelphi so you can't go wrong. Definitely not Glenborradale, old single malt or even new spirit good. It's got the familiar sherry, toffee, caramel, butterscotch flavour albeit accompanied by a slight harshness. Still best so far on my 'cheap night dram' tasting spree. $7USD a dram here at the Last Word bar. 3.5. rounding up to 4 for VFM."
4.0,Think I've found my go to blend @$30. Previous reviewer depicts it perfectly. Nothing more to say.
