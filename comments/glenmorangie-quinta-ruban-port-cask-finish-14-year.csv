5.0,"Nose is sweet and slightly flowery, cherry blossomish, the port maturation is immediately and unapologetically evident. Initial tastes are sweet and syrupy. Thick silky mouth feel. Candied oranges and dark chocolate. Maybe slightly nutty. Finish is very long and introduces hints of pepper and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg."

4.5,"I actually like the 12 year slightly more. This one is a bit thinner and not as dark, surprisingly. Still velvety, still rich, still oily, still fantastic, but not quite as much as the 12 year. A bit more spice and chocolate than it’s younger counterpart."

4.75,"This is one of my all time favorites.  The nose is incredible.  It is a little sweeter than some, but with just a hint of smoke to balance it out.  I do tend to lean toward bourbon barrel aged whisky, and this one delivers, with the extra four years in port casks giving it an added depth of character.  I was a fan of the 12 year expression and this is a slight improvement over an already excellent dram."
4.0,"Picked this up a couple of weeks ago and have spent some time with it. It has a beautiful and unique rose color - hopefully this is natural color. Lots of plum and grapes on the nose and palate augmenting that familiar base Glenmorangie honey malt. I notice that with water there is a bit of bitter bite on the end, but a couple drops of water remove it. With a bit of water added it is dangerously drinkable. Very good."

4.25,"Reddish color, viscous, clear, likely chill-filtered. Nose is moderate, with hints of rose, raisins, vanilla and a bit of tobacco. Palate is smooth and rich, sweet, with hints of chocolate, vanilla, oak, sherry, and a bit of lemon zest. Finish is medium-length, with a touch of bitterness and floral in character. A touch of water in this 46% ABV dram opens additional sweetness and fruitiness. Aftertaste gains more citrus notes and becomes longer. Water definitely makes this one more round and well-balanced. Overall, it’s a pleasant dram, reasonably rich yet not too difficult, with a definitive port influence. Part of a 3-bottle collection bought at Costco for $99. Definitely worth the money."

1.5,"Pours a bit of a pink color, or at least it's a pink hue within the traditional golden color here.  Legs are there..it's 46%, nothing special.  

On the nose i get toasted wood, a bit of jam, some light spiced bread.  There's nothing intense or interesting here at all.  A lot of muted spice and tannin from both likely bourbon barrels and perhaps some port.  

The flavor is a bit more interesting.  It had a nice body that they call velvety and I'll agree with them.  It has rich sweetness and I can get a touch of mint and orange as they note on the box.  There is a good amount of rather mellow and yet spiced oak in here, I don't recall this much oak from the 12 year.  I also don't recall this much mouth feel.  

Finish is medium, it doesn't last forever and it becomes a touch spicy and dry.  

A good 45 dollar bottle, but nothing special and all and all uneventful."

null,"So my screen name is from college, I studied biomedical science and Austin Powers had just come out; my reference was from the part where Dr. Evil was asking Scott about his future plans like running a petting zoo.. ""an Evil petting zoo?"" Dr. Evil exclaimed.  I added it to my email - and it never went away. Back to booze: I grabbed this bottle because everything i’v had from Glenmorangie has been pretty darn good - and ...this whiskey happens to follow suit- the mouth feel during the finish is exceptional - its velvety and delicious. My only complaint is the nose - it's a little jumbled, its fruity and funky - specifically; it has a dried apricot note which I never equate to quality - I have a bunch of ice wines and the bogus tasting note for lower end bottles is apricot - So Im' unequivocally bias; considering some people may enjoy that element. Anywhoooo... this is good stuff and definitely great VFM. Cheers"
2.75,Similar to sherry cask 12 yr. sweet. Less spicy. Gasoline after taste?

4.5,Very excellent. Didn’t have the time to do a good profile but truly exceptional
4.0,"Glenmorangie changed up the age statement on the Quinta Ruban from 12 years to 14 years.  so naturally I had to buy both and compare.  The 12 year old was finished for 2 years in port barrels.  So we all assume that the 14 year meant 4 years of finishing in port.  Well after comparing the two I think it still is only 2 years of finishing in port.  

The color is a hint lighter than the 12 year.  It seams to have lost a little bit of that redness that the 12 year had.  The smell is lighter and the taste is lighter as well.  As for the finish....well yep you guessed it.  Now the finish is probably the closest similarity to the 12 year old which is a good thing.  It really is only a hint lighter.  

So in conclusion the new 14 year old is still very good and still is full of flavors.  I will be buying it again but I will also be buying up all the remaining 12 year olds as well."

4.0,"Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 12 & 14 year versions

QR 12, 46% non chillfiltered
Nose: sweet dried fruit, sticky prunes, spice, honey 
Taste: sweet, fruity, honey, baking spice-turns dry, then more honey

Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 14, 46%, non chillfiltered
Nose: citrus, orange peel-spiciness, more orange, a Terri’s chocolate orange
Taste: rich, dark fruits, juicy, then turns dry, chocolate, bitter chocolate, mint, spices.  Wow!

With a little water and time you’ll get vanilla cake.  Like an orange vanilla cake with chocolate filling 🤤 -

Both versions are great.  On the nose the 12 is more fruity sweet, where the 14 is more orange citrus spicy-sweet.  Taste is similar, but the 14 goes more dark chocolate, spicy, more complex than the 12 year.  Good on Glenmorangie for adding on 2 years at the same price  and making a fantastic whisky. .

4.5,"Classic bourbon barrel undertones of a basic vanilla-heavy sweet oak. But as is typical glenmorangie, the finishing is in the foreground. The port sings here with a raisin-dominated sweetness that has impressive oakiness but throughout all layers is a wheat bread note from the malt.

4.0,"Nose: Apricot, iodine, cigar smoke and jolly rancher. The mouth feel is just a little oily, like a slightly melted Hershey kiss (though don't get me wrong,there's only the bare hint of dark chocolate in the taste). 
The taste is lovely, and distinct: Caramel, cherry, port, and a rapid snap of heat, both to the top of the mouth and the back of the throat. It is never too sweet; rather, it's rich and rewarding, and a rare mixture of sweet and heat. Imagine a very adult sourpatch kid, fermented in a barrel of perfectly dried apricot. Honestly, this is a first rate spirit, as long as you don't need that snap, that reminder that you're drinking whiskey...and that may be the only negative here (and this makes this comparable, say, with the somewhat similar Angel's Envy Port Finished Rye):  this may be too easy to drink, too much of a pleasure."

3.75,"Since I was a huge fan of the previous, 12 y.o. version of Quinta Ruban (and still am though it's pushing from hard to impossible to get a bottle), I was expecting a similar if not a greater approach on this Glenmorangie style of finishing whiskies in casks that previously contained different sorts of spirits, and in this case particularly, in ex-ruby casks, what constantly provides a distinctive tone both in aroma and taste. Although I would prefer to steer clear of the term ""disappointed"", I feel kinda fooled this time.

A bit plainer in overall, bit harsher, bit poorer in balance, somehow lacking this ""port"" flavor, which was really the point, yet still it is a remarkable (or close to that) whisky to consume, and at least I appreciate the distillery's versatility in a sense of trying to develop things that worked perfectly good in prior, even if it's not quite the successful case.

To the nose: sweet, full yet not really directed, a bit spirituous - caramel, tight and ropy sugar syrup, molasses, avocado with olive oil, warm chocolate covered cherries, mint, cocoa and coffee beans.

To the palate: not very pronounced nor smooth, sometimes bold, with sweet herbal tones (like clover), sugary cough syrup, pineapple, plums, definite citruses, buckwheat honey, honey with rose petals, cayenne pepper, peppermint bubblegum.

In the aftertaste: bitter wood, conifer, tree gum, tangerines, hot spices, sweet mustard, a bit of chocolate.

Is this whisky bad? Not at all. It is decent but it could have been much more than just that."
