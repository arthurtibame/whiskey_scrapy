3.0,"I was really suprised by this.  Great flavors over all with quite a bit if fruit.  Apple I think stands out.  I'm still learning the differences.  The one quirk is that the smokey taste seems a bit off.  Like a pork butt done in a crock pot with liquid smoke, it's still good but just not the same as if it was done in a smoker.  Just my two cents."

4.0,"Smoky, sweet apple/cherry taste, surprising if you aren't expecting it, sometimes bitter aftertaste, best on the rocks or in an old fashioned, as the bitterness is counteracted"

2.0,I tasted this one at the Copper Fox distillery in Sperryville VA along with their other offerings. The apple/cherry smoke was interesting but didn't play so well with the rye as I would hope.
4.0,Unique rye

3.0,"This is the house rye at Founding Farmers restaurants. It's sweeter than other ryes I've tried, but still has a good kick. Apple flavor is definitely the strongest ingredient, though it's more noticeable on the finish. I'm not a rye lover, but this is nice."

2.0,"Very strange,  almost astringent finish.  They are trying to stand out with this one,  but to me the apple flavors take over the rye characteristics.  Tough to drink for me,  not a favorite"

2.0,Smooth &  thin with a bit of spice. The aggressive smoke leaves an aftertaste of burnt plastic.

2.0,"I couldn't really pick up any spice from what I've sampled. Almost tastes artificial in an attempt to mask it's immaturity. Slightly on the oily side, and prominent apples on the palate. Not much of a kick.  I would rather use something like this for a fall cocktail."

3.0,"[9/6/17] It's fine, really. Nothing special, just fine. Teasingly sweet, light burn on the aftertaste and very subtle pepper from the rye. I could see this as a decent mixer or cheap sipper."

2.0,"Copper Fox prides itself on the use of apple chips  in their distillery. And that's exactly what you get with this unique rye - a mouthful of sweet apples.  There is plenty of vanilla in the invitation and deep smoke that stays with the finish. I was initially not a fan, but I have to admit that it has grown on me some. Mostly because it is so unique.  Try it as an old-fashioned. I respect Copper Fox going off the beaten path, but there is still work to be done here."

3.0,Great nose. Different flavor than I was expecting. Smoky sweet cinnamon dominates with a bitter wood finish. Definitely one to revisit.
4.0,"Lots of smoke on the nose, doesn’t come through in the first taste though. I don’t get as much of an alcohol hit as the review here states, but there is some. Malt hangs around quite a bit."
3.5,The peppery spice seems to be the dominant aspect. Peatey

3.75,"Smoky and spicy, but not too much! Maybe too rough to enjoy by itself, but mixes wonderfully."
2.75,smokey with rye spiciness. Water smooths out the edges of the burn and brings out an oakiness.

2.5,"Polished brass is the color in this rye whiskey , and thin watery legs dribble down the glass.

To me, the nose comes off young, with a curious funk. There are specific notes of sour fruit, moss, wet leaves, dry corn, sweet incense smoke, and wood cleaner.

The palate is overall sour with a thin mouthfeel with notes of burnt caramel, granola cereal, Froot Loops dust, and oaky tannins.

The thin finish is of medium length.

Cheers!"
4.0,Ton of bite and full of flavor. Not your typical whiskey.
