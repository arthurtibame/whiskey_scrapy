3.0,"This bottle gets A LOT of hate from the purist community, which is fine and somewhat understandable. However, sitting around a firepit, this stuff is good. Yes, it's ridiculously sweet, but still reasonably (I'd say mid-level) hotness on the back end. I mix this with about 25% water to really dull down the sweetness and bring out more of the fruity and tell tale Knob Creek flavor."

1.0,"The sweet syrupy maple flavoring completely obscures the flavor of the bourbon. I had to cut it with a non-flavored bourbon by 50% in order to finish the bottle. As all flavored bourbons seem to be, this is targeted at the youth market. Much sweeter than Hudson Maple Cask (which I also found to be too sweet.)"

4.0,"My favorite flavored bourbon. the maple tastes real (Im from New England, we get touchy about our syrup) and blend well with the bourbon without masking it.

1.5,"If Aunt Jemima made moonshine instead of maple syrup this is what you’d end up with. I’d elaborate but after having one of these my blood sugar spiked and I’m just now coming out of a diabetic coma lol.  This is artificial maple syrup pretending to be bourbon. If you’re a bourbon “purist” this is a hard pass, just put this bottle down and walk away. 

Glad I only had a shot..."

2.25,"Too sweet.  Nice aroma, but way too sweet to enjoy neat or even with a cube or 2."
2.75,Nose has strong maple syrup. Continued with overpowering sweetness that made it difficult to drink more than a few sips. Didn’t fare better cut with water or ice. Not a drink I’d order again. Interesting concept but poorly executed.
1.75,"Too much. I think it would be good for cooking: deglazing and making sauces for pork chops, or as bottom note for a bbq sauce. A little strong on the maple sweetness for drinking."
3.0,Maple flavor is a bit overwhelming. Easy drinking.

3.0,It’s very very strong with the maple it’s like dessert.
0.5,"It's the worst whisk(e)y I've had so far. I thought I would like it, being from Quebec; one of, if not the biggest producer of maple products, but it just doesn't feel/taste right. It's like ordering crepes or pancakes with breakfast and getting bad/cheap corn syrup with simulated flavour added to it instead of real maple syrup: disappointing.
I (normally) have only one bottle opened per brand at a time in my collection and this one is my ""shooter"" when I have friends over so I can be done with it and try another from Knob Creek."

Too overpowering, too sweet, too much nose.  There's no whiskey left.  I hate to say this, but I honestly found this revolting.  Maybe I'm just a purist, but I'd rather have whiskey with a side of bacon than whiskey that tastes like maple bacon instead of bourbon."

Taste and smell is overwhelmingly mapley, and if you get even a little bit of this Elixir of Death on your hands, you’ll be smelling it for hours. 

It’s really, really sweet, and the pungency of the added flavors overpowers any other flavors that might be there. 

I do appreciate the fact that this is bottled at 90 proof, but I feel that the effort is wasted. 

Save yourself some money and drink a bottle of Aunt Jemima instead."
