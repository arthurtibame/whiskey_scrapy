3.25,Green apple and rye spice. The bottle is getting better and better. I might have to get another one - after they start releasing 2-year ryes 😀
2.75,"Batch 1, Mecklenburg ABC, aged at least 8 mos in 15 or 30 gallon barrels with a #4 char. 

This bottle was a little harsh when I first opened it but, it’s been getting better and better. After a Five Guys Bacon Cheeseburger and fries I’m getting raisins and honey. I’m drinking it neat but I bet this would make a great Old Fashioned."
