4.5,"Representing speyside rothes river

Nose: sherry and caramel, molasses. Mix of heavy sweet with light salt. Hint of smoke. Beautiful nose without water. With water nose opens up to give green grape and roasted nuts. 

Body: full, 55.1% comes through with out water. Water calms this down. 

Palate: sweet caramel, sherry powers through with a lovely hint of smoke. Really tastes like it smells. Delicious. Water takes this beats and allows it to mellow out. It is absolutely delicious and unfolds in layers of almost chewy caramel and nuts. So good. 

Finish: looooooong and spicy hot without water. With water the length is punctuated by caramel, smoke and nuttiness

Note: water makes this a much more enjoyable dram. This feels like the perfect dram for sitting in a smoky room in big leather chairs shooting the breeze with the boys. Just a great dram"
