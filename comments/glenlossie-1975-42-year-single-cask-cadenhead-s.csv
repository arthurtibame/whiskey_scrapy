3.0,Quick Fact: Most of Glenlossies stuff goes into Diageo's blends these days. Anyway onto the whisky one of 138 bottles I believe. Nice to taste a slice of history and a new distillery (for me) but poor casking means it doesn't add up to much sadly. Standard bourban refill fare and definitely not worth the $400 or $500 it retails for now at auction.
