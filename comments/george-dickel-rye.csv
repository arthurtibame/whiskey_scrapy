4.0,"It's LDI's 95% rye recipe under yet another label. But LDI's 95% rye is good stuff--minty, menthol, pine, bubblegum, a hint of gin-y-ness--and so is this. Identical to Bulleit Rye, so if you like this flavour, buy whichever of the two is cheaper."

4.0,"Very mild in flavor when I compare it to other ryes I've had before. I still get the vanilla, spice, herbs and sweet but I feel as if the volume is muted. Similar to the way Glenlivet 12 tastes in comparison to its Macallan counterpart. Overall still a great rye suitable for drinking neat but won't be insulted by being mixed in a Manhattan or an old fashioned."

Doesn't linger as long as Bulleit but just tastes more like a real whiskey to me. I just bought this for 20 dollars ...20! Not on sale either. It feels like robbery being this good for that price.

3.0,Ok yes u all know I love me some rye. And I love the spicy and dry finish of this dram. There is just a hint of sweet and great anise hiding under the dry sand that is the base of this drink.  I love it.  But hold the phone. Wow is it hot!  I have tried ice water and blowing on it and the heat is up front in the middle and on the back side.  Now I am a manly man and I can take it but whoa nelly if the fire was tamed a tad bit this would be a 5 star.  As it is
4.0,"Unique nose of vanilla, spearmint, oak, clove and dried fruit. The palate is a great balance of mouthfeels with good weight yet delicate texture. Herbaceous notes flood the palate leading way to toasty character and smoke creeps in upon swallow. The finish is lengthy, especially for the price and resolves with soft, fruity notes of raisin and toasted almond."

3.0,"Have been wanting to give this one a try, but my local ABC doesn't carry it. Decided to pick up a bottle while travelling the other day. It has been a long time since I've had Bulleit (LDI/MGP's 95% Rye) so I can't compare GD Rye to it, but I can compare it to a more recent purchase, James E.Pepper (Also an LDI/MGP 95% Rye). They are very similar. Both have a Rye heavy nose with a heavy dose of dill and an almost shellac or varnish note. On the palate this one is missing the vanilla sweetness on entry that the JEP has. It's there, just not as pronounced. I don't know if that is a by product of the longer aging, the charcoal filtering, or the lower proof. The dill is there, as well as the peppery spice. A minty aftertaste lingers after a short, sharp finish. While I liked the JEP a little better, this one is around $10 cheaper and worked just as well in my Old Fashioned. Not my favorite rye, but still a solid choice."

4.0,"I first tried this whiskey last summer and really liked it.  I've been wanting to get some more to give it a proper tasting and I finally did.  It's even better than I remember.

In the glass it's a nice medium amber honey color.  It coats the glass well and produces nice thick, long legs.

First impression on the nose is spice, oak, and alcohol.  Letting it sit for a while brings out a grassy/floral tone with vanilla and maybe some lemon notes.  Even more time in the glass reveals hints of caramel.  The longer it stayed in the glass, the more sweetness came out in both the nose and the palate.

In the mouth this dram has a big, bright rye spice character that was immediately noticeable.  Like the nose, the palate benefits from time in the glass, with vanilla, cinnamon, and hints of caramel coming out after some time.  It has a fairly thick mouthfeel.  The finish is warm, fairly long, sweet and peppery.

This is a very drinkable rye whiskey that is enjoyable any way you like: on the rocks, neat, or in cocktails.  Add in it's $20 price tag and you have an excellent value as well.  Solid 4.0/80."

3.0,"A solid daily drinker rye. As many note, it is herbal and even grassy. I call it the camomile tea of whiskey. No strong flavors, but there's no lack of flavor. A gentle alcohol astrigency on the nose, gentle because it is tempered by aloe, after which I pick up a light layer of sweet raw almond and spice. The palate doesn't drag its feet---it gives you what its got in quick order, a lovely herbal bouquet. That compact taste profile gives it a reliable simplicity that's hard to dislike. Light radish and bay leaf with a sprinkle of pepper hovers above the soft spice finish, which infuses itself into a sugar cookie as it fades. You set your head back, and realize you're quite pleased."

Nose... Rye all day long. If you know rye whisky then you'll pick up the 95 percent rye immediately. Sweet and leathery, tobacco like. Definite fruit though and alcohol burn.

Taste... The Tennessee smooth sipping style is apparent immediately. It matches the spiciness that the rye offers and mellows it perfectly, bringing about such sundae type flavors. 

Overall it's just so solid for the price and quality. At 20.00 USD it's an absolute steal, a must have in your collection of rye whisky and brown liquor in general."

Finish: a little oakiness comes through beyond the notes in the taste but those do linger a while
After reading reviews: distiller references way more herbal notes than I got but I’ve had extreme herbal ryes like High West Double Rye and this isn’t like that, Flaviar noted cherry which was the dominant profile for me (along the lines of Old Forester Rye) as well as the mint that was featured prominently in Whizzky reviews.  Also some mentions of savory or smoky notes that align with the bacon I got on the nose.

4.25,"George Pickle rye smells just like a dill dickel! Wait, umm.. I mean... 

I do get a strong dill scent on the nose of this whiskey. There’s also a strong hint of freshly cut grass and some black pepper and other spices. 

I really hate pickles, and thankfully, this stuff tastes nothing like the little green devils. The flavor is fairly complex, and quite well-rounded for what it is. There’s no corn in the mashbill, but there’s still plenty of vanilla-y sweetness and tongue-coating creaminess. Quite lovely. 

This is the same MGP 95% rye mashbill as Angel’s Envy Rye and Bulleit Rye. I like this whiskey just as much as Bulleit, and it’s smoother to boot. It’s unfair to compare it to AE Rye, since AE is much older and rum-finished, but Dickel can hold its own ground. 

The value is superb, and the whiskey is enjoyable for both beginners and seasoned rye enthusiasts."

4.5,"Whoa, that's a weird one! Smells like dill and pickles, but tastes a bit nutty, a bit spicy and, oh, so creamy. A lot to decipher here!"
3.75,Still developing a taste for rye's but this was very spicy and tart i liked it.

3.75,"Grassy nose, smooth sweet vanilla palette, spicy and sweet finish"
2.75,"It tastes like dill pickles. Weird. 
Edit: I've give a better review, but this stuff is still weird. It's a very floral rye, not deep or rich. Foral almost like a Bulleit rye.The charcoal mellowing process is one that I'd imagine to bring a rich wood and char flavor but it just mellows it out and makes it almost like a syrup (if that makes sense). The George Dickel Bourbon expresses that mellowness even more. Now for my comment on the dill pickles. A few other people notice this too but we are all unique so maybe you won't notice it but for me, it smells exactly like dill pickle juice. And I soon as I noticed it, I can't get rid of it. It's not for me but that's the awesome thing about whiskey, its unique to the drinker. Some people love it and thats awesome! But it's too mellow, floral, and pickley for me. Give me some Knobb creek rye over this."
4.75,"I got my 750 ml bottle @ Walmart on closeout for $12.50, plus tax. This has a clear, amber appearance, standard fence board alcohol legs, and a sweet, savory, and minty spiced nose. The flavor is of spicy, sweet grain, charred oak, and even Aim toothpaste. Mouthfeel is medium, and George Dickel Rye finishes quick to moderate. RJT"
3.5,Solid rye. Great spiciness from the rye.

3.5,"Nose: mint, sweet (toffee? marshmallow?), eucalyptus, baking spices, dill, breathe deep to get isopropyl that turns to pine/resin

Taste: white peppercorn, dill, lemon peel, nutmeg, cardamom, vanilla,"
3.0,"When a buddy of mine who hates ryes told me that he was into this whiskey, I was surprised.  When I tasted the whiskey, I was even more surprised.  The Rye spice was barely noticeable, only coming out after the whiskey is long gone.  Dickel Rye does have an odd tongue numbing astringency with bigger drinks, so just stick to sips.  A rye whiskey for people who don't like rye whiskies."
4.0,"Spicy, with ground pepper, some kind of dried herb, and a dry oak at the end. Finish is medium-long, with that herbal note hanging on.... maybe rosemary with slight dill?"
4.5,Very solid for its price.

4.0,Nice Rye. Smooth beginning with a distinct Rye taste. Slight rasp finish. Caramel and vanilla undertones decent rye and the price was less than $30.
