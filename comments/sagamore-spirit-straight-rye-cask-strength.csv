3.75,"Tasted on 5/15/19 at Whiskey House, San Diego."
4.25,"Needs just a touch of water to soften and open it up. Wood and caramel on the nose. The wood continues through to the taste and is joined by vanilla, caramel, and rye spice. Pleasant long finish."

4.0,"Spicy, fruity, sweet, salty, flavorful. Apple, salted caramel, vanilla, cinnamon. Nicely balanced with rye spice, wood, caramel, toffee apples, saltiness. At 56.1 ABV there’s much more flavor and depth than the standard 41.5 ABV version. Decent finish. Nice dram."

4.0,"Delicious. My pour cocked in at 112 proof.

Viscous mouthfeel with a Cognac like finish. Dark fruit and pears persist throughout.  Really enjoyable and smooth.  Definitely dangerously delicious"

4.25,Phenomenal pallet. Added barely a few drops of water and it opened right up. A great fire-side supper for sure.

3.0,"Well done nice lite rye.  Would argue their straight rye is more approachable.  Only Bookers has really perfected Cask strength.   So sad Sagamore is all about Maryland, but liquid is from Indy.  Sure they disclose it it, but their story is Penn rye."
4.0,Tastes like Christmas fruit cake. No pepper.
2.75,"""Neat”

""0-1: Bad. What mixers can I use with it to cover it up
2: Meh. Simply not my taste, nothing to be excited about at all
2.5: Sub-par. Ill drink it... but only because its whiskey.
3: Good. Decent stuff, but not a rebuy
3.5: Very good. I might buy again
4: Excellent: Will be purchasing a bottle asap
4.5: Incredible: top of the purchase list
5:Amazing: cost and taste are worth every cent"""""
