Nose - Sweet and savory elements but the dominate note is from the port influence. I get a bit of a grape bubble gum with a red wine element. behind that is light oak, some vanilla, some jam, and just a general springbank slightly salty malty experience. 

Taste - My first though it just how long and complex this one is. There's at least 3-4 transitions, it goes from sweet to bitter to savory. It starts a bit waxy sweet, muted flavors, but sweet. Then some oak tannins come in and it takes on this slightly bitter note still with this sweet and muted malt profile. Then things get crazy as it turns to these salty springbank elements and the flavor just goes all over the place and creates a wonderful long and complex finish. The fruity grape bubble game notes are there though I'm starting to think more juicy fruit with a drop of a wine element, the malt is very oak touched but not overly so giving it a very nice balanced feel. 

The 2019 springbank is somewhat hit or miss for me so far. My first few pours were outstanding but I'm not sure if it is me but right now this isn't blowing my socks off. It's incredibly complex, the 46% is just enough to give this a nice mouth feel while allowing you to swirl this in your mouth and really take it in without any alcohol fatigue. Overall this is really nice stuff.

A must buy if you can afford and are an advanced whisky drinker (you need to like the whole spectrum from peat to wine finishing to oak and everything in between to get this one).
