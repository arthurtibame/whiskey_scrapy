3.0,"Neat.  Opened more than 6 months.  I remember not being too impressed with this pour on first impression.  

With time on the shelf, the nose ain’t bad.  Corn and old hay in a barn.  Watermelon starburst.  Vanilla.  It’s muddled but not off putting.

It’s light but not thin on the tongue.  Cinnamon sugar up front.  Transitions to bubble gum and that watermelon starburst note.  Not a fan of that bubble gum note when I hit it.  Seems to happen more often on young craft whiskey.

This isn’t meant to be consumed neat.  It a mixing bourbon sure."

3.5,"Neat.  Nose presents a bubble gum flavor right off the bat.  Hard to escape it.  Never encountered this flavor before.  Some vanilla hides behind that.  Not getting much else on the nose.

Texture is light bodied.  Taste is approachable and simplistic, sweet forward.  Bright notes, vanilla upfront.  Bubble gum flavors remains on the legs.  Hint of all spice on further tastes.  For a “high rye” the spice is downplayed considerably.

This sits in an odd space for me.  I could drink this all day and be happy about it... but not excited about it.  Its approachable, no off putting aspects, but no exceeding qualities. Interesting enough to keep an eye on this Distiller."
