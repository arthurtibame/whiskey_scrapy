4.25,"Instead of being beat over the head with peat and the smoke, you get a nice blend of saltiness and brine; more like sitting at the seaside than in a peat farm. The peat is certainly there, but it’s a bit more reserved, refined, and balanced with the oceanic tendencies. 

I’d say the predominant flavor is rich, smoked oysters, but there is also a bit of dried pear-like sweetness, and some pepper on the finish. 

Would definitely drink again. Quite a bit more complex, smooth, and flavorful than I had anticipated, particularly given the price point."

Drank neat, the pepper notes dominate and it's quite hard to find the citrus which I get on the nose. The finish is pure pepper and peat. This is one of the few whiskys I recommend to drink with an ice cube- it mellows the pepper down to a comfortable level."

4.25,No expert but I can't believe there is better than this for a 10 yo Scotch. My bottle sat for a bit (couple years). Smokey and fruits on the nose. Salt and peat with a slight numbing effect after a few sip. Mildly sweet. One of my favorites

4.5,"Talisker 10

NOSE: Sweet Smoke. Caramelized Burnt BBQ Sauce or that Caramelized Candied Bacon that has become all the rage. Briny. Dried Seagrass. Leather. Pepper Spice. Fresh Churned Butter. Hint of Light Citrus. Dive in too deep and get admonished with a little alcohol sting. The longer it's in the glass the more the Maritime Notes take over. 
NEAT: Smoke. Honey. Dried Tropical Fruits like Pineapple, Mango, and Papaya. Vanilla Custard. The finish is amazing. Long and Tingly. Effervescent. It's a quick burst of Heat that tingles and fades, like you've taken a drink of super carbonated water. Ash, Light Citrus, and a Jalapeño tingle coat the palate. 
SPLASH: A little water and the nose is more Fruit Forward. The effervescent quality is dampened slightly. The finish is still great with a little less Jalapeño and a little more Fruit Sweetness. 

VERDICT: There is just something here that is hard to describe. Under the smoke is a crave-able sweetness that I get from no other whisky. It's hard to describe, but you just want to return to it over and over. The finish bumps this solidly into ""favorite whisky"" consideration. A rising tingle that just goes on and on. Plus, hours later and I'm still enjoying the sweet smoky grilled charred fruit aftertaste. This one comes in on the extreme high side of my budget at $72, but I will definitely keep a bottle of this on hand from now on."

Dalmore Glencairn Copita Nosing Glass

NOSE:
Neat - Campfire on the beach, some peat, and iodine, cigar box, and leather. Secondary notes of orange peel, and clove. Very alluring. 

PALATE:
Neat - Wonderfully composed. The initial sweetness quickly gives way to a smoky brine and a pop of pepper, The finish is candied orange and ginger with a hint of Jalapeno pepper. Very long finish. A marvelous dram. 

CONCLUSION:
Good gawd. This is boner Scotch. I want to bath my wife in it and go to town.

4.0,"Aromas of BBQ pulled smoked pork and Bacon, with also a mildly sweet fruity note in the background. Salty at the taste, almost as when sea water evaporates and you lick the remaining salt from your lips. Then the smoke develops and stays in the aftertaste, and I can almost feel canned fruits in the background. Reminds me of Johnnie Walker Black, but this one’s definitely more complex. Probably good with black chocolate and underseasoned beef."
3.75,Solid taste. Not overly briney. Not overly complicated. But still a good flavor.

3.0,"As a whiskey beginner, this one is bizarre. A majorly distinctive nose, oozing with the smell of the sea, salt, and earth. With the high % and this nose, I thought it would be a tough sip, but it's really not. Extremely smokey and earthy. One of my first ever scotch tastings and it's an interesting one. It tastes like a bonfire that is close to fully being extinguished. Most interesting whiskey I've ever had, but nowhere near my favorite."

Sea spray, peat and burnt rubber on the nose.
Awesome mouthfeel with a good amount of peat, medicinal notes, charred wood and some sweetness I can't really place my finger on. Finish is long and really wraps up this awesome scotch. 

This is an excellent single malt for any whiskey drinker or anyone who enjoys a well aged spirit for that matter. I would love to have this handy in my home bar however for the price I don't think I will ever get a bottle of this when I could get a bottle of Ardbeg Ugi, Ardbeg 10 is considerably cheaper than a bottle of this aswell. Laphroaig Triple Wood goes for a few dollars less, all of these I have previously mentioned I will always buy over Talisker 10 at 80 dollars or more which is what this goes for where I live."

Then the palate is so smooth I can’t believe it’s only 10 years old. I mean, it barely stopped shitting its pants. Now this?
The finish bites a little more. Like a grumpy old man that you really love to hear rip on his neighbors. As long as he doesn’t turn that sharp tongue on you. 
I lived an entire beautiful life while sipping this incredible island single malt."

3.75,"Nose: Smokey and not lacking in peat! Some apple. Briney seaweed and sea salt. 

Palate: Kind of oily. Saltiness is subtle and blends well with the peat smoke. Apple and pear mixing with some citrus for a delightfully sweet taste. Firm feel.

Finish: Long. Citrus stronger than apple here. Some sweetness. Sea salt a little bit stronger. Feels like taking deep breaths of seaside air feel. 

Overall Thoughts: It feels as if I’m drinking this right near the shore. Very pleasant and comfortable and doesn’t go overboard (sea joke...) with the flavor and burn itself out. The smoke and the peat aren’t overpowering like some other whiskies in the region. Very nice dram."
