2.5,"I really enjoyed the 10 year old...lets see if my memory was right and if this at 140 bucks is justified.

OK - so this alabama style stuff would mean they are flavoring it with apples. So lets see

Nose - very alcohol forward, the 120 proof under sells this. I'm getting butter scotch, vanilla, and yeah that might be an orchard fruit. A lot of alcohol notes on a toasted oak note as well. My first thought it perhaps a bit sweeter than some but more or less classic light whisky notes. Maybe there's some apple notes here but it's not much. 

Taste - my first and really instant thought was ""MGP light whisky"". That's really all I'm thinking. Vanilla, custard, butter scotch, and a very sweet fruity upfront note. But really, blind I'm just assuming 11-13 year old MGP light whisky and I'd generally say this is a bit more on the buttery, sweet, viscous side vs some that are a bit thinner and more spirit forward. 

Overall I really am into this one. But I like light whisky. That said 140 bucks was WAY too much for this and it doesn't remind me of the 10 year which I really enjoyed.

I'd pass on this one. 2.5 stars.  It'll be on my shelves for years to come, but I'm not THAT upset with having it around."
