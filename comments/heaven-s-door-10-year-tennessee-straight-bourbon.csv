There’s a good vanilla flavor on the tongue, and the finish is long with a little bite from the alcohol. It’s much more expensive than the varieties in the core Heaven’s Door range, but it is better."

It’s a very good bourbon, very smooth and drinkable, but for the price there are better options for a 10 year old bourbon. The packaging and presentation are very nice which is one reason my son got it for me - many thanks for a thoughtful gift!"

2.25,"Not at all what I expected. Smelled of acidic formaldahyde with tones of wood. We even had to rinse out the glasses in order to get a drop or two of water residuals to get the aromas to come through. Even in my ""Bourbon Junkies"" Glencairn glass. I wouldn't buy it. Unless maybe it was the only thing in a gas station hundreds of miles from civilization."
