3.5,"With 46% ABV, no chill-filtration and natural color, BenRiach 10 Curiositas is a craft presentation of a peated Speysider. On the nose, you get hay, fresh herbs and a punch of peat smoke with bitter honey and faint saltiness. The arrival is strong and mouth warming, turning more aromatic and distantly sweet in the development. However, it also tastes a bit young and rough. Dry peat smoke with a touch of oak cask bitterness characterizes the rather weak finish. To conclude, it's a decent 'peated alternative' but without the caliber of an Islay Single Malt.

3.0,Tried this along with Glendronach Peated and others. One of my least favorite peated whiskys. Ok but thin and not a lot going on complexity wise. Doesn't hold a candle to the islay greats
4.0,"Ah, the fruitier side of peat. Based on another review (Horst from whisky.com) I believe this is natural color and non chill filtered, however neither is stated on the bottle or tube. I hope this is not an indication that Benriach has changed both aspects of production. 46% ABV and at a pretty good price for an uncommon single malt at about $60. 
The peat on this Speyside scotch is different from the Islay offerings. Lighter and fruitier but with plenty of peat smoke to go around, think Highland Park 12 on steroids. Not as complex as the HP12 but comparable taste and much more peat. Fresh red fruits, a bit of citrus, pineapple, oak, floral notes and a hint of mint. 
The palate is peppery and smoky but not over the top. The oak also comes through quite nicely. Very different from the nose. 
The finish is dry, short and abrupt with a slight lingering pepper/smoke. 
A better finish would have improved the rating, but this is a quality single malt and a good option to go with if you are just venturing into peated malts and are not ready to tackle Islays south coast distilleries."

3.5,"I received this as an early birthday present from my cousin, whose wife  purchased the bottle from a local shop, with as only instruction: make sure it's a peated one! While I have had some very nice not-Islay drams (Talisker, Ledaig, to name a few), I wouldn't really think in the direction of the Speyside.
  This 'Curiositas' has matured 10 years, and made fora nice first acquantance with Benriach. Bottled at 46% ABV, the nose was rather sweet & modestly smoky. Beware - not exactly an Islay smoke, but somewhat sweeter. In the palate, there's obviously sweet  peat (and smoke), but also some roasted fruits (ans some vanilla?), without  getting too sweet, and I also found some mild pepper and oak.
  My favorite Speyside dram to this point!
(3 stars, but I would give 3.5 stars if Distiller would allow this)"

4.0,"It’s raining outside, a gentle shower after a midsummer thunderstorm. The trees are dripping, and thunder and lightning fade into the distance. The aroma boasts vegetal peat. It is neither oily nor meaty, neither salty nor smoky — it just smells like mossy, boggy peat, and wonderfully so. Curiositas is buttery and creamy actually, both on the palate and in the mouthfeel. I taste marzipan, fresh cracked cardamom pods, and lemon peel. With the rounded and rather malty foundation, though, there are nuances, among them the sensation of floral jasmine after a rain shower. The juniper-like and peppery finish is somehow cooling. It’s not an easygoing dram per se, but it’s certainly one that I’d introduce to peat newcomers, and is overall a stellar quotidian malt. The creamy mouthfeel is elevated and the dram becomes sweetened when accompanied by an Hoyo de Monterrey de José Gener cigarillo, as it was tonight on the front porch."

3.0,"Second sample from Flaviar is BenRiach Curositas 10 yr. This is a peated Speysider, bottled at a respectable 46% ABV. It's a nice light gold and produces average legs while leaving a decent oily coating on the glass.

For a 10 yr whisky at 92 proof, it's remarkably tame in the nose, with almost no trace of alcohol burn. The nose has orchard fruits, berries, floral notes and some barely there smoke. It's lacking the sweet richness of a typical Speysider, but also the smoke of an Islay. What is this stuff? Hmm, maybe that's why they called it Curiositas?

The palate is much bolder than the nose, similar to the Caol Ila earlier. It's dry with apples, pears, and some nice smoke. There is a peppery oak flavor as well, and it has a thick mouthfeel. Not bad at all.

The finish is unremarkable - just a light campfire smoke, although it does linger a while. At $72 online, I just can't see myself buying a bottle of this. Not bad, but not for me. 3.5/5. Cheers!"

4.0,"Curious indeed.  Apples and bacon are a time-honored combination, and this offers that and more.

On the nose, it’s not much.  Some inky smoke and Speyside fruitiness, tea and butter.  Nothing special.  But the palate really raises the eyebrows.  Lovely texture.  A slimy fruitiness, like nectarines and papayas, immediately and completely overwhelmed by a savory and ashy peatiness.  But the seaspray salt/iodine is lacking, which is interesting.  Curious indeed.  The finish is dry and ashy, lacking the maritime soul of Islay.

I recommend this bottle.  Benriach is one of the distilleries that are getting better.  This dram is a proper Speyside interpretation of a peat monster.

PRESUMPTIVE MARK: 87/100."

3.0,"Not your typical peated Scotch but still a great one. The peatsmoke flavour is completely different compared to the classic Islay peat. Less medicinal, more earthy and grassy. Not overly complex and a fairly short finish. I enjoyed every dram from this bottle though. Honey/sea salt/peat"

After a while i found flavors of sherry, leather and more aromatic peat, very nice - this dram needs its time in the glass to calm down. On the palate not so heavily like Laphroaig 10, but interesting, and with growing intense. This is the fruity side of aromatic peat with a long dry end. Moves up on my list. Oh, and the price is also nice.

Smoked and grilled juicy red pears and apples transition into kebabs with sweet onions, summer squash, and zucchini, all perfectly caramelized.  The finish is rich and of medium length.  It puts me in mind of a smokey, sweet, and slightly tangy barbecue sauce.  This stuff is delicious and if not for my distaste for the smell, would be a 5 star rating."
4.5,Smoke on the nose but not offensive. The taste I received mint!
3.5,"Benriach tasting evening, Sydney, June 24 2019. Whisky #(supplemental)

Nose: Delicate peat, orchard fruit (apple, pear), light tropical fruit and berries. There are background notes of honey, oak and a touch of mint. As it rests, the smoky note becomes more defined and a little creosote, asphalt and soot are apparent, however it remains a light and delicate nose.

Palate: The arrival is smoky and a little peppery, but it's not overly intense and there is a balancing nutty sweetness. The development brings sweeter malt notes with dried fruits and spicy oak in support. There is an estery quality to the palate.

Finish: Short. Sweet and fruity with a touch of smokiness.

Curiositas was one of the first core releases from BenRiach when Billy Walker bought the distillery in 2004 and restarted it after two years of silence. The early releases were necessarily produced from old stock using peated malt from the distillery's own maltings. However, recent bottlings of Curiositas comprise 100% ""post-Walker"" distillery new-make using peated malt from Simpsons, and there is a distinct difference in profile.

I was not particularly fond of Curiositas the last time I tasted it (which was in 2010) as it seemed pretty hot and rough on the whole but I thought this 2018 bottling was much improved. Sweeter, fresher, more rounded and with a smoke note that is more delicate and complex. It's a pleasant whisky and a valid alternative to an Islay smoky, but to be honest I don't know that I'd bother to buy a bottle.

This was not a part of the formal tasting, however after the event had finished the brand ambassador uncorked a bottle and poured drams for those who had remained for an informal chat.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

3.25,"Representing speyside lossie river

Nose: mellow, sweet peat, hints of caramel, sherry, dried apricot, moss, hint of oak, vanilla cream, great nose

Body: smooth, pleasant, sweet, MJ notes honeyed (?)

Palate: the start at first go round was weird, like a metallic burnt nut. Prickly on the tongue. MJ notes big peat, smoke with fruit, but I taste burnt peat with sweet. 

Finish: just keeps going with late spice and warm and lingering, nice finish. 

Note: long, smoky finish. Kind of like a tamed down islay of sorts. Billed as a 19th century classic speyside malt. Definitely distinctive. Sweet, smoky but without vanilla and caramel which the nose suggests should be there.  MJ notes a nose of charcoal, soot (I see that), but I think I taste it too. In total I appreciate the sweet and smoke and burnt buts it’s one I’d share if talking about historically peated speysides and comparing peat/smoky from sweet drams. Good not great. Would be more my style without the burnt and with more vanilla. 

A second taste I mixed with glenglassaugh revival and it was just weird. It didn’t reduce the weird revival nose but it did cut down on the curiosity metallic start. Either way that mix isn’t the answer for glenglassaugh. I think I like the curiosity’s more though head to head. 

Third tasting I put in roughly ten drops of water and it changed the whiskey for the better. It opened up with much more vanilla and bourbon character which I like. Sweet peat still is the overall character and that weird metallic taste is still there but tamed with water. Like the box says it’s best tasted with a splash of water and they’re not lying."

4.25,"Awesome juice. Went into a dirty liquor store on the poor side of town and saw this thing all extra dusty with a price on it that was from before the single malt hike. Ka-ching, 20 bucks saved, an old 'to-drink' crossed off.


Some mentions: Bourbon, toasted virgin oak, and rum make the caskings up. You would swear there was sherry, but it says there isnt and you'll read why. Its NCF and without added coloring. My bottle literally had a few wisps of barrel wood in it before I opened it that I noticed when holding it to the light to reveal in its amazingly golden-yet-clear color.


NOSE
Inviting hit of smoke. Sweet smoke. Cherry trees that havent hit yet. TOBACCO. Concord grapes that are old and nearly turned. Peat is there, but not as much as Stephanie's expert review on distiller claims.

PALATE
Ever take the long long way somewhere? Iodine, but not the coastal/seaweed kind its earthy and dense and different (this is a speyside and those are rarely peated). Greasy, rich meat is immediately cut by fruit spice, clove (really, CLOVE, not baking spice), the bourbon cask's vanilla finishes you away from the licorice/floral complexity. Delicate floral keeps finding it's way through but NEVER gets in the way of what is going on--yum!

MOUTH
Long. Makes you swear there was a sherry cask. Layered. The heathery honey lingers in a way I did not expect but was delighted by. I wouldnt outright call it 'dry' like Steph but it is indeed deceptively easy--you would never know its 92 proof. 'Smooth' doesnt do it justice. 

 It's a rollercoaster compared to other things I've had with similar trappings but it saunters through them so slowly your tasting ""brain"" kinda stumbles as you get stuck finding your way through them. The bottle says add water and I tried ice--recommend you skip. It makes the sweet things come out bright, shiny and delicious but it muted all the amazing composition th is one has and vanished the unique peat it has.

Paid $45+tax but would've been happy with a lot more spent. It's good liquor."
3.0,"The peat/smoke flavour is just a bit intense for me. It's not a relaxing drink at all. 

Initially the flavour is as described bring Smokey, the middle is a little bit salty and the rear brings up a little sweetness and some caramel. 

It's a little complex and I didn't even notice that until I read some other reviews. I had just added a Smokey label to the entire experience which isn't fair as there is a lot more going on.

I'll try another BenRiach but with less peat to see how these whiskies behave themselves usually."

Smokey nose, rubber boots, saline and seaweed, umame. 

This tastes like a tidal pool with a sugar rinse. Oaky, peaty, iodine.

But the sweet doesn't meld. Reminds me of JW Green label. Curiositas maybe better integrated, but its not quite as complex.   They are comparable, however.  The Green leaning more to its Islay roots, the Curiositas leaning towards the Speyside.

I'm going to pass on buying this for $65, but I'll have it at a bar anytime.   With the prices of scotch whisky being impacted by politics and tarriffs its hard to judge value, but I'm feeling like I can do better for the same money."

4.75,"This is the final dram of this now empty bottle. It is my favorite whisky so far. I wanted to give it a whole bottle that I opened in early November to come back to every so often to see how it’s ranking compares to other whiskies of all varieties. And I can say my first impression still stands and it was, is and remains my favorite so far. For me it is near perfect. 

It is young, unique, wild, vibrant, complex, flavorful, has a lot of variety and every stage is so enjoyable from A to Z. 

This 10 years old whisky is triple cask matured in virgin oak, bourbon and rum casks. This sounds as wild as this whisky is. 

Nose: the peat, despite what others say, for me not intense or harsh - it is fresh and floaty and just builds nice brackets around this otherwise speysidy aspects. What’s makes this interesting is that the peat they used is from the highlands region which creates a in my eyes beautiful fusion. It is not the kind of peat that you associate with bacon or smoked foods. It is just a base solid peat not to overwhelming or aggressive. On the nose you also get vanilla, lemon peel, malt sugars, walnut, orchard fruits and cocoa. And while this somehow sounds the same as a lot of other whiskies (especially Speyside) the triple casks are blended so well together with that very well leveled peat, that it makes this different and unique to everything else I have tasted so far. It has Highland Park 18 qualities (meaning the peat part to it) but the BenRiach Speyside base gives it the fruity smoothness. It works just so perfectly together.

Palate: very sweet and malty at first and completed by a slight burn that doesn’t really feel like 46% ABV. It is definitely not oily and more in the rocky and fresh side. You also get fresh warm toasted wheat bread (French baguette) and a very friendly peat that lays some enjoyable wood and smoke on the tongue - wild and fresh and not meaty or aged at all. There also is lots of fruits now with mango and pineapple and milky caramel / toffee.

Finish: long and surprisingly not to dry. Leaves a wooden and sweet malty summer hay taste in you mouth for quiet some time. The finish is the only reason I don’t give it a full 5 rating. If the palate would offer some oilyness to transition into the finish with some of that smooth fruitiness it would be a 100/100 for me. I guess that would be achieved with a couple more years in the barrels, but that might make it miss the vibrance and freshness that it has now. But for this reason it is a 98/100 for me. 

It may sound weird but the whisky in combination of nose and palate is like a Bob Ross painting for me. It has a lot of details that are just a combination of several simple aspects - but in the end when it is all combined it falls in place so well, that it looks like it has been created with much more time and effort. It hasn’t but the product in the end looks so perfect and well rounded that it doesn’t matter how long it took to create and with what simple techniques - in a finished combination it just feels perfect and right. So right that you want to look at it again and again wondering how it was done. This will be a stable in my whisky collection."
4.0,"10 years is a peak age for many peated whiskies.  It's no coincidence that Laphroaig and Ardbeg age their introductory expressions for a decade, and that Bruichladdich's Port Charlotte line features a 10-year-old version.  Peat in the single digits often manifests as overly harsh and ash-y, or medicinal and weird as hell (sometimes even producing hot garbage notes, which I truly but bizarrely enjoy).  Highland peat and Islay peat are a little different, as expressions like the Balvenie Peat Week prove, but this bottle demonstrates that the decade mark is still a near-perfect time to bottle a peated whisky.  Its signature is balance: smoky, earthy tones countered by beer-like malt and apple sweetness.  It is not incredibly complex, but it is a simple, lovely pleasure of a whisky.  It's an easy drinker and a great candidate for a daily nightcap whisky (alongside drams like Talisker 10, or Gledronach 12 for sweet-tooths).  It's also reasonably priced in the $50-60 range, which makes it a realistic contender for that session dram role."
