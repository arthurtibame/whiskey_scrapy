5.0,"Very sweet, almost confectionary. Spicy but you can’t tell it’s 120+ proof, it tastes almost like 100. Very delicious and great drinkability. I had mine neat because I like a higher ABV but a friend had it on the rocks and it’s GREAT. I’d almost say it’s what you imagine in a perfect bourbon. “The way bourbon is suppose to taste”."
