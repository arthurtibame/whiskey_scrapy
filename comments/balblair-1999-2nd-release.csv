5.0,"In an evening full of good whisky, this was a standout. At 15 years old (13 in 2nd fill ex-bourbon and 2 years in 1st fill Oloroso sherry), this is a solid, and flavor-packed, middle aged dram. The nose oozes brown sugar; I can practically hear Mick Jagger singing ""yeah, yeah, yeah, WOOO!"" in the background...how come ya taste so good, Balblair? Along with the dark brown sugar is dried fig, floor wax, orange zest, and roasted pine nut/pignoli. It's a great nose...as is the palate, which is a rich, giving carnival (in the pre-Lenten sense of the word) of brown sugar, fig jam, light vanilla, candied orange rind, and a hint of chocolate and wildflower honey. So. Good."

4.0,"The tour group has supplied me with a tremendous amount of samples.  This sample provide by @Telex was long overdue by me, but better late than never. 

The nose is quite full. A rich honey nose and Irish Tea are immediate and foremost.  Ripened apples, dried apricots, vanilla, heather, malt and milk chocolate (like Whoppers candy).  Whew!  Then comes the orange wedges. Add a pinch of baking spices: cinnamon, nutmeg. A faint amount of the sherry notes comes through after a good deal of time.  The is worthy of your time. 

A soft, thick palate, and, like the nose, is honey rich. As the honey sweetness starts to fade, cinnamon spices and black pepper crescendo.  The spiciness softens back to sweetness: vanilla, caramel, more ripe apples, and milk chocolate.

The finish of oranges, pepper, oak, vanilla and more honey complete the whisky journey.  Somewhat short and wish it could be longer. 

A honey bomb from nose to finish.  The spice is a nice counter that does not take away or diverts the whisky from the main course.  Its like taking the service road on the highway to bypass traffic only to get back on the main road at the next on ramp.  If there is on weakness or criticism, it would be that the finish does not hold up to the nose and palate depths.  Overall, a very good whisky that you can pull out any time and flat out enjoy. Worth the wait, but don’t wait too long. [90/100][Tasted: 3/3/18]

3.25,"It won't be long until we'll all be longing for the days before the marketing department ruined Balblair.  These vintage statements as a brand staple were truly awesome and really set Balblair apart, sadly we'll now be getting boring age statements and the premium value in the brand will fade a touch.  

Nose - light honey, vanilla, pepper, baking spice, and light citrus.  

Taste - Plenty of vanilla, butter, spicy (european oak is shinning on this area), and apples.  Just a really nice complex whisky but I get a nice oily and buttery note that kinda brings it all together instead of leaving the flavors dancing around.  

This was my first Balblair and it has had me seeking out more expressions.  Sadly I've only been able to source younger ones without the sherry casks.  I really like this one and I'm deeply saddens to see the brand leaving their roots in the pursuit to raise prices through marketing tactics."
4.75,"Delightful, sweet, yet strong finish. An extremely unique taste with an almost dessert like aftertaste of vanilla and honey. Highly recommend."

4.25,"Starts out a bit shy, with classic soft green apple and brown sugar on the nose with stewed fruits and vanilla on the palate. 
After a while, the palate gets spiky-er and more complex, with brighter berries coming through.

4.25,"I've had quite a few Balblairs and found they were all solid if unspectacular. This dram is definitely a step above those though. Perfect balance, beautiful vanilla and as @Scott_E noted tea notes (thanks Scott I'm generally crap at putting a name to any unique flavours I taste). Mild spice and apricots, creme brulee, sultanas, gingerbread. Numm, numm. It's impressive as this isn't a style that usually makes an impact. Maybe its because of poor effort in the form of comparison the Glencadam 25 I had before it but I agree with Scott E on rating as well.  4 at least out of the gate. No make it a 4.25...it gets better and better as the dram progresses. Finally an excellent Balblair!"
4.5,"woody, sweet, full"
4.0,"Great, but not sexy."
4.25,"Un nez complexe, puissant, chargé en fruits cuits, comme de la banane ou de la prune. Très rond dans l'ensemble.
En bouche, l'attaque est sèche et un peu saline puis se révèle d'une belle rondeur sur du ""caramel de fruit"" soutenu par une pointe de sel. Bel équilibre.
La finale est puissante, agréable, chaleureuse mais manque d'un peu de gras sur la longueur, il me reste quelque chose de trop sec en bouche.
(Pas dégusté dans les meilleures conditions, à ré-essayer à l’occasion)."
4.5,"info: Mais, quelle belle boite! S'ouvre comme une porte avec des aimants, des images et du textes à l'intérieur... fin de la parenthèse esthétique. Je ne peux pas dire que j'ai particulièrement aimé les dernières éditions de Balblair et j'ai laissé longtemps de côté cette distillerie ayant eu une mauvaise impression (abstraction faite du 1990). J'ai finalement succombé aux commentaires positifs sur cette bouteille et à une offre spéciale sur cette bouteille en particulier (quand les astres sont alignées!). Ce scotch est une combinaison d'ex fut de bourbon américain et d'ex sherry butt d’Espagne de 1999. Il y a, à ma connaissance jusqu'ici, 4 release de cette bouteille dont la première était un ""traveler exclusive"" (disponible seulement dans les duty free). La première avait plus d'influence de sherry que les éditions suivantes. Mes tasting notes concernent la 2e édition du Balblair 1999 embouteillé en 2016. Sans filtrage à froid, sans couleur ajouté. Deux distinctions à sont actifs: l'or en 2015 ""Highlands & Islands 13-18 yo - The scoth Whisky Masters (The Spirits Business) et l'argent en 2017 ""international Wine & Spirit Competition"".

Nez: Herbes fraîches et pommes vertes (influencé par la couleur verte?), c'est fruité en tout cas! Non, je confirme les pommes vertes! Frais et sucré! Un verger, des fleurs de pommes. Des raisins?

Bouche: Pommes et raisins oui! Belles notes de sherry! Belle texture huileuse. Vanille.

Final: jus de pommes sucrés. chocolat noir et miel et orange.

Overall: Ok! c'est doux doux doux! Ceux qui aimes se faire arracher la bouche par un gros cask strenght tourbé vont être déçu. Pour les amateurs d'équilibre de fruité, c'est un beau bijoux! Je suis en accord avec les autres commentaires positifs sur cette bouteille. Les notes de Sherry ajoute une complexité supplémentaire qui échappe à d'autres éditions de Balblair. Loin d'un sherry bomb mais très bel équilibre! 88%"

4.0,"Stop number 63, and the last official stop for round 4 of the SDT is Balblair. This Highland distillery does not use age statements, but rather vintages. I suppose that way they can sample their casks and determine when they are ready for vatting and not be restricted to set age statement releases. This is the 2nd release of the 1999 vintage, which was bottled in 2014 making it roughly 15 years old. Bottled at 46% ABV, non chill filtered and natural color of yellow gold. 

The nose starts off with lots of honey. It quickly transitions into apples, pears, tangerines, oranges and apricots. Almonds, ginger and cinnamon. Light chocolate and vanilla. It’s fairly malty with a nice pepper note, and really comes across as an unpeated Talisker. Grape skins and a very light sherry note, buried way down deep. Faint oak and some caramel. The nose, overall, is light. I really wish there was more complexity to it. 

The palate is very malty with barley sugar and honey. Light sherry sweetness and a little pepper, again mimicking Talisker but without the peat smoke or intense pepper. Tangerines, apricots and oranges. Some brown sugar and caramel. Raisins, mild oak and almonds finish things off. 

A medium light bodied mouthfeel that starts a little mouthwatering but turns dry. 
The finish is medium length, dry with tangerines and slightly bitter almonds. 

After seeing rave reviews from @Telex, @LeeEvolved and @PBMichiganWolverine, I had high hopes for this one, but it seems to fall a little short for me. While I certainly appreciate the likeness to Talisker, I don’t want an unpeated Talisker knockoff. The complexity just wasn’t there for a 15 year old. This is very much like an improved Glenmorangie 10. At more than double the price though, it’s really not worth buying a full bottle. Round 4 was fun, but this Balblair was far from the top of the sample pile, but it was also not at the bottom. Thanks to Telex for the sample, 3.75. 
Cheers 🥃"

4.0,"I’m beginning to wind down the samples that were sent to me as part of our fourth round of the Distillery Tour group.  This Highland malt from Balblair is the second edition of the 1999 vintage.  I believe this is considered a 15 year old single malt, I’m just not sure why it’s not openly declared on the labeling.

This malt comes in with a slightly elevated ABV of 46%.  I’m also not sure whether it’s NCF’d or has additional coloring added.  It’s a beautiful gold color and gives you some silky, skinny legs in the Glencairn.

The nose opens with faint oak and it isn’t until you really give it 25-30 minutes that you are rewarded with some sweet honey and sherry notes.  There’s a bit of spice cake in there if you really invest the extra time and energy required to extract it.

The palate is seriously complex with a sensational, full mouthfeel.  It starts with vanilla and apples and transverses between sweet and light spices frequently during the entire sip.  It’s mesmerizing.  The finish is medium to long, constantly warming yet incredibly smooth.

Overall, this is a Highland malt I could seriously get behind and purchase over and over and be completely happy with it from one bottle to the next.  It won’t WOW you with surprises, but you could reach for this one during every session and just be thoroughly content every time.  Thanks to my new buddy, @Telex for this sample.  Excellent choice!  4.25 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,"Dear Mr. Glenmorangie, with much regret I must inform you that your services as our Highland single malt  of choice will no longer be needed.  We have decided to move on to a lower cost model that delivers the same level of quality in Ms. Balblair.  She offers the same orchard fruit aromas. Followed by the same chocolate-y taste, but at a more reasonable price.  I'm sorry, but in today's economic climate, we need to look at ways of maximizing ROI and reduce costs.  But, we're offering you a great severance package.  Also, please feel free to use us as a reference, should some other shmuck decide to pay your premium price."

4.0,"Ooooooh. The nose has red delicious apples that have been candied mixed with the biggest oranges you can imagine.  Nice bright spices and pineapple too.  The palate brings more awesome fruit cocktail, and no, not the canned crap. Orange gumdrops and whoppers mixed with some cinnamon sticks. Really damn nice. The finish is medium to long and reminds me of a stick of Juicy Fruit gum.  What a nice dram!  You may laugh at me, but this is “Kokomo” by The Beach Boys. 4.5. I love it! RIP Carl Wilson."
