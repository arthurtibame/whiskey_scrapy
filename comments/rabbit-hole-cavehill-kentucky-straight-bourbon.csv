P: Wow!! A liquid créeme brûlée! Vanilla and toasted sugar. Super creamy soft mouthfeel.
F: Soft with some oak and char but almost nothing"
4.5,"A little sweet corn on the nose & baking spices.  Sweet, baking spices, corn up front.  Oak & very mild hot that lingers in the throat!!!  A very good bourbon!!!"

3.25,"Nose: Immediate cereal grain - getting a brown ale vibe here, probably due to the higher malted barley content and wheat instead of rye in the mash bill.  Bananas, with some distant strawberry.  Brown sugar, but with an excess of molasses.  Some barrel, though not much.  Vanilla, nutmeg.  Very rounded - though we're at 95 proof, there's nothing bright or abrasive about the nose.  Very friendly.  Giving it a second and then a swirl reveals a little cinnamon and black pepper, though very muddled.  Think super cakey snickerdoodles without nearly enough cinnamon sugar on top.

Palate: Super friendly - that honeyed cereal grain quality definitely translates into the palate, though now there's some brightness, too.  Lemon oil and a touch of pine.  Vanilla, white sugar, oak, though we're staying away from harsh barrel territory.  Fruity - bananas, strawberries, maybe some stewed apples?  Lots of mid palate, but not much lower or upper - super focused and cohesive, nothing is really jumping out.  Again, very friendly.  Mouthfeel is medium light.

Finish: There's a pop of lemon oil, followed by mint.  Oak and tannin show up.  Bananas, cheerios, and cream.  Warm baking spices with just a touch of pepper.  We coast out on some anise, fruit, vanilla, oak.  Medium length finish.

Other notes: This stuff is different from my normal fare.  The unusually high barley content, wheat instead of rye, and higher corn content all play together for something a little unfamiliar, friendly, though ultimately a little young.  The flavors on display are cohesive and interesting, but are very mid-palate focused.  As usual, I'd love to try this straight from the barrel, as I feel like a more challenging version of this would be right up my alley.  I would definitely suggest this for those who are looking for an easy sipper - a ""background whiskey"" as some call it.  Probably wouldn't seek out again for myself, but not mad about the buy, either."

Bought this bottle back in May but just now getting to reviewing it. Rabbit hole is a relatively new distillery in Louisville, KY. This bourbon is a somewhat unique mashbill of 70% corn, 10% malted wheat, 10% honey malted barley, and 10% malted barley. The honey malted barley is primarily used in beer brewing. It’s bottled at a respectable 47.5% ABV and has to decent legs when swirled in a Glencairn. 

On the nose this bourbon is all buttery brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon and some dark tones of tobacco and leather. No alcohol burn at all, the nose is like sticking your nose in a warm cinnamon roll. Just beautiful. 

The palate is more of the same with some added pepper and baking spices. It’s a little drier than the nose suggests which is welcome; it’s sweet enough as it is. 

The finish is medium, warm, dry, with pepper and baking spices. There’s a new note that I can’t quite place: kind of green and bright in contrast to the rest of the dark, sweet, spicy notes. Green bananas maybe? It appears well after swallowing and hangs around quite a while. Not unpleasant, just very different. 

Overall this is a very good bourbon, very sippable neat. This was good enough I never bothered trying it in any cocktails; seems like it would be a waste. I think this was about $60 locally, a pretty decent value. 4/5. Cheers!"""
