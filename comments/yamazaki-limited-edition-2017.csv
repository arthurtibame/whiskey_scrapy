4.75,"Nose- Raspberry syrup, bananas, honey sweetness, fruit leather, mixed berries

Palate- Honey, cherries, sandalwood, herbal, banana, molasses 

Finish- Medium, thick and rich finish with notes of banana sweetness, honey, and a bit of wood spice

Man oh man. The nose on this is to die for. The palate is great too, but doesn’t quite live up to the expectations that the nose set. Regardless, it’s a delicious and enjoyable dram. Unmistakable raspberry and banana on the nose, that follows through to the palate and all the way to the finish. Nice honey sweetness and herbal notes round out the palate as well. As with any Yama... I feel the finish could be longer, but with all these delicious flavors, it’s very hard to complain about this one."
