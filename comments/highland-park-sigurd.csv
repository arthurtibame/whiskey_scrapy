4.25,A complex flavour while drinking. The nose has a slight iodine note. The Aftertaste is rich in roasted almond and honey.

4.25,"This is rich and has complex flavors from sherry casks. I’m guessing that there is some whisky in here that’s at least 16 years old, but there’s also some younger ones because it doesn’t quite achieve the fullness of HP age statement releases. Overall, a nicely presented and very good bottle to have. 94"
