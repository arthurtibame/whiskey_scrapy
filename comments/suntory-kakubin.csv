1.0,"Had to drink a bottle of this, mostly out of peer pressure, when I was in Japan. This whisky is the only unpleasant memory of my trip there. I remember this being very one-dimensional in terms of flavor and tasting solely of wood and honey. Probably should of had it in a highball."

1.5,"Japanese whisky tasting evening, Sydney 28 March 18, Whisky #1

          Nose: Cereal and ethanol, lightly fragrant with some faint, delicate fruit notes. A slight honey touch.

          Palate: Straightforward cereal arrival with a little spice. You do sense the grain component immediately. Smooth but thin texture with some faint citrus and honey sweetness developing.

          Finish: Short, some cereal sweetness. No bitterness or metallic notes.

          This was ""whisky zero"" of the night - the palate cleanser to set the scenery for the whiskies to follow. In that capacity it worked well. Not much chop as a sipping whisky - this is intended for highballs with lots of soda and ice.  In that form it would probably accompany sushi just fine.

          It just barely scrapes over the line to make 1.5 stars - one because it's not actively faulty in any way, and a half for being successful in its role as a mixer. Better than many lower shelf Scotch blends, but it is wildly overpriced for what it is - more expensive than JW Black Label.

""Adequate"" : 1.5 stars"

2.5,"Nose is sweet butter with a touch of honey and fresh orchard (green) apple, light floral note. Slight sharp spice note, possible ethanol-like touch but faint. Fragrant but simple. Pleasant, very friendly. Taste is similar to nose. Has a hint of something similar to licorice possibly at the end. Taste does not last long. Overall, not complex at all. VERY much Irish whisky like which is definitely the category I would put it in. Kudos for making a good budget Irish whisky that’s technically not Irish whisky. Simple but enjoyable for a budget. Drinks better than many budget Irish whiskies. Would mix very well. Worth a try for the buck if you are ever in Asia."

3.5,Really easy to drink that is suitable for breaking in first-time whisky drinkers.
3.5,"A Blended Japanese Whisky, that is intended for a large group of consumers. Bottled at 40%abv with a burnished color.

On the nose is rather light, i get brown cake with raisins, prune peel, vanilla, oranges, brown sugar, the smell of the branches that comes with grapes, and honey.

On the palate i found brown dry grasses, tobacco, clove, cereal, oak.  It is light bodied, and the aftertaste is medium long full of oakyness in a pleasant way.

Overall is a good dram, not good enough to buy a full bottle but interesting. 72/100"

2.0,"Nose: A mild but pleasant nose that mainly shows gentle cereal aromas plus a little orchard fruit. It's not deep or complex. A touch of light citrus and a little vanilla arises after some time resting in the glass.

Palate: The profile is soft and grainy with a sweet arrival tinged by a warm spice (mild ginger? faint cinnamon? white pepper?). The development is very fast and short with little coming through other than more light fruitiness - maybe some white grape and pale stone-fruits. The texture is pleasant but unremarkable.

Finish: Short. The mild cereal/fruit character dissipates into a spirity aftertaste with miniscule flourishes of vanilla and mint.

A pedestrian but acceptable whisky of shallow and inoffensive character. If I tasted this blind I would mistake it for a bottom-shelf Irish or grainy blended scotch. It's sippable, but is best used as a mixer in a highball, which I believe is the classic way of taking it in Japan.

The nose is quite spirity immediately after pouring so if drinking neat give it a little time (just a couple of minutes) and once the initial alcohol vapours burn away the softness becomes apparent.

The palate is clean and crisp but of no great moment, and the finish is short and unremarkable. You can taste the obvious presence of a lot of grain whisky in this, but it's of good quality. The malt component is exhausted during the development and the finish is dominated by flavours from the grain whisky and the sweetness of ethanol.

I reviewed this 2 years ago here and gave it 1.5 stars. This re-taste is based on a 30ml sample gifted me by a friend (than you, Wei). I did think it was a little richer this time and I'm increasing my rating to 2 stars.

However at the local price of AUS$70 a bottle this is not good value for money at all. If you want a light, crisp, cereal dominant blend for a highball you're much better off with Johnnie Walker Red Label, Cutty Sark or Black & White, all of which are nearly half the price.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars"

2.5,Never seen it in the States but when I was in Japan this was at 7 eleven and it was shockingly cheap and good. Not complex or interesting but maybe one of the best hard drinking whiskeys ever! Went down like water! Apple juice as a whiskey. Kinda like Canadian but even lighter
2.5,Highball
