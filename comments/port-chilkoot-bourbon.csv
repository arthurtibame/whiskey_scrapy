1.0,This tastes very unfinished to me. A step or two away from moonshine. Very harsh.
4.0,"As described when tasted neat. Good heat on the palate and nice finish. Stonefruits and vanilla come through well. Adding water gives it a brings out the vanilla and mellows just a bit, the heat still comes through. May be hard to find outside of Alaska, but worth a try if you see it!"
4.0,"Sampled first at the Brewhouse in Anchorage on Father's Day. It is an impressive offering for such a young Distillery; very smooth, nice legs, sweetness of the Corn, mellowed by aging, hints of vanilla & caramel, touch of cherry, slight note of licorice, and a warm lingering finish. If you can find a bottle, buy it. I found myself one, and it required a search. **** or an 86, if you prefer."
