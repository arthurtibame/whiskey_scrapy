4.5,I'm a huge fan of this bourbon - I will add tasting notes the next time I try it.  This bottle was actually bottled in the Fall of 2016.

null,I have the Fall 2016. Full bodied with vanilla and nice spice. The nose is stronger than the taste in a pleasant way. Maybe some nut flavors? That’s about the extent of my tasting abilities;-)

3.0,"Lots of oak, obviously, but very mellow.  Butter and butterscotch.  Not a fan of the regular double oaked, but this was a pretty good pour."
5.0,"Very heavy on the wood flavors and ""smoke"" profile.  A darker flavor than the regular Woodford"
