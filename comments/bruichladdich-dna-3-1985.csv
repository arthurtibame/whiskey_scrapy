5.0,"Nose - Zero ethanol burn, sweet dark dried stone fruits, orange custard, faint brine, hint of sweet nutty marzipan, hint of dark cocoa and freshly oiled leather.

Taste - Sweet black peppery spice, dark raisins, plums, and berries stewed in a sweet red wine, lightly drying, sweet tobacco, leather, white pepper heat, dark chocolate bitterness, very faint wisp of smoke.

Finish - Long lingering spicy fruity sweet, light fruity bitterness like that of grape seeds or apple peels, dark stone fruit sweets turns into golden raisin sweet, light smoky sea salt.

Score - 93/100

Final Thoughts - This is a truly remarkable dram on all fronts. Amazing nose, fantastic on the palate, and no off putting flavors on the long long finish. This is what happens when a whisky has had 25 years to patiently age in a barrel and marry together beautifully. I have a feeling there's at least a portion of some peated malt in this one but it has been tamed beautifully by 25 years in oak. It's very subtle and adds a nice hidden dimension to the dram that plays a supporting role and doesn't distract from the overall experience. Very well balanced and something I will be enjoying to the last drop of the bottle."
