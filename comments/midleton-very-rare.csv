null,84? 84? In what world is this an 84? I was expecting a 95 and would have expected anything above a 92. There is maybe 3 better Irish whiskeys in the world.

5.0,Not sure how this app rates at an 82. One o the finest whiskers you can imbibe. It I. Hard to say but it both seems both very complex yet extremely simple.
5.0,I love this whiskey.  Best I've had to date.  Much better than current rating on this app.

5.0,"Tried this sat at an Irish bar one night, not thinking that I liked Irish whisky. How wrong I was. Stunning. Beautiful, full flavour, with absolutely no burn whatsoever. If it wasn't £8 a nip, I think I'd have happily sat there all night and drained this 2013 release.
    It's important I own / drink a bottle of my own. Top shelf material !
  
  *I now own a bottle of the 2015 release. Happy days ! ☺"

Its a shame it's so expensive and a huge shame it has such a low rating. This is now my favorite whiskey. I really want to try the new batch finished in virgin Irish oak casks, hopefully it will be as good."

3.0,"My definitive opinion is in the name itself: a very rare occasion it will be before I choose to drink this whiskey again.  It already takes guts to release something WITHOUT AGE STATEMENT and sell it for $300 CAD, but then to be this disappointing... The nose is initially pleasant with notes of apples, but that quickly changes as an off-putting odour becomes prominent - imagine aged and slightly rotted wood. The palate has a nice touch of vanilla and caramel, with a finish that's extremely smooth though short, but by then the damage has irreparably been done."

4.0,"Nose: marmalade, toasted oats. Plenty of jam notes at front, so I may disagree w reviewer to some extent about fruit being subtle. Still, not surprisingly, Moreno is on target about the value. Even if I concede that this is a touch better than Green Spot or Redbreast, the price comparison gives strong edge to those two offerings. Finish is long, sweet, and pleasant... mostly vanilla."
3.0,It’s a pleasant enough whisky with the classic Irish character of light vanilla and coconut. The body is medium to light and my main issue with this - is that it doesn’t deliver for the money. I would expect and like some complexity of flavors for a price of 150 bucks
5.0,"Really good. Smooth with vanilla and caramel notes. Sometimes star ratings from reviews are more accurate than ""expert"" ratings."

On the tongue, the spices become present without punching you in the face. The finish is extremely smooth and pleasant. 

I wish this didn’t have a $150 a bottle price tag. It would make a wonderful everyday drinker."

5.0,"Tasted: 2016 ( a double - $50 gift card) and 2017 (Bottle x 2). Why rated so low? Is it the exquisite smoothness of these blends? Or maybe the absence of burn? As if that is needed to enjoy any whisky, especially one of this character. I know it took me a while to fathom the smooth complexity of this whisky. Something tells me it is the exclusivity and price for same which is responsible, as many today have become ultimate bargain seekers and will not settle for less. Well let them pass it over. There will simply be more for those of us who love it.
