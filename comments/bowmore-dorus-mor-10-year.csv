3.0,"In de neus komt wat zilt zeezout naar voor samen met wat geconfijte abrikoos en pruim, in de mond komt het gerookte op de voorgrond maar gevolgd door eerst wat citrus die blijft hangen naast de licht opgepompte fietsband!"

4.0,"Savory honey baked ham with tropical notes on the nose. Cherries and brine too. The palate brought out some minty freshness, and some basil first. Menthol-lyptus, bacon, vanilla, subtle lemon, and candied ginger. It also has a medium mouth coat, which is nice. Comes with a peppermint and chocolate finish. A little dry, but not bad. I'd say a 4.25. The theme to this dram should be ""Mint Car"" by The Cure."

4.0,"This is quite good.  It's a bit like an angry old man on the sea, with a little fruitiness thrown in.  It has a nice, edgy peatiness up front which is then followed by a salty tropical fruit run through the finish."
4.0,"An extraordinary scotch, particularly since it's just a 10-year old. If given the opportunity (and only 2,400 bottles were released) buy two; one to drink and one to collect.  Don't hesitate at the price (approx. $85), you will not get a second chance at this."

2.5,"What are you, Bowmore? Whisky or the syrup in canned fruit? Another one marred by unnecessary sweetness that takes over the palate. At least this bottling owns up to its Islay heritage with a decent blast of peat when awoken with a splash of water."

4.0,"I'm not as big a fan of Bowmore as I am of some of the other Islay distilleries.  However, this 10-year old Bowmore is about as pure an expression of Islay as one is likely to find.  This is an unfiltered, cask-strength, small-batch release that consists of only a handful of casks.  There have been three such limited releases to date, although I'm not sure which one we tried.  It's also found outside of the U.S. by a different name, Tempest.  It smells like fresh-baked oatmeal cookies and dry woodsmoke, but its flavors are much richer and fruitier than expected, with bursts of sweet berries, rich mulled cider, and a dash of sea salt.  That sea salt is what lingers on the tongue the longest.  This bottle is overpriced at well over $100 in most liquor stores, especially when compared to the equally puissant and even more memorable Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength (usually around $70-80).  Nonetheless, I'm glad I tried it; this is one of the best Bowmores that I've encountered."
4.0,"Subtle smokiness that comes out in taste. Fills my mouth in a good, not overwhelming way. Spicy in a not overwhelming way"
