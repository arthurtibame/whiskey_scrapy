3.25,Love the floral aromas
3.75,"Very green when first opened, needs time to oxidize and breathe in the glass.  Neck pour was terrible but pretty good after being opened for a few months."

4.25,"Even if i am getting a little bored about Macallan, i got to recognize them that their whiskies are a solid offer. This Macallan Lumina is one of the new expressions of the ""Quest Collection"" and i got it for around $100.

Bottled at 41.3% abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose is your typical Macallan, with the ""Milky way"" chocolate notes, dulce de leche and a slight herbal note. Yep, exactly as every other Macallan. (And that is not necessarily bad)

On the palate, it was a little surprising. Very spicy. Actually nice. Herbal, ginger, clove, chilli, lavender. It is a different offer. I liked it. 

Aftertaste was long and very rewarding. With ginger spice as the main flavor.

Overall i give this fine dram an 87/100, and i think it is a good whisky. Nothing to die for, but easy drinkable and enjoyable."

4.0,I had this at a Macallan tasting on a Caribbean cruise. A duty free product only I was told. NAS. Three casks used in the maturation I was also told. An oaky vanilla prominence on the nose and taste. Moderately complex. A cinnamon and pepper spice finish.
