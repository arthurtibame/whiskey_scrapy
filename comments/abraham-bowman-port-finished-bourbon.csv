4.0,"When you want something big and bold, look no further than Abraham Bowman. Distilled in 1994 and bottled in 2012, this beast is technically 18 years old (ish), but that’s not what makes it so special. What does then? How about 73.75 abv? Or to put it another way, 147.5 proof? That’s right, this thing will rush your senses and clear your sinus! Unlike other extremely high proof whiskies however (looking at you Redemption Barrel Proof), this will not power a small vehicle. Sorry folks. What this is though, is amazingly smooth while maintaining that initial kick. The finish is lively and long, and as it settles, the oak and vanilla slap you in the face. Great dram."
4.0,"You can definitely pick up the wine barrel finish as it adds a grape-y sweetness, but it finishes too dry for me to rate it higher."

2.0,Wildly mediocre. Harsh and immature for a twelve year old.

1.0,I just can’t get over the port finish of this bourbon.   It completely ruins it for me.   Could not even drink it mixed.    Horrible.
