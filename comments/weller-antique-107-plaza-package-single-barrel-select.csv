4.5,"The color is a translucent amber and it immediately leaves heavy trails of oils down the sides of the glass with each movement. The nose starts out with sweet, buttery, charred oak, with mild baking spices that nicely compliment it. Smooth caramel and brown sugar add to the sweet and creamy nose and a hint of floral fruitiness rounds everything out. The creaminess carries over to the palate with the oak making a strong showing, all while with a pleasant spiciness to it making for a rich and chewy mouthfeel. The finish is medium long with lingering dry oak, with spicy fruit taking its time to fade while the mouth maintains the creamy mouthfeel. Exceptionally enjoyable."
