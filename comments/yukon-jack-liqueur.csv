3.5,"Shots with my dad. Having a taster to be fair.

Nose is ethanol, honey sweet, and “whiskey-notes”

Taste is sweet and hot up front, then fades to a spicey, citrus, sweetness.

Finish is sweet and sour.

This liquor definitely works to keep you warm in the hoary north. Not a supper but I can appreciate the shot."

1.0,"After a forced hiatus in the hospital with pneumonia (Mrs Old Dude had to come to terms with the reality of my mortality) I’m providing a review on a liqueur I would not have previously considered. This is marketed as the “black sheep of whiskey” (a moniker which is quite apropos), however IMO this isn’t a whiskey at all... it’s more of a liqueur. Yes the base juice is some type of Canadian Whiskey but it’s not self evident. The nose, body and finish all scream FOOLED YOU! I typically drink my whiskey neat but the overpowering orange and honey sweetness make this virtually impossible to enjoy unmixed. The body is much more like orange flavored Delsym cough syrup, thick and slick except it’s sweet... blech. So why this review? One of my IHOP buddies says he wanted to help with my recovery, I think his motives were far more fiendish. I decided to take the highroad and resolved myself to find something to mix this whiskey imposter with without choking and retching. 

Conclusion: This is NOT a good whiskey, in fact it barely qualifies as a whiskey... but it makes a really good hot tea toddy. When I’m sick with a cold, flu, whatever, I drink tea toddies, normally with a bit of brandy. I’m English, tea toddies make me feel better, and if you have enough of them you don’t care how bad you feel anyway. I use Bigelow black tea, make it hot and strong, let it steep and add a shot, no honey or sweetener - jeepers this stuff is sweet enough. This isn’t good for nothing whiskey, it’s a good for one thing whiskey - a hot toddy. Because of that one reason I’ll give it 1.5⭐️ but I have to deduct .5 ⭐️ for basically impersonating a whiskey. So for now it’ll be resting comfortably on my bottom shelf (with the rest of my liqueurs) until the next time I’m feeling under the weather, and it won’t move until then..."
