1.5,"This is a local, San Diego County, product I found a few months ago at Costco. There was not much info available about this whiskey, but I'm always happy to support and try out local products, so I figured I'd buy a bottle. From the info I did find, it is an extremely small batch, single barrel product and there seems to be a great variation on the end results. On to the tasting:
Initially model glue, then latex paint, and finally, faint berries on the nose. The palate has a rubbery, semi-sweet corn syrup taste. The finish is medium length and a bit spicy.
Not the worst whiskey I've ever tasted, but not very good."
