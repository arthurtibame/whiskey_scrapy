5.0,"I bought this as I was down to my last drops of 18. I was eager to compare the two heavy-weights side by side. Rare is elegant and smooth and old. The dark fruits and old leather dance beautifully together in your mouth. The finish is sticky and keeps going and going. I found myself licking my gums long after my glass was empty. 18 is bolder, a bit more smoky and not quite as aged. Both are wonderful, and I can see cases on both sides for which is the better bottle, but I give a slight edge to the rare cask. It is now my bar for which all other drams will be measured."
