4.5,"Neeley Family Distillery Moonshine is Kentucky Proud, and Triple Pot-Distilled from sweet corn and cane sugar.  The nose is very clean, and not ""hot"" for 60.1%.  The balance of the corn and cane is truly harmonious, and is showcased on the palate, in the mouth-feel, and in the finish.  This is a very clean, well crafted moonshine, and not just one to rush on the shelves, or a gimmick.  This is the best store bought, or illicit moonshine that I've had!  Kudos!!!  Kentucky Proud, and made with pride!!  My score was 91."
