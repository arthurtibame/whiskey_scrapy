5.0,In comparison to other barrel proofs I felt this had the most smooth flavor. A little bit of burn up front but calm finish. Classic vanilla and caramel. The high proof is well hidden. That along with it matching my prefered flavor profile is why I rated it so high

4.0,"This bourbon really hits the spot.   Sweet and strong.   Lots of wood,  oak, leather and tobacco in the mid palate but opens up and finishes with maple and brown sugar.   You won't see it in the flavor profile graph below but I get a nicely balanced saltiness in my 129  proof.   It's like baking salt...   Just there to add complexity to the sweetness.   Strong burn you can cut with an ice cube.   Still super smooth for a high proofer.   Every bottle of CEHT is amazing.   Don't pass up a chance to try this unique expression.   It's raw and delicious!"

5.0,"One of my absolute favorites! Incredibly smooth for a barrel proof. Sweet and spicy yet with a creamy/oily character that coats your palate. Incredibly long, rich legs on the glass too. When poured the nose is tight but give it some time and it's heaven. Candy Corn, wood, tobacco, vanilla, cinnamon. Drinking neat is my preferred way to enjoy this beauty however I've had it with one ice cube and it's just as delicious. Enjoy!"

The batch from 2015 at 127.2 proof tastes like Eagle Rare 17 at a high proof, with more oak.  For my personal preference, the 2015 batch is far superior. [2nd tasting of the 129 proof last night. It has opened up. It's now tasting very similar to the 127.2; still similar to Eagle Rare 10 on the nose, but the flavors coming through now are without that metallic character] Not enough consistency from batch to batch. I tasted the 127.5 and it was awful"

Taste - (w/o water) Sweet cherry vanilla, strong cinnamon/white pepper heat/tingle/burn, light drying sweet oak, coke concentrate (w/ water) Significantly less oak, more cinnamon sweetness, cherry vanilla latte foam sweet.

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering white pepper/cinnamon burn, lingering hot cherry-vanilla sweetness, similar to a super carbonated cherry-vanilla coke, hint of oddly medicinal oak (w/ water) Less burn, more lightly oaked, like you just drank a cherry-vanilla bitters topped bourbon highball

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - This was amazingly a lot lighter on the nose than I had expected for a 60+% ABV offering, but maybe that's because my nose and palate have gotten used to the higher proof. Regardless, this one drinks quite a bit hot out of the bottle and although it's full of flavor as it is, I think it greatly benefits from a tiny bit of water to soften out the ethanol burn a bit and allows the flavors to bloom a bit more. The intense sweetness is toned down quite a bit, but it makes it an infinitely more sip-able bourbon with a splash of water. Price point is a tiny bit high (but that's probably because I'm in WA State) but this is definitely something I would consider grabbing another bottle of since it's value can be extended with adding a tiny bit of water to each dram."

129.7 proof

Pour at a bar since I can never find a bottle. $16/2oz pour

Nose: fresh raspberries are the first thing I immediately pick up on. Honestly smells like a boozy raspberry pie. Really nice pastry notes to accompany the fruit. Blueberries and vanilla also make an appearance. Probably the most berry forward nose I’ve experienced in a bourbon. Let’s see if these fruit notes carry over to the palate. 

Palate: lots of spice off the bat. I suspect a fair amount of rye went into this mashbill. Blueberries carry over to the palate more than the raspberries. Big hit of mouth-drying oak upon delivery. With a little water, vanilla comes out in decent doses. 

Finish: medium finish length. Vanilla carries over from the palate and lingers for a while. Not getting any of the previous fruity notes from the nose and palate. 

Overall: man, I wish I could find a bottle of this stuff. So far I’ve only been able to get the small batch and single barrel offerings. The barrel proof has to be my favorite that I’ve tried from the EH Taylor line so far. The nose is the standout here for me. The berry/bakery scents just come up every time I go for a sniff. Very enjoyable bourbon overall. 

Cheers!"

4.5,"Reviewing Batch 7 (2018), proof is 129.7

This week has been my most successful week hunting Bourbon in a very long time. I was not only able to purchase this bottle for $56.89 but also a bottle of Elmer T Lee for $35.99. Both are bottles I have never previously been able to find at or below SRP!

So what makes this bottle so sought after? Let's dive into some details:

1) It is distilled and aged at Buffalo Trace and is made with the #1 Mashbill (less than 10% rye) same as George T Stagg and Stagg Jr
2) It's an NAS release, however the age is estimated to be between 7-9 years old.
3) It's only released once a year and is by far the most allocated of the EH Taylor core range (secondary prices are $350+)
4) It's the only EH Taylor release that does not have a BiB designation (due to a proof greater than 100)

Let's dive into the notes:

Mouthfeel: Rich very mouthcoating and oily

Entry: burnt brown sugar, vanilla dipped blueberries and caramel

Mid palette: cinnamon, tobacco and oak

Finish: very long and oak driven with rich toffee, leather and wood spices

As a frame of reference I tasted this side by side with Stagg Jr 127.9 batch and this was smoother and richer. Definitely a step up from Stagg Jr which is brash next to it. 

For the price paid it's hard to find any fault with it. I knock 1/2 a point for a slight lack of complexity but it's really nit picking. 

Cheers All!"

4.75,Dynamic bourbon.  Oak on the nose with some subtle sweetness.  High proof but nose doesn’t show it.   Rich flavors hit the mouth immediately.  Long pepper hit on the back that hangs deliciously.
4.5,"This E.H. Taylor expression -- Batch 7, from 2018 -- was my surprise favorite of a night where I also tried three Four Roses Private Selections, Kentucky Owl Bourbon (Batch 8), and 2018's George T. Stagg.  I've had pours of earlier batches of this barrel-proof bourbon, and they never left a lasting impression on my mind.  This newest release, dating from 2018, is astoundingly good and almost tastes like a sherry-finished whiskey.  Raisin is readily detectable from the first sniff, along with dense blackberry preserve or compote.  The fruit flavors on this one rival, or perhaps even exceed, the intensity of the Kentucky Owl.  Despite being considerably younger than the Stagg, its palate had the strongest oak backbone and the most mouth-watering maple syrup note.  It was incredibly viscous and full-bodied.  The one slight flaw would be the overwhelming heat on the finish: turmeric, cinnamon, pie, and sweet tea giving just a glimmer of relief from that spice and alcoholic fire."

4.25,phenomenal! Carmel char goodness glad I got to have
4.5,"Definitely a bucket list whiskey.  I was super excited to find this for what I'd consider a very reasonable price and boy did it deliver.  I should point out I tried this after the WLW so it's possible my flavors were a little confused.

Nose: Wood, lots of it, light vanilla, some alcohol burn.  Not a lot going on in the nose and very simple unlike the complexity of the taste.

Flavor: Toasted walnuts and pecans, some wood, vanilla, baking spices, light honey sweetness but not cloyingly sweet.  A very unique flavor.  Like nothing I've tasted before.

Finish: Medium length, oak leading in to some rye spice, red hots, cinnamon, and waxy walnut or brazil nut.

This was excellent!  If only I could find a bottle for a reasonable price.  I recently saw one for $300 but...really???"
4.25,"Bottle pour neat at Partisan DC.  Decent price of $14 for a high-end DC spot.  Spicy oak, caramel, and vanilla on the nose.  Taste has more heat and more spice, some complex grains playing around.  Very long finish, tons of character here.  I really enjoy this.  7/3/19"

5.0,"Wow. Just wow. This is some seriously elegant and tasty $h1t. It smells like fresh honeycomb and melted butter. The taste is sweet and smooth, almost playful. It's creamy and butter, kind of like a sweet, hot, honey-filled croissant. Despite the high proof this whiskey doesn't have a strong bite. It's warm and sweet on the finish, but quite approachable."
4.25,"Neat from a Glencairn glass

Beautiful amber color. 

Nose it’s actually surprisingly light on this one. Oak, cinnamon, honey and corn. 

On the palate, there’s the barrel proof! Spicy toasted oak, dark chocolate, cinnamon and a slight herbal note. The proof is not overpowering. 

Finish is long, ultra smooth and slowly fades. Spice and oak lingers with a touch of honey for the finale. Not very much sweetness. 

I love barrel proofs and this one is definitely different and leans to the spicier side."
5.0,All I can say is damnnmm. It was awesome. Tried it up against the ECBP A119(which I loved) and it ruined me on the A119 as in made it tough to drink. maybe my low hoped for the EHTBP is what made it shine but it was great

3.5,"2018 edition.  

Nose - Dusty corn, big caramel sweetness, strong oak notes (think fresher oak, not charred), a hint of cherry fruit.  This has a very classic buffalo trace nose where you almost feel like you're in their rick houses when you get those oak notes. 

Taste - Fruity, vanilla, creamy velvety oak, and a huge caramel background.  I get a lot of citrus, cherry, and just a waxy fruit note.  This is one of the most fruity buffalo trace bourbons I've had, don't get me wrong, this is a classic bourbon with vanilla, caramel and oak dominating.  last note, just got it but there's a bit of a nutty character just before the citrus fruits come into play.  

Nose - 2.75
Taste - 4.0
Mouth Feel - 3.5
Finish - 3.5

So for me that's a 3.5.  Doesn't really justify the price on the secondary market."

4.5,This baby is a floral bomb on the nose but not so much on the palate. I get very sweet Carmel some citrus and heat at 129.7. I feel as if this is more in tune with BT than EHT SmB or EHT SiB. It seemed more like a BT Barrel proof than EHT.Maybe I am crazy but if you have a change to get this at retail get 2.
4.75,I really appreciate this app but come on your review is from 2013 and maybe your assessment of the 2013 batch is accurate but the 129 proof batch is far different. I understand that there are a million distillers out there but I think the big 5 should get fairly regular updates.
4.25,"The nose starts with baking spices balanced by oak and vanilla, followed by brown sugar and cinnamon. The palate is dry but coats the mouth and is spicy with black pepper and strong cinnamon, balanced nicely by oak, vanilla, caramel and brown sugar. The finish is long and spicy with fading oak, vanilla and the slightest hint of cherry syrup."

4.0,"Minimal nose. Sweet and honeyed palate. Long fire finish

4.0,"This rich sweet-forward pour BRINGS THE HEAT. The nose easily detects caramel, molasses, baked brown sugar and cinnamon. The palette is immediately hit with a burn and peppery spice on the tip of the tongue, while sweet flavors of molasses and vanilla flow over the sides of tongue in back. A thick mouth feel that’s enjoyable while the heat flairs up and spreads throughout your mouth, throat, and body. I added several drops of water from a straw, several times. I want to try their lower ABV for comparison. Might enjoy it better.  Usually, I lean toward high proof for complexity and richness and feel the burn isn’t as noticeable after the 3rd or 4th sip. Not the case with this Taylor, that burn never seemed to let up until water was added and many sips were taken.  I did have a rough spot on my tongue which may have affected that."

The nose has green apple, milk chocolate, raisins, maple syrup, a hint of baking spices and baked bread.

The palate is sweet and oily, but not too thick. I get green apple, chocolate, buttery caramel, a little bit of leather, oak. It is fairly drying on the palate, which is to be expected from a high proofer. Very tasty.

The finish is nice, long and sweet with lingering rich caramel and green apple, while the tip and side of your tongue tingles. 

Wow, this is very good. I love how it sticks to the E.H. Taylor profile, but just bumped up a lot."

Nose- plum, cinnamon rolls, molasses, oak, tart apples, caramel, prunes, vanilla

Palate- Dark fruits, vanilla wafer cookies, heavy toasted oak, maple syrup

Finish- long, drying finish of wood, cocoa and ginger spice

Good nose. Quite complex and hides the alcohol well. Palate is pretty simple, yet enjoyable. I’m kind of torn on this one... while it does have some unique flavors and smells, I found myself not enjoying it as much as other EHT offerings."

4.25,"It smells spicy like paprika. The flavor is really full and robust. There's plenty of spice, but it isn't overly pronounced. It's very rich with some interesting earthiness that mixes well with the cocoa. There's a lot of vanilla and some burnt sugar. There's a large dose of kind of generic fruit. The flavors here are quite good. The vanilla lingers on the finish, adding some needed sweetness. There's quite a bit of vanilla, but it is well balanced. The herbal note is a bit odd but not wholly unlikable. This is a really impressive bourbon. With water added, more fruit and toffee come out on the nose. More rye comes out with water added, but it still doesn't overwhelm. The spice becomes more piercing with sharp pepper and clove bites. It becomes more bitter as well with the water. The bitterness tastes like wood with some herbal and orange juice notes. It's quite harsh with the water, actually, and it's also a bit more floral. I'm not as thrilled by this when water is added, but it is still quite complex and tasty despite the intense harshness. It's a great bourbon. I like the minimal tartness, though I'd actually prefer a little less. I really wish that the spiciness were less challenging, but I love the richness and complexity. The notes are all quite good too. There's a lot more maple once the water opens it up, but the spice and wood are still there. This isn't exceptionally sweet, but it is balanced."

Don’t start sipping too soon. She needs to breathe. Though, fresh baked apple pie will take your breath away once it finally hits your lips. The burn is the right amount. 

Man, I don’t wanna brush my teeth ever. The finish is immaculate. Dark chocolate lingers for hours (minutes). Spearmint and cherries, too. Lovely, lovely drink. 

It’s about as viscous a whiskey I’ve ever had. The thing about well-done barrel-proof bourbon is shown here. Big smells. Big flavors. Big finish. And, just enough burn to remind you who’s in charge."

Great legs in the glass. The palate is incredible. Sweet brown sugar, fruits, molasses, on the front end. The back is absolutely vicious, it hurts so good. Great moutfeel. Spice, pepper, and oak on the backend, but that molasses is still there. The spice and molasses fight it out in a very long finish with the spices eventually winning out. Truly exceptional.

Nice thick, coating mouth feel.  Getting this overwhelming sense of vanilla frosting.  Wave after wave of vanilla frosting.  Almost like Oreo filling even.  An intense sweetness I wasn’t expecting.  It’s easing its way into a cherry cola.   Cherry and vanilla dance all over the legs.

5.0,"2019 release 64.65% (129.3 proof)

Powerful and ultra complex nose of Charleston Chew candy, golden raisin, date, fig, plum, tobacco, leather, sea salt, pepper, cedar, alfalfa, and bubblegum (but not just any bubblegum Bazooka Joe specifically) Yes all those are actually detectable; the aromas are distinct and easy to pick out. Probably one of the most complex noses I have ever huffed. What’s almost hilariously absent in the nose is “cinnamon”, “barrel spices”, and “char” standard aromas found in a million other bourbons. 

RICH flavor. The bourbon equivalent of eating an entire chocolate cake. So. Much. Caramel. Underneath that, you have all the flavors in the nose above with the fruits (date, fig, plum) and tobacco standing out. Praline, cumin, tamarind and a bit of umami taste in the mid-palate which is just crazy. “Decadent” comes to mind. Finish is super long; everything in the front palate just sort of carries on along with some heat without changing much which is a feature not a bug when you have something this intricate. Maybe a wisp of dark chocolate once all the other flavors and heat have  faded. Delicious.

Full, viscous, creamy mouthfeel. 

I paid 129.99 retail on this because it may be my only chance to ever score a bottle. Was it worth it? While I have had other 5 star bourbons for less, I still can’t help but feel I got my money’s worth. It’s that good. Not sure I’d drop that much change again, but if I walked away from another chance to buy a bottle I’d definitely be sad."
