3.0,More like an ordinary whisky compared to th wheat version. Interesting licorice root in the nose. Strong and kind of herby in the taste.

5.0,"Definitely deserves more than the pathetic 85 point score that the reviewer gave it. Even then, Masterson's straight rye puts this delightful take on a single grain to shame."
4.0,"Spicy and full-bodied with a hint of caramel lingering on the pallette.  Pretty smooth for a 92.  It was served from a wooden barrel where I ordered it, so that may have mellowed it a bit."
