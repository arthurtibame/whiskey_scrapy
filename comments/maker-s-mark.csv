The taste is smooth I want to say cherries but I am inexperienced, yet greeted up front with something delicious and sweet.  For sure slight tastes of coffee and vanilla, hits of caramel, and that sweet sweet bourbon flavor you come to love. Little burn, little sweet. Easily in my top 5"

4.25,I’ve drank makers for a while now but this is my first tasting note. Color is you typical whiskey-gold. Nose has a soft sweetness of vanilla and buttered toast. Palate is noticeably light and smooth; vanilla and pear. Finish is also light and smooth but has lingering oak. A classic whiskey I would recommend to a beginner due to the lightness/smoothness of being a wheated bourbon.

3.5,"Here's a review that's long overdue. College parties, dive bars, family reunions, weddings--you name it, Maker's has been there for me when I'm in a pinch. Generally, when attending some function with an open bar, this is the best drink that will be available. Maker's has been a part of some really great times, and has gotten me through some events that I was less-than pleased to be dragged along to. Time to give ol' reliable a proper review.

Nose: Brown sugar, caramel, and toffee are the dominant notes. There's also vanilla, Gala apple, cinnamon, black pepper, and oak. A little leather and tangy orange citrus. And touch of walnut/toasted almond. Standard bourbon profile--it does nothing to amaze but there's also nothing to complain about. It's quite nice.

Palate: More of the leather, brown sugar, and caramel. Now with some cocoa. Vanilla and toffee. The walnut/toasted almond make a much more prominent appearance.  A bit of apricot. I read ""lemon tea"" somewhere on internet--I can't take credit for that but I must say that it fits perfectly. Cinnamon, black pepper, oak, clove, nutmeg, and allspice round off the sweetness with a bit of a spicy kick.

Finish: Cocoa and roasted almond. Brown sugar, caramel, and brown sugar remain a constant. More of the cinnamon, black pepper, baking spices, and oak from the palate--though now the oak presents itself as bitter as opposed to the barrel-char I got on the palate. Medium-length.

Always enjoyable. It was one of the first whiskies I really enjoyed, so I'm certain this one has shaped my preferences to this day. At $32, it's one of the cheaper high-quality whiskies I can buy in my area. It's standard, it's simple, but it's always a safe bet.

3.5 stars for Maker's Mark's flagship bottling. Worth keeping in any home bar. We've all been dragged places we really do not want to go. For me, no matter where I find myself, the sight of that red wax seal is a good omen. A true classic."
3.0,"Nose: sweet cherry vanilla and brown sugar

Taste: more cherry and sugar followed by strong oak and some nail polish

Finish: bitter spicy oak that fades into sweet

The bitterness in this really prevents me from enjoying it as much as I might otherwise on its own. Makes a good old-fashioned."

Finish is medium to long, but that's not necessarily a good thing for this one.  I got this as a gift and I just can't see myself buying this.  Would order at a bar if if was the only choice aside from rail bourbon."

For me, buttery kettlecorn is the predominant note, but I also get a little smidgen of cola and/or pomegranate.  And as another reviewer mentioned, there’s a sharp oak char there as well.  That and the shiny 45% alcohol give it a jagged edge I really like.  It’s not complicated, but it’s such a steal at $23.  I think if it were less available and more expensive, the pros would rate it more highly."

As for the taste: pretty straightforward, just some barrel char and lots of sweetness in the form of cherry, vanilla, and caramel. Not very spicy (no rye) and no astringency at all. The only unpleasant note is a slight medicinal quality that dissipates with a few minutes.

Would make a good daily drinker for sure."

3.0,"Nose is sweet with cherry and a bit of vanilla, followed by yeasted bread notes. Sips smooth on palate and starts with cherry and finishes with a bit of spice. 

A pretty sweet bourbon, perfect for sipping neat, but add a few drops of water and it lightens it up, reminding me of many of the Canadian whiskeys we have up here despite there being no rye in this mash bill."

3.75,"It's been a few years since I had Maker's Mark. The last time I tried it was 6 years ago, so I thought I'd revisit it. 

On the nose, I get vanilla and rich fruits. Almost like peaches and cream. Maybe some berries in there too. Its a sweet, rich smelling whiskey with some strong ethanol burn.
On the taste, its sweet with some vanilla and cherry. There's some burn there. It has an decently long oaky finish too.

Next, I poured myself another wheater, Weller SR, for a comparison. Weller has brighter, sour fruit notes on the nose. Makers seems richer and more dense. The taste of the Weller is lighter and has a thinner mouthfeel while the Makers has a caramel, burnt marshmellow hint that comes and goes. The finish for the Weller is less oaky/tannic than Makers, but its much more dry. I'm having a hard time deciding which one I like more. Still this is a solid value for ~$20 in my area and happy that its easy to find. Cheers!"

For being a 45 abv which isn't too high but, definitely slightly above average, it almost tastes watered down to a much lower abv. Orange peel on the finish and it's about a medium finish. Not something I'd request or reach for but, not bad either."

Bottled at 45%abv, russetmusscat color.

On the nose is very Bourbonish, grapes, prunes, vanilla, cream, cola and a little amount of pepper notes. 

On the palate is a little harsh, starts with caramel, then switches to hot oak, slightly spicy and the finish is short, with tobacco notes.

Nose - vanilla and ethanol. Some light oaky spices

Overall and value - love the sweet notes on the palate and how easily drinkable it is. Great overall bourbon that is easily found from 20-25$ making it a great value. Style points to the bottle with the unique bright red wax."

There is nothing wrong with this whiskey, but it doesn't really stand out either.  I don't agree with much of the professional review with the exception of the oak and spearmint.

I have no idea why I waited so long to try this. I guess I was so distracted by all of the options we now have that I neglected to try some of the classics. A darn shame. 

This is honestly pretty good. It displays your typical, sweet and floral wheater flavor but still has enough body and richness to be a solid contender. In terms of wheated bourbons, I’d place this ahead of Larceny but behind Weller SR. Since Weller is nearly impossible to find at a decent price, I guess Maker’s will be my go-to when I’m craving something wheaty. I’ve tried it neat, on the rocks and in an old fashioned, and it’s very pleasant and smooth any way you choose to drink it. 


There’s not a ton of depth to it, but I really can’t find much to complain about, especially when price is taken into consideration. It’s a smooth, sweet, no-frills whisky that’s easy to relax with at the end of a long day. 

I can definitely see how this was once considered a “premium” bourbon, but there are others in the ~$25 category that have a little more to offer. Still, a great bourbon and always available at a good price. 

I’ll be eager to try the other MM offerings and see how they compare."

3.5,"(did blind next to Larceny, which is important)  
Like many, Maker's is a gateway bourbon for me, so it holds a warm spot in my heart.  As noted I did this blind, so I didn't have any label loyalty.  In fact, I was wrong and thought it was Larceny.  
Bright Copper in color, Aroma was so light I couldn't understand it. Weakest part of the experience in my mind.  
Flavor of caramel and nutty. Really floral in the flavor (aroma?? none) a moment of a medicinal quality that I later took to baking spice/clove.   More nutty as it opens.  3 Drops of water were interesting.  Nothing, and I mean nothing at first.  But much later really opened and became a bit more nutty.   
So, Makers beat out Larceny in  my mind, if anyone cares.  (blind)"
