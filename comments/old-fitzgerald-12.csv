4.0,"Great nose, baking spices, caramel, and flowers. Some sort of sour vanilla as well. Strong wood initially on the palate, a bitterness that lingers. A quick hit of brown sugar, then leather and turpentine. Sometimes I get a flash of overripe orchard fruit. The finish is long and spicy. Lots of flavor in this one. 9/13/17"

5.0,"Got a bottle of this from a friend, pretty good stuff, definitely follows up with regular Old Fitz. Solid nose with the notes we're familiar with spicy, leathery, woody, with a clean and crisp finish."

4.0,"Another one where the 5-point scale doesn't do justice...this is better than 4, but not quite 5.  In any case, the nose is a bit woody, with sugarcane and butter hints mixed with alcohol astringency.  The palate, fortunately, is much better.  Rich butterscotch coats the tongue, intermingled with baking spices and just a hint too much wood before leading to a dry, sweet finish.  Very surprised at the amount of spice in this considering there's no rye in the mashbill. A really good variant of the wheated whiskys; better than Maker's Mark, on-par with (yet very much different than) Maker's 46, but not quite as good as Weller's 107.   Give this a try if you find traditional wheated bourbons too sweet, or if you're looking for a little more ""smooth"" than in your regular rye-blend drams."
