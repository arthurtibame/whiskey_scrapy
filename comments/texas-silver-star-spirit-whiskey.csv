2.0,"Smooth blended whiskey.  Light in color.  Lacks the deep and rich flavors of a scotch whisky.  Some hint of spice and oak with vanilla on the finish.  Balanced; good for those looking to drink neat without the burn.  Adding water/ice or including in a mixed drink and the whiskey's flavor almost disappears. I had hoped for a deeper flavor profile like the offerings from fellow Texas whiskey producer Balcones, but this falls short."
