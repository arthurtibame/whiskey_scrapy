4.0,"OBS single barrel pick
116.5 proof

N: vanilla, honey, wheat bread, light brown sugar, very little ethanol for cask strength, some pear and tobacco on the back end of the pour
P: thin, honey, caramel, fair bit of cinnamon and spice, a bit of apple
F: pretty long and hot, the proof that is hidden on the nose and palate comes through here, lots of spice

This noses and sips like an 80 proof wheater, but finishes like a 120 proof rye. Both are nice but the transition is more jarring than ideal."

4.25,"Color and viscosity of slightly reddish-amber olive oil

N: Cherry and Apricot, honey and malty with hints of hazelnut, Honeynut Cheerios

P: light and sweet early but turns surprisingly earthy and oaky midpalate.

F: Long and Rye-forward, switching between sweet grains and spice.

Bought this basically blind and am glad I did. I don't recommend adding water, because the malt becomes overpowering. A good pour neat!"
