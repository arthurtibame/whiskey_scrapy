2.0,"One the nose; notes typical of a young bourbon, despite being an 8 year, and most forward with caramel and hints of maple syrup. On the palette; spiciness that hits the tip of the tongue and slowly evolves around the sides and to the back of the throat. Some subtle tannins coming in, quickly overshadowed by a vanilla finish. Overall, tastes very young and a little sharp for a 90 proof, 8 year, bourbon. Easy to drink, however, the shelf price seems to be representative of the age and bottle branding but seems a tad high compared to the actual quality."

2.0,"A shockingly young smelling and tasting whiskey, given the 8 year age statement. Earthy, peanut butter, peanut brittle, leather, chalky vanilla. Just a touch of honeycomb, apple, peach. There's some sweetness, but the whole affair is a bit thin, and proceedings are dominated by a green-ish, youthful, corn husk, vegetal sort of character. It's a non distillery product, so who knows where it comes from, but it has some flavours I associate with Beam.  It's not heinous; it's just not remotely worthwhile at the price point: tastes too young, raw, washed out, and even a bit faintly sour."

4.0,"Coconut macaroon, creme de menthe, vanilla, cherry cobbler and peanut shells on the nose. The palate hits spicy, hot and tight with earthy mint, anise and leather, then slightly tangy fruit notes  until ultimately settling into toasty notes of firewood, cocoa, and espresso bean. The finish is long and brings off-sweet notes of dark chocolate sea salt caramel. Really lightens up with an ice cube and tames the heat and sweet."

3.75,"A light, rusty copper color. Licorice, moldy oak and corn on the nose. Oak hits first on the palate, followed quickly by a nice hit of orange jelly. Getting a nice “Fruit Stripes Gum” nuance at the very finish along with a subtle, slow burn. Nice legs on the glass and a smooth, well-rounded mouthfeel. Sure, I’d love to experience a richer, more complex flavor profile...but this one’s not bad for the low price point. 3.65."
3.25,"Nose - Caramel and vanilla upfront on top of dark fruit, with oak, brown sugar, licorice and a touch of honey in the background. 

Palate - Caramel, cherry and grain are predominate with rye, vanilla, oak and a hint of orange building up behind it. 

Finish - Caramel and vanilla are balanced nicely by an oak spiciness that slowly fades."
5.0,"Not the best out there, but for the price point and age it's not bad at all"
