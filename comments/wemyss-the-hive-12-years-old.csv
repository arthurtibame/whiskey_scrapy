3.25,"A Blended Malt, that won a Silver medal in the International Spirits Challenge in 2012. As the name implies, the whole mood of this dram is honey.

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose: Cola. Darker aromas like coffee and chocolate. Almonds. A dim honey note and Caramel. I thought it would be a honey madness but it is not. 

On the palate: Very easy drinkable. Honey and almonds. Peanuts. Dry fruits. A little oaky, but pleasant.

Aftertaste is very rewarding and easy, honey and almonds, vanilla powder. A hint of clove spice.

I don't think this is a bad dram at all. This is just a more easy going / not so complex whisky, it might be great for begginers. Not my cup of tea, but not bad. 68/100."
