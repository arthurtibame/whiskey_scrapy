3.0,Young. ABV comes through. Wish it was less harsh on the finish. Fair amount of spice on palate makes up for it to a degree.
4.0,Interesting rye from start to finish. Ethanol and leather on the nose with a small hint of mint. Entry is Hot but mellows to a spearmint spice almost mouthwash like. Finish brings in a hint of oak and spice with the mint still at the forefront. Young whiskey at barrel strength so some of this I expected what I remain surprised at is the minty flavor. Nice pour at the price under 40 dollars but not yet fully refined as a must buy. 3.5 stars with the value. Love what Willett is doing because this is a unique expression of rye from what I have tried. Cheers!

3.0,"Nose is hot, with a floral quality. Cracked pepper, nutmeg, coconut, candied pineapple, stewed apples, & menthol. More cooked tropical fruits and spice on the palate amidst the oak. Bitter barrel char, mint, pine, menthol with a slightly buttery texture. Finish is long, oaky and spicy (like cayenne spicy). There was something I couldn't quite put my finger on throughout the whole dram (to the extent that I can ever find useful words, in the first place). I liked this one a lot more than the two-year, but still a little too sweet for me, even at cask strength."

5.0,"Fruity and somewhat sweet, a rye that tastes like no other rye. It's especially different from most ryes which are sourced from MGP/LDI. Only other rye which comes close and may even be slightly better (or at least more traditional bourbon tasting) is Colonel EH Taylor Rye (despite it having no corn in the mashbill). Extremely rare, as this is the oldest non-MGP/LDI sourced Willet rye, and therefore supposed to be much more unique and better than even the 10+ year old Willet rye sourced from MGP/LDI."

5.0,"Blind tasting sample from Aaron Stark. 
Thank you!

Nose: Sherry and tawny port. Overripe plums and figs. 
Palate:
Same overripe stewed fruit. Salt and minerality. Chlorides, calcium, and light sulphur. Oily slick texture but medium-light body. Estery and alcoholic but clean, not fusel, hot, or solventy. 
Finish: more fermented character. Fruit skins, coriander seed. Vegetable oil. Perfume spice, lavender and mace. 

Overall, I enjoyed how unique and harmonious the fermented fruit character was even if there wasn't a ton of complexity. The flavors were deep and they worked with the texture and body almost masterfully."

Proof: 110.4 (55.2%)
Age: 3 Years
Mashbill: Blend Willett Low Rye and High Rye: 51% Rye, 34% Corn, 15% Malted Barley & 74% Rye, 11% Corn, 15% Malted Barley
Distillery: Willett Distillery, Bardstown, KY
Price: $40 - $50

Palate: Sweet at first sip, slightly floral, spicy, hint of banana, smallest hint of dried fruit
Finish: Medium-Long finish, warm, rye spicy, oak, hint of dried bananas, a little bit dry
Personal Rating: 7/10
Notes: I really enjoyed Willett 3 Year Rye. Still new to “tasting” ryes, but I would definitely go back to this bottle. I love the hints of banana that I picked up, it made for a very pleasurable pour that balanced out the spice from the rye. Adding a few drops of water could likely open up the flavor some more and bring forth some of the subtle dried dark fruit flavors in there. It isn’t the easiest to find here in the Chicago burbs (Binny’s had one bottle in the back storeroom), but the price is extremely reasonable for the quality you get from this bottle. If you see it in a shelf, go ahead and pick it up"

With a few drops of water, nose is spearmint and lemon grass and tastes likewise. 

Would buy, def recommend a few drops of water to tone down the booze. Tastes a bit like spearmint gum after chewing a while"

2.0,"Nose - Sharp sweet minty vanilla, cherry/berry cough drops, grapefruit pith, faint butterscotch sweetness in the background

Taste - Sharp sweet vanilla/mint/herbal simple syrup, ginger/cinnamon spice, sweet orange/grapefruit zest.

Finish - Very sweet herbal simple, very artificially sweet, like splenda, lingering cinnamon/ginger tingle, bitter grapefuit zest mingles with some ginger spice.

Score - 69/100

Final Thoughts - Looking back on my review of the 2 year, I think I probably scored it at least 10 points too high. After sitting down with this, I found that although it's quite unique, it has this way too sweet that turns into an artificial sweet, mixed with this artificial sweet mint vibe. It's interesting for sure, but the more it sits on the tongue and you let it stand, the more weird and slightly off putting it gets. Not sure if I got a bad batch or something, but this was way more splenda-like than I remembered. I'll have to see how this holds up in a Sazerac cocktail as I think the weird sweetness in it might complement the absinthe rinse quite well.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

5.0,"I got this from a Kroger earlier this year for $38. I recently got the 4 year rye (on the right), but thought I’d review this before cracking that one open. 

Setting: in glass, rested 10 minutes

Nose: slight caramel, ethanol (54%), oak and spice, mint and slight dill, there’s also a sweet note that I can’t quite name, butterscotch perhaps?

Palate: rye spice, slight caramel and vanillin, oak, some menthol and dill finally some grain at the end. There’s a medium finish, but oh so good. 

I have say, I really enjoy this rye. There are only 2 other ryes I can think of off the top of my head that I enjoyed more, but no disrespect to Willett, in my opinion this young rye is GREAT.

4.0,"53.7% abv

Nose: rye spice of course; dill; vanilla; slight brine.

Taste: full sweet and creamy, with butterscotch, caramel and vanilla at first, giving way to a full hit of rye spice; as it develops it dries, with assorts spices like dill, Serrano pepper and black pepper.

Finish: medium-long and drying, with slight toffee and peanut brittle rounding out an intense rye spiciness which leaves your tongue tingling. Peppermint and spearmint finish the deal.

Value: $45-$60 USD (if you can find it). It’s worth it. 

Final thoughts: while tough to get your hands on, this cask strength rye checks all the boxes of a stellar mid-shelf whiskey. Great neat and with a drop of water, I could also see this standing up well in a cocktail. If the dill note doesn’t turn you off, this complex rye is a must buy. 

Score: 4/5

Highly recommend buying a bottle"
