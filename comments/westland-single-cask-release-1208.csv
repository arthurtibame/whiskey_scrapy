Taste Notes 

Nose: 
Bright fruit I get roasted Banana, cigar box peat, nutty, saison funk, savory steak and floral wild flowers.

Front: 
like the nose a cigar box smokiness, malty nutty sweetness, grilled bananas , funky floral that lingers 

Back:
This just goes for days it’s peaty turns to a smooth sweet cigar like is the tail end of smoky sweetness. This is Westland American Oak and Peat Week blended together. Amazing unicorn 🦄 that I will sipping this one slowly. 

Happy Saturday everyone Cheers!"
