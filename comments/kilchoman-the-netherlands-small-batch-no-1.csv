2.75,"My one pour of the week...had this last night while watching The Hunt.  

Sometimes things aren’t what they seem.  Like back in grad school, I casually dated this one woman, we’ll call her B.  B was a free spirit.  Did what she wanted, said what was on her mind, and loved the casual part in the relationship rather than taking things a step more ( which, for a young grad student, was perfect).  But, she kept saying how she’s in a Triad, with “D” and “ S”, and if I minded it at all.  I never understood how someone so peace loving and borderline tree hugging can possibly belong in a vicious Chinese Triad mafia.  Besides, she wasn’t Asian.  I don’t know, maybe the Chinese mafia loosened their recruiting parameters.  But I never asked details...she was gorgeous, and I just thanked my lucky situation.   But after a few weeks,  she kept insisting I should meet D” and “S”.  I kept saying no...I really had no intentions of meeting mafia.  One day, she surprised me.  We were out at a restaurant.  She said “ I invited the Triad over...I know you don’t want to meet them, but they’re a part of me, and I need you to accept them”.  I was terrified.  I figured I’d be sliced up with swords and nunchucks.  “D” and “S” walk into the restaurant.  Wait...they’re not Asian either.  In fact, “D” seems as if he’s really over-weight...they must’ve REALLY loosened up Triad recruiting practices.  Half way through dinner, not a single conversation on mafia things...I figured out Triad can also mean 3 people in a polyamory relationship....and I was being asked to be the fourth.  

And that my friends, leads me to this pour...it’s not really your typical Kilchoman.  I expect Kilchoman to be more complex, pettier, layered with fruits and smoke.  This...this was flat.  Got the peat on the nose, but the palette was tepid.  My 2nd Kilchoman ever I didn’t like ( only other being the Port one).  

Moral of the story:  don’t go in assuming—--might not turn out what you originally think."
2.75,"Nose: a delicious mild but present peat with fresh and savory citrus note along with other mixed fruits. The nose doesn’t have much variety but it is really enjoyable with what it has to offer. Simple, approachable, delicate, fruity and sweet. Really great. 

Palate: not what I expected with that charming nose. It is really harsh and dry. Next to the smokey peat there isn’t much from the fruitiness left. I get a interesting pine needle taste (obviously in a combination with the nose) and it is kinda sweet. The finish is long and pleasant again and presents itself with ripe peaches.

The nose is really nice and with water release some vanilla as well. I would rate the nose 3,75. The palate though isn’t very great. The peat and smokiness is nice but that’s about it what is noticeably interesting to me. Not bad - just not great. That would be a 2,0.

That leaves me with a 2,75. While I wouldn‘t buy a whole bottle of this I would gladly taste other Kilchoman expressions. I think it can be nice with some more years in nice finishing-casks. Anyone any recommendations from this distillery?"
