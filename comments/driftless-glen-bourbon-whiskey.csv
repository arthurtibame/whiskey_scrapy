4.5,"Very smooth. No bite til 20-30 seconds after, even then minimal. With the ingredients being different than normal had a different after taste. Unique but thoroughly enjoyable."
3.75,Love their place in Baraboo

1.5,Meh.  Definitely needs water.  Tough after taste.  Lots of caramel.
4.0,Got this at the PX in Ft Knox. Felt like I was committing a sin purchasing this in actual bourbon country. Sweet and smooth.
