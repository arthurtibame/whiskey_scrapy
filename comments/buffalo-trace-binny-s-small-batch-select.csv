4.25,May have been one of my favorite store picks of 2019.  Tastes like a Heath Bar.  If this were higher proof and had a bit more viscosity it would go from good to great!  Figure in the price and I am kicking myself for not getting a case!

1.0,Very harsh and spicy. Not near dark enough for my taste. I would buy this again.
