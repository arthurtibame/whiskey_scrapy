4.0,I found the glenfiddich 12 and 18 very much one dimensional but this was certainly a few notches up similar to the medeira cask. Rich and elegant

4.0,"While I'm not a huge fan of Glenfiddich (I find them too sweet) this is none the less a nice whiskey.
The price however is quite prohibitive, there are a lot of whiskey, in my opinion, that are much better, at a fifth of the price of this one."

4.0,"No. 8 on my Glenfiddich journey. Great whiskey, one of those ones you just want to roll round and round your mouth. Vanilla, honey in spades. Now this is a ridiculously expensive whisky at $350USD. I really should take it down to 3 based on price but its better than that. Great way to finish off the tasting."

4.25,"Woody, complex, finally a glenfiddich with age statement that tastes like a real scotch and 43abv. But for the price, this one is not really worth it.
