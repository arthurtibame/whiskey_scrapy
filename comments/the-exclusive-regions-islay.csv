4.25,"Liqour Express is a local store in the Phoenix, AZ valley that does an outstanding job in picking their exclusive store picks. I have had several from them (WhistlePig, Four Roses, Elijah Craig, 1792 BiB to name a few) and was excited to here they recently got a Ledaig 10 yr Cask Strength single cask store pick. So I made a point of stopping by to sample it (what's great is that they pour samples of their picks in store). After having a sample of it , I quite enjoyed it but not enough to part with $100. They then proceed to pour me another 4/5 samples and I settle on a Knob Creek Rye SiB pick (it was extremely tasty, seek those out of you like rye). Before I check out I ask if he has anything unique and good. He pulls this bottle out and proceeds to tell me it's the very last one and has a customer who buys it by the case. I am really getting into my Peated scotches and decided to just go for it. Especially after they told me they had a couple cases left of the Knob Rye. Let's dive into the specifics of this bottle (per the IB information provided to the store):

1) This was distilled and aged by Bunnahabhain
2) It's age stated at 9 years old
3) It's a heavily Peated Single Malt
4) It's exclusively aged in a first fill ex Bourbon barrel
5) It's bottled at 50% abv
6) It's non chill filtered and natural color

Let's now dive into the tasting:

Upon entry younger smacked in the face with a big peat note, however, it quickly recedes to reveal honey and grilled fruits. Mid palette adds a wonderful toffee and butterscotch note layered in with the peat. The finish is long with brine, vanilla, oak and barrel spice. The smoke then returns with sea air. It's a really lovely dram. As the finish and smoke linger it turns slightly bitter and astringent which is really the only drawback. That is where the youth reveals itself. 
That said with the price paid for this one it's a great dram. It's a brash, young Islay that has some lovely complexity with it sweet and salty notes. 
Great cask Selection by this IB. I am sad that this was the last bottle as I would have liked a back up or two! 
Cheers all!"
