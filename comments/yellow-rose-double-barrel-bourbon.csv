2.0,Not a fan of texas bourbons.  Have strong corn flavor and just doesn't taste like bourbon.  Almost nauseating smell to it.  At least it doesn't taste like shoe leather like other Texas bourbon I tried
3.5,"Not bad. This has a more well-rounded flavor than their regular bourbon. There’s some fruit notes along with the dusty corn. It’s really young but less astringent. Maybe due to the older age. However, you pay a premium for this whiskey that tastes closer to other whiskeys that are cheaper and older from Kentucky. Expensive for $70."

2.0,Not my idea of sipping whiskey.  Too pricey to mix with Coke and it just ruins the Coke. Wouldn't buy it again
