3.75,"The second sample from my Bimber set is labeled as a test batch from a recharred cask bottled at 51.9%, so it may not be identical to the retail bottle but should be close enough to review here. The nose is malty with a hint of lemon, pine, salt and sweet orange oil. It’s crisp and malty in the mouth with a silky, oily texture and more of those sweet orange notes. The finish is long and toasty, although there’s a hint of a rough youthful spirit beneath the surface. Excellent for the age, especially when compared against the American craft distilleries."
4.0,"In the glass it has a deep caramel color with intense copper shades.
The important alcohol content is not at all intrusive to the nose, which is wrapped in an embrace of ripe fruit, raisins, prunes, vanilla and a light hint of wood. There is also a pinch of spices and almond. Persuasive.
Oily and soft on the palate, the first sip is really enveloping and warm, with a sweet profile with a background of cinnamon that makes it almost Christmas: dehydrated apricots and peaches, vanilla, a little pepper, almonds. All well blended and balanced, someone would say drinkable but in a good way: to be young (4 years, I suppose) it has much more structure than other older whiskeys.
The finish is not very long, with ripe fruit, cinnamon and vanilla."
