4.5,"An awesome and unique whiskey. 
Nose - rye spice and honey in equal measures, with some vanilla and caramel coming though as well
Taste - spiced honey, not at all cloying, with some floral and herbal notes, really well balanced
Finish - lingering and sweet with a delightful burn and a bit more spice at the end"
