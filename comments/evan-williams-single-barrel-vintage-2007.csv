4.0,"-2007 stamp @ 27$

Single barrel EW has a rich nose and hearty profile on the palate. Finish is moderate heat with some spicey after taste. Standard vaniallas and caramels and oak in abundance give it a good traditional bourbon character. This comes as no surprise considering it's heritage and pedigree. Finding such a bourbon below the 25$ price point is ALWAYS a good thing and EWSB is no exception. The 2007 seems to have developed something of a rep so if you can find that one all the better. You could easily pay twice as much to get a bourbon of this calibre, but why would you?

The 2007 has a great bold flavor:

Nose: Sour candy apple small oak and assorted citrus.

On the palate you get the citrus mango orange and lemon peel and then loads of the sour apple., this is the sweet green jolly rancher sour apple that almost says ""Im an apple flavoured bourbon"" yet it is clearly just a ester fruit flavor coming through. There is nothing flavored here, just a fantastic bourbon that stands out as unique.
Finish is smooth with little heat and more of that great jolly rancher sour apple."
