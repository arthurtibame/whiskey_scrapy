4.0,Really surprised to see the low Distiller rating on this. Smooth and flowery and enjoyed every sip. Better than most

3.0,Good story behind it. Not bad bourbon. A bit on the sweeter side. Enjoyed after chorizo tacos

4.0,"Amber coloring and extremely sweet smell. Tastes very sweet at first and has a nice, intensely spicy finish. Pleasant and smooth."

4.0,Nice fruity nose which continues on first sip. Incredibly easy sipper  as it's dangerously smooth with no burn which could be good or bad but still a lot of life in this blend. Overall a top shelf bourbon for me  will need to grab next time I see as I don't come across it often

3.0,"Banana bread on the nose? Actually, yes - I totally get it! Sweet and almost floral on the pallete with hints of cinnamon and spice. Smooth and mild on the finish. Quite nice overall."

2.0,This bourbon tastes like a mix of Woodford Distiller Select and Double Barrelled.  You get the spice of a younger bourbon coupled with the toasted barrel characters like bananas foster.  I thought the good flavors dissipated quickly and the finish had quite a bit of burn.

3.0,"Given that they're contractually forbidden from saying anything, most of the fun here is in trying to place the source of this juice. My own personal guess is ""all over the place,"" as I get flavours I associate with Barton, Old Forester, Beam, and Heaven Hill. The whiskey itself is decent, but low ABV and unremarkable for the asking price. Flavours are custard, banana, light charred corn, vague vegetable mustiness, light rye, orange peel, cherry coke, mint, and clove. Taste is alternating sweet and dry, tending after the sip toward an interesting herbal, dry, menthol/eucalyptus quality."

Actually not too different from Nikka Coffey Malt, which is exceptional. Try this if you can find it."
