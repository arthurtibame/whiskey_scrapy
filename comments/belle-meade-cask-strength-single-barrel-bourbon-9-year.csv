5.0,"Absolutely fantastic; by far, one of my most favorite single barrels. My particular bottle weighs in at 121.4 proof, but goes down extremely smooth. Nice velvety mouth feel, with wonderful flavors of chewy caramel, vanilla bean, and milk chocolate. Nice rewarding finish, too. Nelson's Green Briar continues to deliver."
3.0,Heavy oak and caramel. The flavors come out with an ice cube. Some burn but not too much. This bottle is 107.7 proof.

5.0,"This bourbon is a little harsh if you drink it neat, but adding a few drops of water REALLY opens it up, and it is absolutely delicious. Lots of sweet notes, and very buttery. The heat from the proof hits the roof of your mouth, instead of your throat as you drink it. It costs about $50-60, and is worth it. #318, bottle 106, 105.5 proof."

4.0,"#1384 ABV 57.2 Barreled 4/27/06
Nose red berries, oak, citrus spice
Taste of Fried sugared plantains, almonds, mature molasses. FULL BOLD & COMPLEX. The cherries and orange hangs underneath.
Finish long with rye bite. Full boat if you taste it neat at room temp.
Usually not a fan of sourced juice but this drink is excellent. $65 at my Memphis shop. Would overspend again! Must for SB cast strength fans."

5.0,"I will be the first to admit that I seldom cotton to bourbon as much as I do to scotch or Irish. Bourbon feels predictable and (too often) heavy handed. This is not one of those. I've never really tasted a whiskey of any sort quite like this before. The nose only offers a partial glimpse into the complex palate, but the deep, rich vanilla, caramel, and earthy woody funk is awfully appealing. The palate is at once sweet (vanilla and clover honey), woody, spicy, herbal (almost medicinal), and earthy, with a lingering rye spice and bitter herb note. If all bourbon brought this much to the table, I would probably drink a lot more of it."

5.0,"Bright reddish brown color. Rich chocolate and sweet leather nose. Some real nice complexity on the nose. Taste of dried fruit initially, then sour cherries. Once again, I feel like I'm dealing with a very complex whiskey that will get more interesting over time. This is definitely wonderful. I sampled batch 2D bottle 298."

4.0,"Reviewed at twisted spoke chicago

Orange nutmeg on the nose with some allspice a little cherry

Palate is mulled wine very warm but not over alcohol. A little toffee and caramel with some chocolate upon further sips

Finish has a little burn  with some grassiness 

A really plus bourbon I will have to get a bottle for the collection"

5.0,"Run, don’t walk to your closest spirits store and snag a bottle.  This pour has all of the good qualities of a bourbon without any drawbacks.  It’s sweet, has gentle burn for being 100+ Proof, and has a wonderful (vanilla frosting?) finish that goes on forever.  This stuff is way better than many bourbons that command higher prices on the secondary market and is a steal at $70. I had Barrel 3136 - 10 years old - 104.5 Proof."
