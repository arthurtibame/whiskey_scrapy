2.5,"This is a rough spirit to drink. It says it is a white whiskey (unaged) and yes it is. Now I have very little experience with unaged whiskey but I do like gins, vodkas, and white rum so I took a chance with this. First, on the nose, it is sweet corn and ethanol. There is almost no middle body and the finish is also sweet with a touch of bitterness at the very end. While I did not like it at first it did grow on me over the weeks that I tried it. I have made whiskey and cokes out of it and it is just fine for that I just do not see me getting a new bottle when this one is gone. Sorry Popcorn I am not a fan of this."
3.5,"Got it on clearance.  Nice body and very smooth with buttery sweet corn being the main flavor.  In the four bottles on the shelf in the store, there were floaters that had settled to the bottom of each which were easily disturbed when moving the bottles.   At home, I shook up the bottle I bought and the floaters seemed to break apart into much smaller particles.  I guess they could have resulted from minimal filtering and/or hard water added for proofing."
3.75,"Initially, hints of butter and oats, followed by a woodsy finish. A very good shine, though perhaps not as complex as I would have figured."
