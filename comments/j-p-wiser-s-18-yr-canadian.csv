4.75,"Very nice whisky. The nose is reach as well as the taste. Finish pretty long. Rather sweet, with vanilla, honey, rum, oak, marzipan, not overwhelmed with alcohol. Interesting blend."
4.0,"Surprisingly complex and smooth..
Caramel and sweetness like honey or candied fruit. This was an unanticipated delight... I will buy this one again, or perhaps take a swing at the 35 yr old ..."

4.0,"Fairly complex, lightly sweet but subtle wood flavorings.  Bit of vanilla that lingers but the finish is typical to Canadian- bit of zest but remains clean on the palette.  Solid for the price."
