4.5,"I am sorry. Truly sorry. I am sorry for waiting 581 whiskies to finally taste a Tamdhu. And i went full mainstream, with this 12yo expression, matured in ex-sherry casks, and i got to say i was mind blown. A very simplistic looking bottle, this is just a great 12yo whisky. 

Bottled at 43%abv, golden color.

On the nose: perfection. Coffee; Dark dry cake (christmas /wedding cake); Figs, Prunes and Blackberries. Aniseed. Fondant /butter / cream. Beautiful sherriness, you can tell the barrels where exceptional. Impalpable sugar. Sweet fruit syrup. Awesome sweet nose. 

On the palate it is a little straightforward, but very pleasant. Immidiately you get the spiciness. Some pleasant alcohol note and oak spice. Very Woody (i dont ever use the ""oak"" and ""wood"" notes to describe a whisky, but this one is exactly that.  Almondy, nutty.

Not sweet. Rather woody and bitter.
Toffee and honey on the third sip. It's more like caramel than honey. Buttery, butterscotch.

Aftertaste is.... peaty???

Tobacco leaf. Hints of smoke. Very Dry.
Hay and dry grasses. Very Rewarding.
Long lasting peppery finish. Cigarrete notes. 

So, this is a great offer. It is sweet on the nose, then spicy on the palate, to finish grassy and peaty. Very complex, but rounded. Amazing dram. My score system says 90 over 100, but i believe it really deserves 91-92. I will buy this again...

And again, and again..."

3.0,Nice and pleasant sherry cask aged single malt - not to complex and with a juvenile burn. Delivers exactly what you expect from a sherry cask matured dram - nothing surprising or unexpected. But it gets quiet a bid better the longer you enjoy a glass.
