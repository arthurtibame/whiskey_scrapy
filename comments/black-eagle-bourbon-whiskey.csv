1.0,"First, let’s get one thing straight, this was clearly a giggles purchase. Or more like the aftermath of a whisk(e)y aficionado losing a bet. 

Needless to say, I was very amused by a bottle of bourbon that had nothing better to say about itself on the label than “individual barreled”. How bad could something worse than the bottom of the barrel be? Black Eagle is labeled “bourbon whiskey” so I’m assuming it meets those most basic requirements. Aged 3 years, bottled at 40% ABV*, and produced in Minnesota. 

Packaging: The bottle is so cheap I had to cut the bottom of the screw top off. It’s like the whisk(e)y gods are begging for me to spare myself. Keeping an open mind is going to be more difficult than opening this bottle. 

Appearance: I gotta be honest, the first thing that popped into my head was dehydrated urine. I hope that’s not what’s in here. Also, a quick Google search of “black eagle” informs me that a black eagle is in fact a real species of bird native to Southeast Asia. I’m not sure how it relates to a bottle of bourbon from Minnesota. 

Nose: What nose? It’s all ethanol. Ok, grainy, fruity ethanol.  At least it’s not laboratory-grade ethanol.  I don’t know if I’ve ever smelled something more non-descript. Dewar’s and JW Red have more going on. 

Palate: Did I just drink recycled heads and tails? Probably. That is sweet, grainy, and harsh, with a bit of charred, metallic vegetal funk. 

Finish: Whiskey flavored mouthwash. Now with added char and bitterness for dental health. 

Ok guys. Steer clear. The only thing I can assure you of is that they promised they aged this in some sort of individual barrel instead of a gasoline tanker truck. And that this is why I’m not a betting woman. 

There must be better whiskey produced somewhere in the state of Minnesota.

*Is it a joke that Distiller says this is 10% ABV? That’s probably appropriate because that is the ratio of mixer you’d need to make this remotely palatable."
