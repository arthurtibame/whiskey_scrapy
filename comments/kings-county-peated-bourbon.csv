4.0,"it has some soft sweetness on the nose. there's a depth to it I can not place. maybe light peat and fresh leather. after a sip, I get sweetness. Fruits. The lightest of spice. Has some nice, unique complexity. Let it sit on you for a bit and you'll get a dash of peat. Overall, a very delicious offering. If they offered 750s at $50, it'd be on my bar consistently. At 42 for a 300mL, I'll keep this as a 'save for special occasions' dram. Worth having around!"

3.75,"Nose - Smokey with dried grass, oak, leather, cigar smoke, vanilla, muscovado sugar and straw. 

Palate - Gentle smoke with vanilla, barley sugar, slight hint of caramel and mint, and buttered popcorn. 

Finish - Medium length with fading pepper, vanilla, molasses and cinnamon."
3.5,"This one is an upgrade of the standard offering. Smoke is subtle and in the background, however, you do taste it. Otherwise the notes are similar to the Bourbon. Vanilla, brown sugar and pepper. Nice pour. A much tamer Campfire!"

2.5,Tasted nice by itself. After other tastings the earth flavor became very noticeable. Tasted spicy and a bit woody. The finish was spicy with a prominent earthy flavor.

3.0,"Confusing. Like, do your run from the velociraptor or stay and fight? 

If you fight, it's like getting this good whiff of maple in your nose.
If you run, you get clawed down by a lingering uncomplex iodine taste.

Whatever your path, give it your all."
4.5,"A very interesting release from King's County. The nose is very misleading; pure maple with a little honey. The taste, however, is quite remarkable. Rather aggressive upfront, it gives way to a beautiful blend of peat and maple, with hints of vanilla. Neither the peat nor the maple overpower your tongue. The finish is nice and long, a fresh apple pie, smoked by maple wood. A good introduction into the world of peat, but also easily enjoyed by fans of peat."
3.5,"Smoky, sweet barbecue. Clove, nutmeg, anise. Spicy and youthful but the added complexity of the peated barley gives this expression an edge over the flagship.

EDIT:
Lovely prunes, winter spices, and smoke on a more favorable second tasting. (3.25 -> 3.5 stars)"
