2.5,I’ve also tried there the Californian Wine Cask. Not so pleasant and complex as the Oloroso. Doesn’t worth in my opinion
3.75,"I’m quite puzzled about this review. What I tried there was. A 11 yo First Fill Oloroso Cask. Dram was outstanding, with a walnut and fig note that drive me crazy. What it strange for me is how is it possible to reach this result in 11 years. Never find anything similar tasting their competitors."

4.5,"Distillery only bottlings can be a bit of a hit-and-miss affair. However, this 2005 Auchentoshan (aged for 12 years in PX cask 135, bottled at 59.8% ABV) is a real belter of a Single Malt! Maple syrup, raspberries and candy floss bewitch the nose, and there are notes of raisins, creamy toffee and freshly cut flowers. Strong, intense and sweet in the arrival, the palate is greeted by fresh herbs, peppermint and dark chocolate before wood spices and hints of berry sweetness march off into the distance. All in all, a fantastic whisky with a great presentation!

4.25,"This was a lovely dram that one friend shared me a glass of it, you can only get it in the Auchentoshan distillery. They even bottle it in your presence. 

This is a 54.2%abv cask strength, bordeaux cask, distilled on 25.09.2008 and bottled on 14.02.2018; beautiful chesnut color. 

On the nose is quite appealing. I am not a fond fan of Auchentoshan, i find it to be a little too ""irish"" in its style, but this is definitively my favorite one. Coffee, Chocolate, Lemon, Merthiolate, Super powerful aroma, Lavender, Oranges, Milk chocolate, Floral. Everything is going on here. 

On the palate is also very nice, like Lemonade with spices. Pepper bomb, Malt, Chocolate, milk powder.

A very short clove finish, cost it some points on my chart. Nicely balanced. 

Overall this is a nice dram, i dont think its very accesible, but it is my first bordeaux cask, so if you ever get an auchentoshan matured in a bordeaux cask, it should be like this one. 87 /100. Nice."
