3.0,"Would give it 3.5 stars if I could.
  
  On the nose it presents as though it were aged in ex-bourbon barrels, or at the least American oak (despite it apparently being 100% sherry cask aged).  First taste impressions reminded me of a Glenfiddich 15 or a Glenmorangie Original; smooth, almost to the point of being too balanced.  Second taste the next day the bite popped more than I remembered, and much more than I would have expected for a 46%.
  
  Would likely buy again, but wouldn't go out of my way to do it.  For a sherry cask finish, I'm looking for something a little more fruity/Christmas Cake-y."

3.0,"On the nose, a true Speysider. Beeswax, red fruit, slightly winelike. On the palate it reminds me of an Irish. There's more fruit, and some citrus comes along bringing lemon tart to mind. However, it's a bit thin. A good everyday drinker but not at that price point ($60). From tasting event, 12/17/16."

Smells like Speyside. Malty sweetness, vanilla, light brown sugar, some hay. Palate brings honey sweetness, dried trail mix fruit flavors, some nuttiness, and more brown sugar. The finish is medium length and peppery, with a slight hint of bitterness. 

Dry glass smells of dried fruits. 

Nice, and a solid dram despite its youth. 85 points and a solid 4 stars."

3.0,"Trying to decide about this whisky. There is definitely nothing offensive or overpowering. The nose is good, with sherry present, and, with time, chocolate. The palate is creamy and sweet, but a bit weak. The finish is medium long, with oak and some sherry. It finishes dry and with a touch of bitterness. For the price it is good. If I had to pick a word to describe it, I would pick that terrible word that says everything and nothing at the same time. This is a nice whisky."

Medium candy sweetness on the palate, something like dried apricot, leaving a mild cinnamon peppery taste behind. Classic, clean Speyside. Would prefer a bit more intensity, but it's also not overly sweet, thankfully."

3.0,"Finished the Thanksgiving Turkey dinner.  I poured this whisky sample to aid in the digestion of said turkey.

Pour it and let it settle (like the turkey dinner) and the nose is greeted with a floral aromas with honey, vanilla and heather.  Sprinkle in some ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon.  The more it opens, the fruitier notes of dried apricots and dates come through.  If you are familiar with The Famous Grouse, you can detect it's parent roots.

Take a sip and the palate takes on a soft and thick liquid that arrives with lemon citrus and sweet notes of milk chocolate and vanilla.  Pepper, cinnamon and oak provide the spicy, vibrant zing on the tongue and that spiciness delivers to the finish.

The finish is long and lasting.  Plumb fruitiness packed with black pepper and cinnamon zing and lemon zest.  At the final fade, bitter sweet chocolate comes through. 

This was actually and unexpectedly made for a perfect after dinner dram.  Especially after an autumn Thanksgiving meal.  A nice dessert scotch.  The counterplay of sweet and spice keeps the palate active and probing.  [86/100][Tasted: 11/23/17]"

brown sugar molasses, maple (but not too syrupy), a bit better than Bunnahabhain."
4.0,"I can do ..the Tamdhu! Wow, this is a 10 year old? I think someone's pulling a fast one here. This is like ZZ Top's ""Legs"".. It knows how to use them. People seem to compare this to the Macallan 12, but I think this is more of a Glendronach type. The nose is faint to me, but has really nice spice, ginger, honey, mmm sherry everywhere. Palate is a pop of cinnamon sticks without being sweet. Peaches..no.. nectarines, with faint raisins, red grapes, peppermint, and vanilla. Finish is short to medium with caramel corn and toffee. I won't spoil my upcoming Batch 2 review from my earlier expo experience, but this distillery gets better and better. Count me in for more drams please! Thanks for the sample Ryan."

2.0,"One more sample as part of our trading team--courtesy of Ryan.   Here's a bit of a dilemma.  I couldn't stand the aroma of this, was almost like fermented vegetables, like cabbage.   But the palette then turns into a mix of chocolate and orchard fruits, with a hefty dose of hazelnuts.  I I loved the palette and finish, but I couldn't get past the aroma.  Maybe I let it stand out too long?  Not sure.  Obviously something I did, since seems like no other reviewer mentioned fermented cabbage as an aroma.  ( tainted Glencairn?  Tainted water? Who knows)"

4.0,"Stop number 34 on the SDT is Tamdhu. Tamdhu was previously owned by the parent company that owns Macallan and Highland Park but was sold to Ian Macleod Distillers because it just wasn't popular enough to maintain. This 10 year old is matured exclusively in sherry casks, and most or all are first fill. Bottled at 43% ABV and i believe it is chill filtered and has colorant added (although I think it's a minimal amount used to even out variations in batch color) making it a dark copper. Get comfortable, because this is going to be a long one. 

The nose is a full on sherry bomb. Sherried fruits, dates, raisins and figs. Plenty of vanilla and a warm nuttiness like almonds coated in brown sugar. This has a nose similar to the Macallan 12 year double cask, but warmer and it feels like it has a higher proportion of American oak to European oak. Some lighter fruits as well, chocolate oranges perhaps. Soft but elegant oak, rich dark chocolate salted caramels. There was a low level alcohol burn at first but it faded pretty fast. A little dry grass and anise/licorice root. More chocolate notes, with toffee, like a Heath bar. Really a beautiful nose. Rich buttery popcorn or warm buttercream. Man this thing just keeps evolving. Light cinnamon and mint. Ginger and herbal tea, maple syrup and the barest thread of wood smoke. Truly a superb nose. 

After that kind of an experience with the nose I was worried that the palate would let me down. So happy to be wrong. Rich and sweet up front. Buttery with a little spice. Ripe red fruits and sherry wine notes. Salted caramels and semi sweet chocolate. Gentle oak, just enough to let you know it's there. A touch of vegetal earthiness and peat. Earthy, mainland forest peat, not Islay peat. Just a hint of it though, nothing crazy. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel. Luxuriously oily and mouthwatering. 
The finish, unfortunately falls a bit short. Medium length and very dry. Sherry, dark berries and a little mint. About half way through it becomes a little bitter. 

This is a fantastic single malt. I was not expecting this level of quality. The use of first fill casks is apparent as the flavors are so full and prominent. This is a 10 year old, but I suspect there are far older casks at work here. This is so good, probably the best Speysider in it's price range that I've ever had. I would love to see this same whisky in an 18 year old release. Whiskies like this one really push me to the sherry matured side vs the bourbon matured side. When done right, like it is here, it's a thing of beauty. The finish could have been better, but it is an all around winner. This sample was provided by Lee and he bought the bottle for $80. While I would indeed pay this amount, it is available here in Michigan for $65, making it a no brainer. A solid 4.5, pretty respectable for a little 10 year old from a relatively unknown distillery. 
Cheers"
3.0,"It's time for another sample from the third round of our Scottish whisky trading team.  This is the Tamdhu 10 year that was supplied by Ryan (via Me).  I purchased this bottle here off the shelves in Virginia for around $80.  I believe that price is on the higher side, but it was a spontaneous purchase while shopping locally.

This Speysider was previously considered a major player in Cutty Sark and Famous Grouse blends until recently when it was turned into a distillery released, single malt.  The U.S. export bottles are 43% ABV, instead of the U.K. standard 40%.  That is a welcome difference, IMO.  It's a beautiful, new penny copper in color and produces thicker, yet more watery legs in the taster.

The nose opens with typical sherry notes, stewed berries and candied almonds.  There's a faint bit of cedar rounding things out.  It's slightly Macallan-esque on the nose and palate.  That's good company to be in, if I might add.

The palate starts with a thin layer of caramel, chocolate and normal sherry notes before fading into cinnamon and oak spiciness.  I think this is the kick from the slightly higher ABV.  It turns this from a straight dessert dram into a solid, sipping whisky.

The finish is shorter than I'd like, spicy and drying as the overall oak flavors wash everything away.  I did notice a wonderful chocolate flavor settle in after a few minutes.  I found the finish more fulfilling as time passed.

Overall, this is a quality dram.  It seems good at slightly imitating Macallan 12, while being 2 years younger.  The problem is that at $80 it's above Macallan's local price point.  If this were $25 cheaper it would be a no-brainer as a quality replacement for Mac12.  As is, it's a solid whisky and still pretty enjoyable.  3.5 stars because it isn't priced appropriately, IMO.  Cheers."

3.0,"Not a bad whisky, but also not my first choice. Probably not my 200th either. In fact, I'm not sure if the sherry casks were meant to enhance this whisky or mask a mediocre base spirit. The predominant note is of old tobacco, the kind you keep smoking when you should rather be cleaning out of your pipe. There are also notes of almonds and vanilla bean, with a touch figs. It all sounds wonderful, and it actually isn't bad, but I'm going to give credit to the barrels that were used rather than the whisky itself. Slainte!"

2.0,"Nose: Distant sherry, raisins and cereal.

Palate: A light malty arrival that moves on to a sherry, dried fruit, citrus and brown sugar development with a little spice. It’s very laid back and on the whole I felt that the palate lacked presence.

Finish: Short. The spice note in the palate trails off, quickly.

I'm at a loss to understand the generally high ratings I see for this whisky, here and on other sites. For my taste it’s much too thin and nondescript and I could not find any of the aromas or flavours described in the official tasting notes.

In fact, I was so puzzled I poured a dram of Highland Park 12 to taste just to check that my sense of taste was not haywire today. No, the HP was just as usual.

I don't know if I should rate this at all - perhaps I have a bad bottle? I can't believe that it is meant to be so feeble and distant. It’s not actively unpleasant or bad so I’m giving it 2 stars on that basis.

“Acceptable"" : 2 stars"

4.0,"I got this bottle through a mistake. I had ordered the Batch strength after hearing such great things about it, but received this instead. After getting a refund for the difference in the price as well as a $15 credit to my account for my trouble, I decided to give it a go. That was at Christmas and I’m still trying to decide what to make of this whisky. This review is based on several tastings over the last couple of weeks. 

In the glass it’s a beautiful copper color. It clings to the glass with a thick oily coating that develops very slow legs. It’s bottled at 43% ABV. My first impression on opening the bottle was not good. There was a significant alcohol burn  and the most noticeable scent to me was something I can only describe as “stinky peat”. A strong earthy, wet, organic odor. I thought “what the hell have I got into here?” After some time in the glass the alcohol faded and I could pick out some dark fruits, but that was it. Fortunately, two weeks after opening the nose has improved immensely. The “stinky peat” has faded to an earthy tone revealing raisins, plums, and cherries. Sweetness like burnt sugar. Dark chocolate and orange peel. A light smoke and rum soaked fruitcake. Much better than the initial impression. 

The palate did not evolve as much over time as the nose did. At first it seemed a little hot, but that has calmed down. There is brown sugar sweetness, light smoke, and a floral peat tone. Some chocolate and sherry and red fruits. Water seems to help bring out the fruity/sherry notes for me. 

The finish is fairly long, with more brown sugar and dark honey. Water improves the finish as well, adding a malty cereal note that lingers quite a while. 

Overall this is a pretty good whisky that greatly benefitted, for me at least, from some time in the bottle. It can be found online for about $65 which makes it an average value in my opinion. 4.25/5.0. Cheers!"

3.0,"I had a sherry blind tasting with 8 different sherried whiskies.

Tamdhu 10 finished last.  It was not a close last.  There were 7 decadent, rich sherried whiskies oozing dark fruits, dark chocolate, butterscotch, and crème brulee.  And 1 beer.  This was the beer.

The nose is dominated by the spirit.  Young malt and organic solvent.  Light fruits and nutty popcorn, almonds, and sherry, but not enough sherry.  A nutty, malty, citrusy arrival that only later becomes dark fruits.  Orange peels, white pepper, and a light smoke towards the finish.  The finish is the only redeeming part.  The nose and palate expose that the Tamdhu new make is nowhere near the Macallan caliber they are trying to emulate, and this product is too young, and needs more barrel influence to smooth out its flaws.

I bet the batch strength Tamdhu, which is officially NAS, is 11-12 years.  I really enjoyed batch #1, and not as much batch #2.  Now that I’ve tried Tamdhu 10, I am noticing some bad characteristics in the batch #1 hidden by the stronger ABV and, I think, more time in the barrel.  So, not only is this bottle not worth the premium price they are charging for a 10 year old, it made another bottle (batch 1) not worth it by bringing attention to Tamdhu’s flaws.  I’m definitely done playing with this distillery.  Macallan from the future it is not.

PRESUMPTIVE MARK: 77/100

This time it's different I really enjoyed this.  Now it's not as complex as the Macallan whiskey makers edition. But it does what it has well and has none of the MWME bitterness on the aftertaste.
