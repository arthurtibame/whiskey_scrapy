2.0,"Received a sample of this as part of a gift set.  This is definitely not one I will be seeking out. It's fairly one dimensional.  

On the nose, it begins a little sweet, with sugary aromas and some indistinguishable tart fruit (maybe sour apple juice) followed quickly by smoke, but not so much in the campfire category unless we're talking about a fire whose embers have long since gone cold. More ash than smoke. 

On the palate, sweetness hits the front of the tongue, followed by that ashy quality on the mid palate. It reminds me of how my dad's pipe used to smell when he was cleaning it. Despite the relatively low ABV, the finish is pretty hot and peppery, perhaps belying its youthfulness.   The finish continues with more-you guessed it-ash.  

Only much later, after breathing out through my nose, do I get a sense of brininess and iodine. 

This was not a pleasant dram for me. Far too much in the spent ash realm for my taste. Perhaps more time in the barrel for this NAS would add some dimension and complexity, and tame the ashiness and heat."
