4.0,Last time I drank this it was almost perfect but this time it seems to have a stronger alcohol taste taking away from the usual smooth burnt honey flavour. Smells nicer when the glass is empty. Will try it again.

4.5,Exceptional. Smooth yet peaty. Approachable but earthy and salty. Wife doesn’t want to be near me when I drink it. Perfect. All jokes aside I think this is the best Islay scotch you can buy for the money. Drank it by the bonfire and had an aged Padron 3000 to go with it. Did not want this dram or the Padron to end!

orange

Palate: 4* Lighter, oak spices, dark chocolate, cigar smoke, serrano ham

Finish: 4,5* Long lasting, spicy wood, ashy, bonfire smoke, honey marinade

Elegantly smoked, though not sophisticated. Funky but in the best way possible.
Full bodied with a great balance. Finish lasts forever. Fantastic value."

4.75,"Nose: Intense peat smoke with iodine. Stone and tropical fruit, sherry, vanilla and Lapsang Souchong tea. Bandaids.

Flavor: Rich, sweet, complex, smooth. Smoke, iodine, peat. Brine, pineapple, vanilla, orange zest, cherry, rubber, barley-malt. back of the throat is buttery, salt, pepper, and smoke. Finishes long, warm and peppery but still sweet. Balanced. 

Water cools the heat and brings out Indian curry notes. A stone brings out molasses, vanilla, sweetness. Both slightly dull complexity.  Prefer this one neat.

The finest whisky(or any spirit) I’ve ever tasted and not sure it’s really close. 4.75/5 to leave room for a surprise contender but I doubt that’s happening."

4.75,"This is quite simply one of the best single malts out there. The nose is smoky, but there’s not an overpowering saltiness like with Ardbeg and Laphroaig (both of which are among my favorite scotches as well.) Peat continues onto first taste, but it’s remarkably balanced and smooth down to the finish. It’s more expensive than its Islay counterparts, but it’s worth the additional price."

4.75,"Reading reviews I thought this was going to be a peat bomb. Maybe I've had so many peated drams that my palate has adjusted to them. The big flavor I get is BBQ brisket. It's meaty in flavor AND in body. As you taste, you get that deeeeep smoke and meat, but then it lifts off you and get vanilla and those lighter scotch flavors. Which totally blew my mind. I was not expecting it but I love it because it's so smooth. Complex, exciting, and delicious. Highly recommend."

4.75,"I've had a bottle of this before, but never reviewed it, and anyways, it's been a few years since I've tried it. I got my brother-in-law hooked on whisky, and this was what he offered on a recent visit. Thought I'd share a few notes after several years (and several drams in between) this classic pour.

Despite past whinging about low ABV, I'm somehow not bothered by the 43% here. There's still plenty of dense, meaty peat to be found in this dram. Over the years I've gradually tried other offerings from Lagavulin, but to my taste at least, nothing is able to stand up to the standard 16. This spirit just really does well with time in the barrel. The 8 and 9 year old offerings of the past few years have been good, but that extra 7-8 years in the barrel give this dram a depth of flavor and a profile that is so very unique, even amongst Islay pours. In addition to the rich, meaty peat, there's a deep, almost overly tannic oak to the palate, and as a unique part of the finish, spearmint, which isn't to be found in other expressions.

I'm no fan of Diageo. They seem (perhaps rightfully so in their minds) more interested in the bottom line than making sure everything they put out is a quality product. I'm not a fan of their passing on the new tariffs to the consumer almost instantly after the new year. I'm not a fan that this is now $110 in Texas. But damn if this isn't good whisky, and damn it all if I won't shell out the money for it. Curse you Diageo and your soulless milking of your loyal consumers. You know we'll pay..."

4.25,"Peaty and meaty smell. Not too harsh. Fresh notes of citrus, green apple and freshly cut grass linger behind the smoke. 
The peat is dominant in the taste, but soon you are welcomed by an oily and fruity taste of apples, pear, and vanilla. Very full and fruity. 
Caramel and a subtle oakiness dominate the finish"

4.5,"Super smooth, doesn’t come at you too fast, but when it does, so much smoke, spice, meat, peat it’s crazy. But then after a few sips you start to realize there’s more to it and find some sweetness. Like if you barbecued a steak and then the some roasted cherries on top."

5.0,"When you initially embark into the odyssey of this liquid gold masterpiece, you feel as if you’re sitting at a backyard barbecue. Not like you’re just smelling the barbecue down the street as you walk your dogs by, but you are IN the barbecue. The sweet, the smoke, the meat, the burn. You are on the grill beside the porterhouse inhaling the fumes of the charcoal flames and that glorious red meat. Then after the smoke of the grill, just for a fleeting instance, you’re all gathered around the pool eating fresh homemade vanilla ice cream. It’s just a microcosm of a moment: solely so the sweetness doesn’t burst through the pallet as the forerunner of flavor; that’s alright, just a suggestion of sweetness is more than enough. After sweetness foolishly thought it had a chance, we’re back to the town of flavor with the taste of either of these three: 1.) a freshly burned, liquified Sharpie, 2.) a freshly felled white oak tree on a warm summer’s eve, or 3.) a fresh mouthful of smoldered ashes, most likely from an incinerated cigar factory. The interpretation, and choice, are up to the individual experience. I’m not here to judge, friends. 

Whichever flavor you experience, you experience it not only from your oral cavity, but furthermore via your nose, eyes, and ears. It’s due to the actuality this scotch never lets up from commencement to culmination. Even hours after you acquire that first memorable, incandescent sip you can sense it making its voyage down to your toes. And, really, what more could you ever aspire for?

This is my special scotch to drink - the “Oh, you just got married? That’s not special enough to drink my Lagavulin” scotch. 

Five stars."
4.0,"The king of the smoky Islay malts. Like drinking an ashtray. Cigar smoke on the nose, cigar smoke and caramelized toffee flavors, and an immensely warming finish. You are either in the mood for this, or you aren't. No two ways about it."

On the nose the first note I get is bacon, bacon flavored dog treats to be precise. Some charred wood, burnt rubber, leather, camp fire by the beach. Amazing.

On the palate I get smoke meats, sweet peat (not as medicinal as Ardbeg/Laphroaig) cigar ash/tobacco, BBQ chips, it warms your chest and comes back up with some crushed pepper.

Finish is long with more delicious BBQ smoked meats notes. Fantastic scotch."
