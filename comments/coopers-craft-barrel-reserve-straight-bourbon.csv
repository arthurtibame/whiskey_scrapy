3.0,There’s a lot going on here which I’m assuming is caused by their aging process. Interesting to see how opening up the barrel inside affected the flavor. Very tasty!
3.75,Revisited this a couple days after opening.  Significantly better!
3.5,"Harsh at first with wood, and then finishes with a bit of a rich fudge taste. The wood sugars and flavors are there, they just have become deeper and older, it seems."

3.5,"I like this. Big bold flavors and some heat. I get the oak, cinnamon and toffee. The back end brings the heat on the throat. A bit astringent on the front. This may not be dialed in all the way, but I like that for $30, it seems to try to hit out of its weight class. I imagine that people will like or hate this."

2.5,"Coopers Craft Barrel Reserve has a very nice dark amber color.  The aroma is of oak, oak, and some more oak with some caramel, vanilla.   There is a alcohol presence here.  The legs did not start down the glass for a while and when they started they ran very slow.  The taste reminds me of fresh cut wood with quite a bit of alcohol burn on the tongue.  The caramel, brown sugar, and vanilla follow.  The finish is a medium to long with the oak being the main thing that lingers.  If you like big oak then this is the bourbon for you.  The tongue burn that normally subsides on most bourbons seems to stick with this one."

4.0,"Very well done bourbon and surely an upgrade in flavor and body compared to original Coopers Craft. Rich with great sweet brown sugar and baking spice note...reminiscent of fresh baked apple pie on the nose plus a terrific dose of wood. On the palate you pick up more of the same, well balanced, easy drinking, very smooth and a medium finish. Great price point too, a great daily driver. Cheers!"

3.5,A better version of Jefferson’s Twin Oak. Stronger with more flavor. Very good for $30! Definitely worth trying
3.5,"A very drinkable bourbon.  While it’s 100 proof it’s a very easy smooth sip.  A good everyday drink.

3.75,The vanilla really comes out in this one. The expert review of crispy corners of brownies is exactly right. A good sipping bourbon. Smooth and very short finish. Astringent at the end like a mildly oversteeped tea.
4.0,"Smooth, little heat, tasty!"
3.5,Smooth bonded nice

4.5,This whiskey is not some easy sipper and it knows it it is butch with strong robust flavours of wood and char and I love all of it if your a fan of oaky and woody whiskeys I highly recommend this
3.5,Warm apple pie with tons of cinnamon

3.25,Got a lot of alcohol smell at first after I waited a bit I got a great fruity banana smell. I got lost of oak and still the fruity light banana flavor. I was very pleasantly surprised and a good deal at 30$.  Pretty short finish with some acid aftertaste but would definitely get again for a change of pace.

3.75,"I was looking to pick up a couple new items as social distancing was spreading across the U.S. in March. When I saw Cooper's Craft I immediately grabbed it, knowing little about it other than recalling some YouTube bourbon videos thought it was a good addition to the market. When I realized this was a new Brown-Forman product I was thrilled.

The nose has a heavy oak char, with dark fruit, brown sugar, and light banana. Compared to other cheap Brown-Forman whiskeys, the oak really stands out. I believe the advertising when it says the barrels have chiseled grooves to increase contact. The nose is on par with Old Forester Whiskey Row series. It is oak forward on the tongue with dark fruit and some sugar, zero banana detected. It is not smooth whatsoever and drinks true to the proof, which I appreciate. I don't think the beech/birch charcoal has nearly as much influence as the maple charcoal does with Jack Daniel's and Michter's. Finish is medium, primarily tannic oak which may be a turnoff for some. 

I think this whiskey punches above its weight. I believe it is a good deal at $34 and would be fair at a $40 price point since I think this is better than Woodford Reserve. I wish I was at my apartment instead of my parent's house so I could do a blind taste test with Michter's bourbon. Because I have not tried Old Forester Signature 100, I may pick it up and retry blind, because that may be the most similar product available."

4.0,"CC Barrel Reserve

*NOSE: Pours into the Glencairn a great dark copper color. Lots of Black Pepper Spice initially, but it fades with time to reveal Barrel Wood, Light Florals, Citrus, Burnt Brown Sugar, Vanilla, and Graham Cracker Crust.
*NEAT: Very reminiscent of a Value Priced OF1910 or Woodford DO. Thick & Clingy mouthfeel. Big hit of Sweet Vanilla with Lots of Oak. Dark Chocolate, Caramel, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon Oil, all backed by a Black Pepper Tingle. Just a hint of a Bitter Medicinal Note. Despite the 100proof, not much Heat on the finish with a nice Sweet Oak coating the palate, though the more it layers a slight bitterness creeps in.
 *SPLASH: At first, a couple drops of water had me concerned. It didn't affect the nose much, but the palate became Very Bitter on first taste. Luckily, this didn't last. The deeper sweetness was eventually replaced with lighter Melted Honey Butter. The mouthfeel gets even clingier.

*VERDICT: After finishing my initial pour and nosing an empty glass that smells delightfully of unlit cigar and cinnamon, I was vacillating between a score of 3.75 and 4. Am I over rating it because I was so surprised by how much I liked it over the standard CC? It was surprisingly good, especially at the sale price of $29. The scoring of the barrel staves really has a positive effect. It was sweet and peppery and had a great clingy mouthfeel. An Oaky aftertaste that lasted long after I was done with it. It does get dinged just a tad by its adverse reaction to water (I didn't care for it on ice at all as it became bitter, bitter, bitter), but Neat it's as good as any BF product I've had. 4 Stars it is."

1.75,"I've been told this is one of those bottles to chase down before prices go up and the hype gets out of hand. I've also been told that as it opens up, it kinda goes flat so i'm reviewing my second pour (maybe 3rd....I had a few drink the last time i opened this so I might have gone for seconds). 

nose -well my first thought is I get brown foreman, or more directly I get old forester. Some chocolate, almost a raisin that's been oak soaked, brown sugar, a touch of maple, caramel...and this might sound crazy but it's almost got a dr pepper meets rootbeer thing going on. All classic elements I get in certain brown foreman expressions.  

taste - so I get a from start to finish light oak note, I don't always get oak at the very start, but it never goes from being just this light oak flavor. This is on the sweet side and yet it's somewhat bold. Vanilla, oak, a bit acidic, a touch of maybe banana, the finish has some youth to it with a bit of alcohol flavor in a bit unpleasant way. There's some chocolate as well. After some water I'm starting to get a touch of a nutty note at the end, all mixed in with that chocolaty, dr pepper/rootbeer note. 

Overall this is pretty good for 30 bucks. I could see myself icing this one however as the finish is clearly showing some youth off. Still for 28 bucks, this is a pretty nice bourbon and at 100 proof I'm all about recommending it as an alternative budget bourbon for those where 30 is budget. 

1.75 out of 5. 2.0 is an average whisky. 1.0 is quality all be it not something I enjoy, below a 1.0 is simply not worth drinking. Please note, my average whisky is based on well over a decade of drinking and a willingness to explore some rather expensive and amazing spirits."
3.0,Excellent value and a good pour. Try it.
