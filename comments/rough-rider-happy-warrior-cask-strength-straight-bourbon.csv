4.0,"Initial nose vanilla, sweet sharp back.  Once iced evened out the ending sharp."
3.0,"Got a bottle as a gift from my son. The nose is kind of flat, although the 114 proof isn't as hot as you would think. The pallet is mildly sweet with a hint of the wine cask. Finish is spicy and satisfying.  All in all it has a somewhat unique flavor profile that I like. Something tells me this one won't gather much dust!"

4.0,"Wow, that’s definitely a bit better than the standard proof RR. The wine notes are mostly welcome musty fruit overtones on a hot, spicy core. @Zslug @OtisDB"
