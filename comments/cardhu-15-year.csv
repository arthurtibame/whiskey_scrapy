4.0,"Nose of honey and some vanilla, fruits even. Palate is rich, honey with even a wisp of smoke and some wood comes through. Finish is smooth and medium length. Leaves you wanting another mouthful. Nice whisky and want another!"

4.0,"This was the first scotch I tried. I was a bourbon only drinker until I got a bottle of this from my uncle for christmas last year. I really damn liked it back than, and it seems I still like it now. 

On the nose you get a heavy dose of chocolate, raisins, some plums, cinnamon and slight vanilla. 

That mostly continues on the taste, with a dash of honey and a bit of pepper. Cinnamon and raisins stay strong, but the light sweet chocolate from the nose turns into a dark bitter chocolate that fits perfect with the lighter, sweeter honey notes. 

The dark chocolate stays with you, as does a slight hint of gingerbread and raisins. 

It's a speyside, so peatheads won't have much to explore, but for us who like it a bit sweeter/lighter, but not overly sugary, this is an excelent dram. Whoever sold that bottle to my uncle knew what they were doing."

3.0,"A weaker offering than the 12. There are notes of dark chocolate, almonds and dried fruits that are almost reminiscent of sherry, all great things, but none of them work well together. The oak aroma is particularly cruel on this expression, with a finish that is off-putting."
