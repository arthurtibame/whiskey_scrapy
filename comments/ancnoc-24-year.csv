4.5,"A very fruity whisky, filling the nostrils with pineapple, mango, peach and orange. Milk chocolate, marzipan, coffee powder and the heat of the malt complete and round the nose, enveloping and sinuous. Over time, a freshest and more balsamic note is perceived, with a lemon zest.
Malt and wood welcome the palate, very waxy and sherried, with liqueur raisins, hazelnuts, cinnamon, tropical fruit, candied orange, vanilla. Consistent with the nose, including the balsamic note on the background.
Fairly long and dry finish, made of wood, malt, orange and hazelnut.
Softly elegant and sober, a peaceful whisky, able to balance the influence of sherry, getting the best out of it without being overwhelmed."
4.5,"Nose - Dark honey, sweet red berries, caramel, ripe pears & apples, raisins, hint of orange zest

Taste - Gentle ginger spice/heat/tingle, sweet red berries, ripe pear, light chocolate, light tannic/bitter black tea, hint of orange zest, dark honey

Finish - Lingering gentle ginger spice, fruity honey, sweet pear, light red berries, light tannic black tea

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - This is quite a nice dram. Great nose, nice balance on the tongue, great from start to finish. The tannic over steeped black tea notes are a bit distracting, but otherwise quite tasty. Good light sherry influence to add some red berries to a great honey/pear backdrop.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"

5.0,FOUR years of further maturation in sherry!!!
4.25,"3cL Sample from Fine Drams

Nose: Caramel delights; rich, but still smooth
Palate: Wow.  Cedar, heat, sherry, raisin, mild iodine
Finish: VERY Long, but surprisingly muted.  Woody and mild smoke.  
Water brings out the cream.

I'm getting much less of the vanilla notes I was expecting until that finish.

A nice sweet dram, but may be a bit too rich for Scotchtoberfest."

4.0,"Definitely one that needs time and a few drops of water. The official tasting notes are spot on. Caramel, toffee, marmalade etc. Finish is warm and slightly drying and astringent. I like this one and think it's a distillery whose offerings improve with age. Solid 4"

4.0,"My first encounter with this distillery suggests it’s another candidate for the value-for-money club. Two dozen years of maturation have yielded a classic Highlands malt with some well integrated sherry influence. There’s buttered toast on the nose and warm malty bread on the palate, accompanied all along by a well-tuned harmony of rich sherry flavors - spices, fruit cake and marmalade. The medium-long finish starts pleasantly sweet  before turning a little dry. For as little as $135 a bottle, it’s a steal for the age, especially when your local bar isn’t marking up the cost of a 2oz pour."

5.0,"Nose: rich and inviting, nut toffee, slight floral
Palate:  rich, smooth, brown sugar, phantom spice, toasted nut... cashew?
Long finish:  Vanilla.... like butter cookies, wood - oak?  Rain on cement
Lovely, lovely dram. Well worth the price.  A beautiful find."
4.0,"Not a sherry bomb (hate that expression), but you definitely know this ain't an ex-bourbon aged whisky. 

Delicious, with notes of almond paste, candied fruits and baking spices. A touch of water reveals further notes of crême brulée and nutmeg.

A worthy AnCnoc."

3.0,"This is definitely for those with a sweet tooth. The malt and sherry create a unique arrangement of aromas: Cookie Dough, Raisinets, Vanilla chews, and Cream sherry. The palate is equally decadent, Malt balls, Dates, and Mint Chocolate. It drys out on the finish which is a tad short.

It's a bit too sweet for me but perhaps not for you."

5.0,"This one is something special. It stays true to AnCnoc's house style, but everything is intensified. 24 years of sherry cask maturation have led to a beautifully sweet and spicy character. Vanilla, toffee, custard, candied citrus peel, and dark, jammy fruits dominate up front. After about 10 minutes in the glass, the spiciness kicks in on the nose and finish, accompanied by gentle notes of mulling spices and leather. Body and mouthfeel are fabulous to boot as the whisky is quite oily. The perfect late-night dram."
