3.75,"I didn’t find much of a nose, but the taste is rich and malty, with dark chocolate notes. The finish is the best part - very long flavors of oak spice, dark chocolate, black tea and dark honey. Best of the four whiskies I’ve reviewed from this distillery."
4.5,"In celebration of their 50th anniversary, Deanston released the Decennary which is a blend of four of their single malts: 1977 whisky refill, 1982 American oak, 1996 port pipe, 2006 Predro Ximenez. It is an un-chilled filtered whisky finished in oak casks. 

My tasting notes:

N - apples, cherries and honey
T - sherry, citrus, nuts and chocolate
F - light peat blows away the front and turns into a honey sweet finish that lingers. 

The bottle description adds that there should be a bit of toffee on the nose and aromatic spices in the taste. 

We bought this bottle at the distillery. It is a fantastic release and the best expression of Deanston I’ve had thus far."
