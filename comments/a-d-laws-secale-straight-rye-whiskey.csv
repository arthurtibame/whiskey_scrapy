1.0,"Nose - Very sharp sweet red berry/ethanol cleaning product note, alcoholic mint-berry windex, vanilla buttercream frosting after a while.

Taste - Very splenda-sweet medicinal mint berry cough drops, vanilla simple with orange zest, light cocoa nib bittersweet, drying tannic heat.

Finish - Lingering cocoa nib/orange bittersweet, very splenda-like artificial sweet, diabetes sweet spearmint.

Score - 10/100

Final Thoughts - At least to me, there is nothing about this whiskey that is pleasant. It smelled like a cleaning product targeted towards kids, tasted like one, and left a very unpleasant splenda/equal sweet taste. Maybe secale rye isn't for me? Regardless I couldn't find anything I liked about this one and I went back & forth on how low a score I could reasonably give this one as it will probably be my benchmark for bad whiskey. I settled on 10/100 because they bothered to make something & actually bottle it for sale. I think if I actually purchased a bottle of this, I'd probably go back & demand my money back it was so bad. If I could give this 0 stars, I would."

2.25,"So—-the bad news first :  one more hour of a flight delay at Denver.  I already had one AD Laws Four Grain for the first hour delay...now this for the second hour.  Hopefully no more delays—-two pours is all I can manage 

Weak nose.  Very un-rye. Palette is weak...I was hoping for more punch.  

If you’re in CO and want to try a local spirit, it’s worth the experience.  But don’t waste your suitcase space in picking up a bottle.  There’s better ryes there for a fraction of the price."
