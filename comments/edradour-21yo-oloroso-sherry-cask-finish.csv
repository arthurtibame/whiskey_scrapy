5.0,"Spectacular dram from ""Scottish little gem"". Edradour has proven me that they make perfect whiskies, obviously taken advantage of their marvelous sherry casks. This one is their 21yo expression, an Oloroso Sherry Finish. 

Bottled at 56.2% it has an amazing deep copper color. 

On the nose: perfect score. Coffee, Orange caramel, Brown sugar, Cherries; Sherry wine that feels old and thick.Thick caramel. Letting it breath will release a chocolate note. Vanilla with dulce de leche. Awesome. 

On the palate: (CAPS LOCK) OUT OF THIS WORLD!! VANILLA, SHERRY, CHERRIES, DRIED FRUITS, CHOCOLATE, MILK POWDER. ALL AT THE SAME TIME. 
25 Points +1 since it is so good.

Aftertaste is also perfect. Dry feeling from the oloroso sherry. Tobacco, Milk powder and Milka Chocolate. 

This might win whisky of the year this tear for me. (I know it is going to be on my top 3) my score for it is....

101 over 100. It is THAT good. Go buy it. Sláinte Mhath."
