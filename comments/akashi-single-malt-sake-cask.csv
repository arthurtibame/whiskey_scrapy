5.0,"A single cask distillery exclusive where they put sake in a Bourbon barrel so they could let their single malt sit in it for 3 years. 

Big strong sweet kick to it, with a spice that runs underneath it all. Spice and richness pair well, and there's too many flavors for my knowledge level to even try to pick out. Love it though, unique."
