3.5,I think musky is a good description.  I like it better than either Bushmills or Jameson.  Will be buying more as long as the price is reasonable.
4.0,"The oldest to come FROM Ireland. Like, anyone who left Belfest in 1776, had a bottle of this. Similar to Bushmills, it's good core whiskey from Ireland. Fresh, Grainy.. sipper."

3.5,"Tastes like a mix between Irish whiskey and scotch. Musky and slightly smoky. This is a good introduction whiskey to scotch, and it is also good to get if you want an Irish whiskey that is just different. Relatively smooth for the price."
4.5,Really nice Irish taste; compares favorably to more expensive bottles. Will be buying more.
