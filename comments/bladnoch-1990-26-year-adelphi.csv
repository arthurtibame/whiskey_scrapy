4.0,"The strength on this bottle is impressive given the age, yet it was surprisingly easy to drink neat. My notes from the Adelphi event were getting a bit sketchy by the time we got around to this, the 8th drink of the evening, but the nose was “rich and fruity” and the palate “orange.” Regardless, I know I enjoyed it enough to say it’s yet another Adelphi bottle that I would be happy to add to my collection."
