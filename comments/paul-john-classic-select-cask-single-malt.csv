3.5,"This is a weird one. Most of a bottle done and I'm still grappling with it.

This needs water. The alcohol is punchy. My problem is... Coconut. I get the tropical fruit and a touch of mild spice. But I get coconut and I'm not sure I like it in this context. It confuses me. I want to like it but I'm struggling.

So. An adventure. Different and maybe too young but packed with flavour. Dammit!

Feel my pain, people!"
4.0,"No reason to not enjoy this whisky. Aroma is fun and fruity with a light tropical fruit essence hiding under the heavier orchard fruit layer; Palate is rich, heavy and bold with a wall of complex fruit; Finish is a warm bold fade of its core notes."
4.0,"Good stuff. The flavors remind me more of an aged rum than a whiskey, but they are still very nice. I find it a bit too much to drink without water or ice. Probably a misuse of such expensive whiskey but I've enjoyed it most Old Fadhioned and Manhattan cocktails. The high proof and flavors make it awesome for cocktails."

4.0,"Very nice but a bit hot. Nose has a bit of nuttiness to me with vanilla and spice. On the palate, mutual sweet vanilla flavor followed by spice then a oakey finish. There’s definitely some heat at the end as well. Adding water seems to make it sweeter without affecting the heat. Really like the taste. The finish is long."

2.0,No 2 on my Paul John tasting spree. Honey and liquorice as per tasting notes. I was advised not to add water but this definitely needs it. Few drops opened up a bit but preferred even less to the Brilliance
