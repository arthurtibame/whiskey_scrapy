4.0,Holy smokes! I was not expecting the level of complexity this whisky puts forward considering its age. The people at Last Mountain have put SK distilling on the radar and I couldn't be happier about it. Very excited for what they come out with next. (They've also bumped the ABV up to 45% which does a lot for this offering!)
4.0,"I just came across this great find while visiting Saskatchewan.  The nose caught my interest with a hint of oak and spice that became sweeter with time. When tasting I found it sweet with vanilla and caramel. The mouth feel was very pleasant, coating but not thick or oily. After a few more sips orange came up and wood or wood spice. The finish is warm, but short. I am left with more orange and a little bitterness. Maybe it's the young age showing in the finish.  This is the only  Last Mountain I have tried , but I enjoyed it and will keep an eye on this distiller! (3.5 to 4 Stars) also 45% ABV"
