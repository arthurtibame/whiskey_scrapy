5.0,Had single barrel #60. Great 90 proof bourbon at $35. Was told it was 2 years old and 60% corn. Definitely one of the better craft bourbons I've tasted....by a distillery that actually makes its bourbon. Excited to see what this becomes in a few more years.

3.25,"Not much on the nose.  Slight vanilla/caramel

Taste was sweet, more vanilla, and oak on the finish. 

Real good for a young bourbon."

4.0,This is my 3rd bottle. Barrel #139. I absolutely love it. Lots of vanilla on the palate and smells like a bag of candy. Good amount of caramel nose and palate. Pleasantly coats the tongue
