3.0,Watered down. Very little afterburn. Bad taste. Don't return.
4.0,"Good stuff here. Lots of vanilla sweetness, a touch of walnut like nuttiness, and a bit of spice. If you like wheaters, give it a shot."

3.5,"A great wheated bottled in bond bourbon, especially for the price.   Fairly sweet with a fair share of vanilla."
5.0,"This was OK, It represents a good value, Definite Spicy, Nutty, Woody notes consistent through both the nose and the palate. Kinda have to hunt for this though..."

3.0,"Nose- Vanilla, butter, and a hint of cinnamon 
Body- Toast with jelly and caramel.
Finish- The Vanilla really comes back here wi h a bit of milk chocolate. 

Had on the rocks at Bullit’s Brewery and BBQ. It is a good drink for rocks."

3.5,"Poured neat in a Glencairn at Jack Rose Saloon in DC.  Have recently gotten into BIBs, and really wanted to try this one but not sold in Virginia.  Nose is mild, with caramel and oak. Sweet, no heat.  Taste is more sharp, though not too much, with mild spice, toffee, lingering bittersweet.  Decent. 7/4/19"
