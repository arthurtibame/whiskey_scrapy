2.75,"Nose: A very light cereal/gristy nose with some ambiguous floral notes. Nutty and slightly herbal/grassy with the lightest touch of lemon and mint. A barely discernible ethanol aroma. As it opens it gains a little fullness and you can just make out some oak.

Palate: A soft and smooth arrival featuring barley and other cereal flavours. Crisp and fresh. This carries on into the development which doesn't add much, apart from a little gingery/lemon spiciness. There is a very nice mouth-coating oiliness and a touch of honey in the late development.

Finish: Short, citrus flavours leading into a sweet finale, like bittersweet lemon drops.

I found this to be surprisingly enjoyable. It's lightweight to be sure, but it isn't ashamed of itself and struts its cereal-centric personality with aplomb.  In some ways I prefer it to the older brother 12 year old, which is very buttery and vanilla. Here you find an exuberant, youthful spirit begging to be appreciated for what it is.

A dash of water makes the nose a little deeper but loses the cereal freshness. It muddies the palate and frankly spoils it, turning the lemon into sour lemon zest.  I'd recommended taking this neat (however it does make a very nice highball and is a good mixer in general, the lemon/cereal personality balancing sweet soft drinks).

At the price it is remarkably good value. In Australia it's $42 which makes it a competitor against the lower-middleweight blended whiskies, and it more than punches at its weight.

No great classic, not a huge personality, but no real flaws either. In many ways it's comparable to Macallan Gold - less fully featured for sure, but also way less than half the price. A very acceptable budget sipping whisky for summer.

""Average"" : 2.75 stars"

The kinetic feel when you first grab the bottle to pour your first enjoyable glass is remarkable! The bottle fits so well into either hand it is a wonderful fit for Left handed or  Right hand pouring! There are flavors here that are typically present of an aged single malt scotch whiskey. However, this Elgin Classic is NAS yeilding equal flavors of a fine Aged SMSW!
This me friends is me new go-to me new standard! I will be enjoying this for a long time to come neat with friends and family a like!
BTW this might be good on the rocks but it was so Enjoyable I didn't Temp the Enjoyment I was enjoying with me wife sipping this fine spirit!

2.75,"A value single malt that is neither bad nor good. It’s unfortunately a bit young and the edges are somewhat sharp. The flavors come though as a honeyed, fruity, slightly dark caramel quality, with a full, sweet body. The lack of maturity is quite evident in the price and the flavor. It hasn’t been barreled long enough to soften the spirit. 

Either drop down to a faster-maturing blended scotch for the same money, or drop a shelf down and get a budget scotch very has much better value. Barring that, spend a few more dollars per bottle and get the 12 year."

0.5,"Nose: Somewhat fruity and sweet. Shortbread kind of comes through but not as strong as their packaging suggests.

Palate: Malty. Some citrus fruit trying to come through. Very light and a little oily. 

Finish: Brief. Slightly sour. Oily. Shortbread is stronger here than on the nose. Not very pleasant.

Overall Thoughts: I did not enjoy this. I bought it two years ago and I’m glad I didn’t spent a lot on it. I wouldn’t recommend it. This missed the mark."

2.5,"I liked the 12 yr so wanted to try this low cost entry. Poured neat, nose is a little floral with light malt, fruit and unripe banana.Soft mouthfeel leads to palate of thin malt, mild green banana, oak and even some back door peat bringing mild coffee note. Hotter than proof would indicate but bottle mellows after some time. Finishes short to medium with drying oak and some slight bitterness with malt coffee note in background. This is a young scotch lacking body and depth but getting a single malt in the low 20's is hard to find. Its better than most blends without dreaded low grade(hangover inducing) grain alcohol. However if you are looking to get into single malt scotch this is not where to start. Its ok but would not repurchase........76/100......not bad as a light scotch to stretch your good stuff however Speyburn Bradan Orach is better for less"

3.75,"Mellow and smooth with a hint of citrus, grass and cinnamon apple along with toffee and butter. It will leave you with a glazy ever so slight peaty bite and smoked oak after taste. Open up the full bouquet with one cube of ice and it becomes a tad more floral with a bit of a black licorice afterbite. Great every day scotch for the price and a bit of a shape shifter. Lovely mixer for cola or sparkling mineral (peligrino) water. Give it a go and feel the flow, cheers!"
