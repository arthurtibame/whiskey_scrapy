3.0,cough syrup sweetness with an underlying bitterness and slight spiciness. the cork on this bottle is really loose and I don't know if it has affected the flavour on this

4.0,"Viva la France!  My first French whiskey ( you never forget your first, right?). Courtesy of Richard.  This I believe comes from Breton, where the dialect is distinctly non-typical French and the distance to the U.K. is a mere tunnel ride.  It's also where crepes were invented, so there you go---this already looks promising. Aromas of hazelnuts and raisins.  Palette is more nuts and dark berries, almost Christmas-y spices.  I wish this had more time to age---I'm going to be a buyer of this at a mature age statement.  Thanks Richard!"
4.0,"This charming dram greets you with a beautiful combination of apricots, leather, tobacco and sherry on the nose. The palate is a gentle medley of raisins, walnuts, roasted coffee and hint of citrus. The finish is long, warm and features a certain je-ne-sais-quoi from the oak spice. Overall, a fragrant, complex and delicious dram. Merci et bravo!"

4.0,"Vive le whiskey Français, and what a great discover! The thing about sherry is that it isn't unlike a hairpiece. If you have a full set of hair and use a hairpiece as extensions, the finished look is natural and seamless. But if you're bald and walking around with a toupee... you're only fooling yourself. Point is: this is a great whiskey because the new-made spirit was well-crafted before aging, and you can tell. The sherry... just a wonderful bonus. From start to finish both the nose and palate are complex and delicious with predictable fruity notes , and the finish is smooth and long. Bravo!"
