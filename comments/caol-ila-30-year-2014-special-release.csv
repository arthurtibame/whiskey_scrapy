5.0,"Oh. My. God. On our whisky journey, there eventually comes a moment where we instantly realize: this is it. The one Single Malt we have always been looking for. Caol Ila 30 is the crown of the distillery's OB (bottle no. 0181, 55.1% ABV). Smoldering bonfire smoke, distant citrus fruits and notes of an old, earthy salt cellar enchant the nose. On the palate, the sweet and sour arrival migrates towards vegetal peatiness with well-balanced, mildly bitter wood spices. And the finish? Excellent. Intense, aromatic and slowly abating. Dare I say perfect? Slàinte!

RATING: 5.0/5.0 stars ≙ 95 pts → PERFECT"

4.75,Wish I had more time with this one. This was amazing. Instant sweet that quickly disappeared and became Smokey brine and on the nose crushed sea shells. I know that sounds weird but I spent a lot of time in Central America and my wife would collect sea shell put them in a jar and they smell the same as the caol ila 30. There is a sour note and a citrus note. Need more time. Fantastic.
