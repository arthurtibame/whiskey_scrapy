4.0,"This bourbon is a pleasure to drink neat or accompanied with a small cube. A fully proofed-robust nose is followed by a spicy and toasty finish.

Too proud to be a mixer, this bourbon is an excellent sip over a war story."

3.0,"The Horse Soldier line needs to be addressed by the moderators. There are three current offerings; straight, small batch, and single barrel. 

This is in reference to the Small Batch. There is a separate listing on Distiller for Single Barrel. Small Batch is 47.5 ABV or 95 proof. 

Putting aside marketing stories and concentrating on the contents, this is an average pour. I keep trying to get excited about it. 

Today's tasting is with a single large cube in a rocks glass. Even chilled and diluted it's obvious this is a young bourbon. The nose is more sophisticated than Very Old Barton BiB, but a step down from Knob Creek or WT 101. 

This tastes like a high rye whiskey and with a 60/30/10 mash bill, it is. This reminds me a lot of Old Grand Dad (which I like a lot). All told, this is a bit brash, young and hot but it has a good taste foundation. I'm sure a little more age will elevate it, as will an NCF Single Barrel at full proof. 

But...

This doesn't work on the taste-value matrix. This tastes like an okay $30 bottle, but it sells for more than double that.

There is NO WAY I'm selecting this over a KC single barrel at under $50, or OGD114 under $40, or any number of others.

Hard pass on another bottle... Maybe have other expressions at a bar, but I don't see Small Batch in my rotation."
3.0,"This whiskey pours a light amber and shows thin sheeting with quick, thin legs   on the swirl.

The nose offers up fresh cut wood, slight vanilla and ethanol notes.

The flavor is thin, subtle and grain & wood oriented. There's not a lot of fruit, sweetness, or complexity. It's actually kind of boring."
3.25,At Westgate Grill. Just ride horses today 12.28.19 w/ Chuds and Nana and Doc. Got short poured. Good taste very short aftertaste. 112 proof some spice.
4.0,"This was a gift from a fellow Army Vet and to be truthful my expectations were low. There's too many new releases that are marketing ploys, or as we say ""all hat and no cattle"". I believe these guys are doing it the right way. My bottle is the barrel strength at 114 proof and I am told it's an 8 year-old with a mash bill of 70% corn, 20% wheat, and 10% barley. Drinking neat at 114 proof brings some heat, sweet heat since it a high corn wheated bourbon. Adding a splash of water does open it up with a little more depth. With ice you also get toasted oak, baking spices, dark fruit flavors. I found my favorite pour is on the rocks. A little pricey for an every day drinker, but I could see pairing this with a good Cuban cigar."

4.5,"Rather woody on the nose, but upon tasting it has nice notes of baking spices, leather, and brown sugar that sweetens toward a medium finish, but with a little bit of spiciness on the back end. Drinks a tad hot, but being a barrel strength whiskey it should, and provides a nice ""Kentucky Hug."""
