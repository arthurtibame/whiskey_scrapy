4.0,"Now that the nice staff of @Distiller added this bottle I will use that occasion to put out my review. I have this bottle for a while now and had a few drams already. I got this bottle after I had a sample of the 18y which I really liked. I also have other Arran whiskies because I am starting to become a little fanboy for them. Really nice distillery and whisky. 

Nose: wine gummies, red sour grapes, marzipan with honey, mixed citrus fruits, white chocolate, grains, close to become turned yellow autumn apples, white nougat / Turkish honey. Even if this is what a lot of whiskies offer on their nose Arran has something special in between it all which I can’t really define but is what I really like about it. The alcohol isn’t very present but that is probably result of the Norlan glass I use at the moment. A really well put together collection of aromas. James Mac Taggart knows his stuff. It a nose that you simply like. 

Palate: starts of really mild and mellow / smooth. Then it puts an interesting coat on your tongue that is made of dates, chili, dried green herbs, dark chocolate and a bid of earthyness (mushrooms) which in combination is very pleasant. It becomes more woody / oaky later and goes down with a warming sweet and cotton-like chili burn. 

The finish is great. Caramel, dried fruits, herbs and some fruity orange-like sourness while being all smooth and oily. 

Water release more sweetness and also more alcohol on the nose. 

Recommended but I have to say the 18y from what I remember it was nearly equally good. The 21y is smoother though, goes deeper in its aromas and has a longer finish."
