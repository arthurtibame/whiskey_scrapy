3.0,"Nose: Spices, peat, honey and vanilla, bourbon kind of nose, the peat stays more on the back. Hints of lime in the mix.

Taste: The taste stays very thin. Notes of grass and citrus, lightly salty with peat.  

Finish: Spicy and bit dry. With hints of lime again. Wee peat smoke.

Balance: Probably the first Islay whisky, that is so light in every way? I'm not talking only about the lack of smoke or peat. Bunnahabhain has done it already and still their whiskies tend to have character. I think, that this Bowmore has not. Bigger alcohol per volume level would've made this more forceful."

3.0,"Smoky and sweet. A palatable smoky scotch.

Tasted at Bowmore Distillery on 7/26/2016"
4.0,Nose of smoke peat and brine which follow through on the pallet. Then a faint sweetness of caramel comes in and finishes with more smoke which lasts longer than expected.  A nice entry into peated malts.

3.0,"Color of a beautiful gold (very fake, of course), the nose appears somewhat pale and ephemeral: herbaceous traits combined with fruity aromas, on a rather marked layer of sweetness. The influence of Bourbon is clear (the barrels are a mix of ex-Bourbon first fill and re-filled), but the typical Bowmore seafaring is lacking. Even the peat is struggling to emerge, very feeble. Not bad, but somewhat impersonal.
In the mouth, the herbaceous notes become more salty (and thank goodness, I was worrying!), a bitterish tip appears next to vanilla and a pinch of dried fruit. Here the peat is always felt in the background, more present than the nose, but on the whole the aromas are all a little weak, just mentioned, there is not that decisive and round flavor that catches you. Easy to drink, yes, but too much.
The finish leaves a little alcohol (which at 40 degrees is almost a blasphemy), peat (more than the nose and palate, funny thing) and a sweet / salty sensation, all for a rather short time."

3.0,Vegetal smoke that moves into a briny sweetness. A tad bitter on the finish with a bit of acrid smoke.
4.0,"Nose is light and faintly floral before turning vegetal with hay and fresh-turned soil. Maybe fresh grass clippings? Just the slightest whiff of peat smoke underlying the whole thing.  Understated certainly; almost too much so for my preference.  Palate is very smooth with a creaminess bordering on oily.  Trademark Bowmore hay/grass/peat combo, but just a bit more restrained than in the older vintages.  A hint almost of rum (coconut and sugar?) followed by mild herbaceous flavors, mostly sage, mint and basil, almost like an American rye, to be closed out with smoke, ash and, finally, a sweet peatiness. This is clearly younger than the other Bowmore offerings, and in this case it's not a bad thing. Bowmore for me borders on too refined, too smooth, and this has enough youthful exuberance in it that you'll never forget you're drinking Scotch, yet you won't also feel like you just put out a campfire with your tongue.  This is now a permanent member of my liquor rack."

2.0,"In the Glass:  Light gold, apple juice. 

On the Nose:  Young.  It definitely has some of that Bowmore maritime influence to it. 

Taste:  The flavor follows the nose pretty closely, but the youth is even more apparent.  There's a slight touch of citrus rind in the mix as well. 
It quite honestly almost has a synthetic note to it, even after its had a chance to open.

There's a reason why Bowmore does 10's and 12's, and this whisky is a really good example as to why you'd be better off with those."

2.0,"The frigid temperatures continue to have me craving the smoky stuff. Picked this up to see if a quality Islay malt can be had for less than $40.

Smoke and some fruit on the nose. A hint of salt.

Full bodied mouthfeel. On the palette, there is spice and  a hint of vanilla, a hint of citrus, a hint of sea air, the key word here is ""hint."" It's all overwhelmed by an unpleasant spent charcoal smoke. Nothing like a campfire. 

Caramelized sugar on the finish but it fades into some sourness.

Just seems young and unfinished, will not re-purchase. The Glasgow blend from Great King St. is a better value at this price point."
3.0,"Just finished this bottle.  Every glass seemed to change my opinion of it.  Decent smoke, salty with a somewhat bittersweet bourbon bite on finish.  Nice when you're in the mood for peat but don't want to drink a campfire.  Definitely good value and drinkable.  Not sure I would buy again unless I realize this is as good at it gets at this affordable price point."

3.0,"Color is light golden - like an Irish whisky or a lighter bourbon. Relatively good legs, numerous. Nose is light, with definite peat notes of an Islay malt. A little of sweetness and oak as well (likely from the bourbon casks). Taste is a little harsh up front but mellows out into warm vanilla and peat notes. A little grassyness is buried deep in there as well as that bourbon sweet. Finish returns to the light smokiness."
4.0,"Wisps of campfire in the nose and finish. Cinnamon and salt on the tongue bloom into smoked honey and vanilla on the finish.

This is on the boarder of how peaty I like a whiskey to be, but it’s matched by the backend which is sweet and smooth. (The 12 year bowmore is still my preference, Judith prefers the cask).  O’Neill’s calls this Bowmore Cask on their menu."

4.0,"This is like the little brother of the Ardbeg 10, that is, what I imagine Ardbeg might taste like if it were released young.
    The nose is coal-smoked golden delicious apples.
    The palate follows with crisp and grilled apples, grilled with herbs spices: oregano, salt, pepper, and vietnamese cinnamon, and a burnt pecanwood closing tone.
    The finish is a lingering charred wood and burnt sugar under a blanket of warm pepper sauce.
After a bit of air time, the oiliness of the texture increases, the edges of the spice and charred wood are smoothed out and better coalesced with the herb, spice, malt, and smoke."

Nose of light honey, fruit, spice, very slight peat. The palate is a little confused. Maybe because I’m wanting the 12 experience, but it’s very pleasant. Like the nose but with some heat, but not an alcohol heat. It’s not bitter. Sweet with a salty spicy short to medium finish. Price is great too."

3.0,"A pleasant surprise. Nose is easily appreciable with a medium amount of delicious peat (more island-style, e.g. twiggy smoldering cedar vs. lit swamp gas). Also a little vegetal note like roasted brussel sprouts. Palate shows crisp and fruity before dousing you with a lash of salt spray, somewhat ragged and incoherent. Finish is intense, hot and to the point (short), although a sweet charcoal note stays to console you. Reminds me of the blend Black Bottle. Sample graciously supplied by my good friend Rob, his contribution to our last whisky tasting. Dry glass: beach bonfire."
