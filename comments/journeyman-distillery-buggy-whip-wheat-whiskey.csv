4.0,"Picked this up at the distillery yesterday. Fantastic people that are very friendly. 

Little nose but maybe light cereal. Nice light amber color. Coating, buttery mouthfeel with nice sweetness. Burn in the middle with a warm finish that slowly tapers off. A satisfying sipper for this novice whiskey drinker.

3.5,Cereal grain on the nose and palette.  A slight toffee and caramel.  Grain is less noticeable with a drop of distilled water.  Easy.  Very little burn.  Decent.

4.0,I swear these guys got their hands on a barrel of W. L. Weller Special Reserve because it's spot on to that profile
4.0,Spicy. Easy to sip

Definitely tastes spicy; however shockingly SWEET. Not like a usual sweetness in bourbon. Possibly trending more towards honey than caramel. 
Adding water changes the sweetness to more of a caramel. And, enjoyably, does not create a Scotchy/peaty taste."

4.0,This distillery really excels at making high quality yet affordable whiskeys. This definitely fits the bill. It’s simple but incredibly satisfying. There are caramel notes throughout with a mild minty taste and feel on the backend.

4.0,"Delicious Bourbon! Would probably give 4.5 stars if possible - would buy and order at every possibility. 

***edit: upon second tasting I still like the whiskey (and have admittedly had a lot to drink beforehand) but it doesn’t have as much of an impact as the first tasting. Maybe closer to a 3.5/3.75"
