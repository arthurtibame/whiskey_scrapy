3.75,"Interesting. Love the French Oak influence...vanilla creme brulee, candy floss thing going on. Quite unique. I've had a few of these distilleries offerings now and it's been not a bad hit rate 2 out of 3. Not sure if I'd drink a lot of it as it's on the sweeter side but still has unique character. 3.75"
