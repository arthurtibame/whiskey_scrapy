3.0,Sweet notes on nose on top of light heat and scent of red wine. Flavor is minimal with oak flavor but does open up a bit with ice. Good as a mixer.

3.0,"3 Stars - Enjoyable, but a bit more bite than flavor. Flavor eventually builds... but a little too hot."

4.0,Definitely a little sweet to the taste reminding me of Angel's Envy.  A bit surprised at the expert rating because I like it more than most others in my collection.

4.0,Vanilla nose.  Stats or sweet.  Long fruity finish with a bit of a nice burn and spice.  Overall smooth.
2.0,Not a fan. I could really taste  corn tone that I despise. It does have a decent spice but all in all I am  disappointed. I will reserve this bottle for guest that don't know better or aren't picky

2.0,"very little on the nose.  I tasted with a splash of water and was fairly unimpressed.  it had some toasted oak notes on the front end, but nothing lingering after that.  kinda fits the political name - long on promise and short on delivery."

3.75,Definitely different than the rye and not as sweet but a good kick and taste of pumpernickel.
