Yes there are Laphroaigs that are more complex, refined , softer and better because of age but if you want to get the taste and feel of the legendary distillery for under 80$ this is a must have and I always have this on hand."

4.0,"When first opening the bottle; dark fruits, peat and oak are predominant on the nose which create a very inviting dram. On the pallet the nose is to be found, but it shows it’s youth with a ethanol/spicy burn. While not off-putting or mellow the dark fruits are a substitute for a well aged whisky making it a rounded in your face scotch. During the last third of the bottle the fruits lessen and make way to mellow oak taste featuring; honey, butterscotch, allspice, Demerara sugar with a bitter after taste. However this is overplayed with peat which lessens the abrupt bitter end. Over all a great offering from Laphroaig that highlights dark fruits over smoothness."

Taste: smoke dominates with the peat following shortly after. Barrel spicyness dominates the mid pallet with an almost black pepper taste. Finishes very oily with a creamy/salted caramel. Laphroaig has yet again impressed me beyond belief. Extremely well done."

Taste: exceptionally smooth for its strength! Sweet, peaty, sourish, white chocolate, pastry. Very gentle when diluted: becomes more woody, grassy. 
Finish: fiery and peaty! Leaves you craving for more. 
Overall: jokes aside, one of the best drams I've ever had. They claim ""The most richly flavoured of all Scotch whiskies"" - I say, one of the most. And, at the same time, exceptionally well-balanced."

4.0,"Nose: Smoke. No surprise here. The peat is different from other Islays though. I read someone describing Ardbeg peat like a campfire and Laphroaig peat as a car fire and I agree - there is an industrial tone to the Laphroaig smoke. (I suppose this is what folks relate to as ”medicinal”? Or is that the brine?) Like it though, gives ton of character. There’s also briney notes and tar ofc. All is covered in a thick sweetness. 
Palate: Thick and oily, intense, massive peat fighting the sweetness in a balanced battle. Again sea-notes (or ”boat”-notes rather?) like tar, slight saltiness and (burning) seaweed. Hints of black pepper. 
Finish: Long and thick. Like an ocean oil spil. Nice. 
Overall: The one drawback with this one is that the key flavours are so strong that they seem to overpower many of the small nuances of the whisky, the result of which is that it comes through as slightly flat. It’s a rough one. I score it a solid 4.0 though, driven by its knock-out qualities."

Nose: pleasantly peaty. Not too much peat, just right for me.  Slight vanilla as well. Iodine. 

Taste: peat.  Very oily.  Not smooth, has some fire like young bourbon (makes sense, as it is a blend of 5-11 year old whiskey).  A bit creamy. 

Overall, it's a pleasant peated whiskey.  Not sure if I would buy it, though

Nose. Incredible vanilla and berries flavour hits you immediately. Strongly influenced by the smaller barrel used to making this. Obviously a huge plus imparting strong, lasting impression. Moderately mild fieriness.

This is less distinctive, and I personally prefer the classic 10 peatiness.

Palate: Brine, ash, some peat.  Oak, vanilla, and brown sugar.  Oily and coating.  Mint, peppermint, menthol.  Citrus oil.  Banana bread with walnuts and icing.

Other notes: The increased oak influence brings in some characteristics you might find more often in Bourbon - almost like an Islay meets Kentucky kind of thing.  My palate is a little shot for this tasting, hence the brief notes.  That being said, I have an appreciation for this one, even if it's a little odd.  I think it's a great way to showcase what oak brings to the party.

As per usual, I'm trying my best to rate this objectively, rather than subjectively."

3.75,"Early on in my whiskey journey I was out at a bar with some friends, spotted a bottle of Laphroaig 10 on the shelf that looked neglected, and asked for a pour. I was relatively new to peat at the time, and I don’t think I was ready for what ensued. Since then I’ve avoided Laphroaig but grown to love peat (Talisker, Lagavulin, Ardbeg, etc.). So many folks here and on the YouTubes have sung the praises of the QC that I thought I’d give it a go. You’ll be relieved to know that I no longer fear the Laphroaig. 

Nose comes bellowing at you out of the glass. Can’t say that I’ll ever get accustomed to the medicinal/iodine note found in younger Laphroaig, but further visits into the glass reveal the oak influence, with bready vanilla notes. Also a bit of citrus (sour, not sweet).

The taste hits you like a wave on the beach! Salty sea spray, ashy smoke, and peat peat peat! Repeated tastings bring out more vanillas and custard-like flavors. There’s the malt. It was there all along!

The finish is very interesting here. For me it’s a tad too dry. It almost felt like smoking a cigar, with more of an ashy dryness than campfire smoke. The finish does linger quite some time, and warms all the way down in a similar manor to a Kentucky hug. A fine dram, and I look forward to further exploring my bottle. Cheers!"

4.5,"Peatheads rejoice! This is a delicious smoky delight. Poured neat, nose is bbq smoker and pancake batter with malty vanilla and menthol. Palate is more of the same with the smoke taking center stage supported by some spicy heat and glazed doughnut roasting on wood fire embers with barrel notes lurking. Finish is Islay long with slow fade of malty sweet smoke and oak riding off into the sunset. Yes this is damn good scotch!. Carries a sizzle like some non age peaters but its better than the 10yr imo with additional bursting flavor from the smaller casks and a sweeter less briny edge to it. Safe to say someone who likes peated scotch will be on board with this. Even safer to say a Laphroaig fan will LOVE this scotch...........95/100"

4.5,"Smoking a pipe by a dying fire in shack on a cliff by the water on a cold night.

First impression is strong medicinal, like what I imagine a strong medicine would smell like in the 1800’s. Also hints of pipe tobacco, some brine, leather, and a little bit of vanilla in the background.

The first sip hits you with the same medicinal peat, but it isn’t harsh at all. Most definitely strong, almost overwhelming, but extremely smooth, and much sweeter than I was expecting. For 48%, it’s uncomfortably easy to drink. This is a scotch that makes me feel like an manly old timer scotch drinker. 

As you continue sips, the peat opens up into really nice old leather and pipe tobacco. Also some distinct numbing on my lips and tip of my tongue, most likely due to the abv. 

The finish is nice and long, carrying most of the tobacco flavor. The biggest thing for me is that each sip rates better than last. The finish settles down and leaves me craving more. 

This is my favorite scotch to date (6ish bottles, but mostly cheap anyway). What I like most about this scotch is that while it has that peaty, Britney, slightly harsh coastal taste, it is still warming and inviting. This bottle also has the honor of being the first in my Rotation™️. I haven’t tried the 10yo yet, but from what I’ve read they are relatively similar so maybe that one will be better, but we will see when I finish this bottle.

My last note: I sat down, wrote this tasting while drinking significantly more of my pour without even noticing, and got way more of a buzz than I was trying to get. This is a dangerous scotch, but in a great way."

After sniffing for 10-15 seconds some sweet came through, but it was a battle vs the smoke. Reminiscent of a ripe banana bread. 
First taste is a wash of peat and young oak. Very little spice considering it’s 48%. Despite how smooth it was, I added some water and a floral and tobacco profile emerged. 
This feels and tastes like a fantastic scotch with real complexity. If you like smoke, peat, and oak this scotch will delight you. It’s a great contrast to the laphroaig 10 and really provides depth for a tasting."

I love the smoky texture of your Islay standard-bearers (Lagavulin, Ardbeg, Talisker, etc.), but the extra burst of flavor in this bottle is notable and a welcome surprise. The peat smoke is what sticks with you at the end, but the flavor explosion on first sip is both surprising and pleasant.

I got this for about $10 more than the standard Laphroaig, and it's definitely worth the extra cash. Very happy with this Scotch."

4.5,"Nose is smoky firework remnants. Fusel ethanol burn, gasoline but also a medicinal plastic. Just a hint of royal blue ink from a ball-point pen.

Taste is Cigarette ash, cigar box, sandalwood, all the finest woods and spent tobacco. Cinnamon and clove on the back end, spicy. It contains the Platonic ideal of what peat should be. 

The finish is the taste you get in your mouth after the grand finale on the Fourth of July. (We will someday tell kids what that was.) The whole operation is just a muddy, smoky mess and I am loving every damn sip of it."

4.0,"The nose has a wet-campfire character like the 10 year without  the medicinal notes. As I acclimate to the impact of the peat, vanilla completely dominates the nose. Milk chocolate on the palate with subdued pepperiness and lemon if you really look for it. The finish is where this whisky shines. After an initial burst of barrel bitterness, flourishes of orange-peel and cocoa soon subside to semi-sweet vanilla latte."

4.0,"Nose is great, vanilla, smoke, salty sweetness. 

On the palate, initially I was a bit let down from how sweet it was on the nose. But the longer it’s sat in my glass the better it’s gotten. Huge smoke and spice hit. Spicier than it is Smokey though which sort of softens the sweetness of the vanilla. 

The finish is what this dram is all about! Very long lingering spice, salty and still the hint of sweetness that you long in a whisky. It’s a delightful sipper as that Smokey spice just keeps about the mouth long after the liquid has been downed."

5.0,"Laphroaig QC is very similar to Lap 10, but the flavor is even fuller and brighter. 

The first aroma on the nose is the unmistakable scent of seawater and iodine. If you venture beyond that you’ll find more delicate scents like flowers, campfire, leather, rubber-bands, and salted caramel. A few drops of water bring out even more floral aromas. 

Being 5% more ABV, the palate feels much stronger than Lap 10, and is dominated by heavy toffee, caramel, and black licorice. It is much sweeter than the nose leads you to believe. 

As the sweet toffee flavors fade, strong brine and seaweed come forward and dominate the robust oily finish. You can feel the warming sensation as the liquid pours down to your stomach. The final flavor after the brine is lighter and floral, leaving you wanting another sip. 

I think this scotch is a great bargain, considering the closest thing to it that I’ve tried is Lagavulin 16, which is over $30 more expensive. I consider these two to be  the best peated whiskies available through normal distribution."

3.75,"My favorite (thus far) of the Laphroaig line. There's a definite burn and maturity to this drink. It's got a sweetness to it, with hints of vanilla, but thats buried deep under the boldness and smoke. It's not quite as full or filling as the 10 year, and goes down a bit smoother. Intense, mature and masculine, with a solid finish."

3.75,"Picked up another Laphroiag expression which I’ve found to be my favorite distillery this far.

initially on my first pour of the neck, I could not smell much or taste much but poured a second glass and was able to identify flavors and smells. 

Nose: peat smoke is what greets you at the door, not as hard a knock though as the original 10. This is less funky with less beach day smells. But you can tell it was out there with it’s feet in the water. In less than a blink, those smells disappear and you’re greeted with a nice sweet vanilla toffee note. Could be nutter butter. 

Palate:the palate is opposite of the nose, you get the sweet vanilla flavor up front that’s like a burnt flake of the top of creme brûlée. That is quickly followed by the wood oak flavor which is expected since its the quarter cask. The wood flavor leaves you with the flavor of burnt matches if you’ve ever lit and blew out a match, the flavor is exactly how the leftover smoke would taste if you got a whiff of it.

Mouthfeel: the dram is a little oily but smooth headed down the back of the throat, it leaves your tongue a little numb with heat pooling at the back. After quite a bit of time the heat is still present in the throat."

3.0,"This NAS is a strange hybrid, it tastes like a young spirit, but has such a huge sweet peat smoke hit from the added wood contact of the smaller barrel, it really adds to its character.

There’s still the medicinal TCP flavour that is so typical of Laphroaig, but it’s hidden behind the initial sweetness and the almost overpowering peat smoke.

The medium finish emphasises the sweet fruitiness with more than a hint of chilli, but every breath out is just peat smoke all the way.

Overall, this is a little too overpowering to be an easy dram to love, added to the young spirit it’s definitely not the best in the Laphroaig line up.

I tend not to drink my bottle as a straight dram, but it’s a regular addition to my cabinet for one of my absolute favourite cocktails, the ‘For Medicinal Purposes Only’:

Absinthe wash the glass
1x Laphroaig Quarter Cask
1x Laphroaig 10 year old
1/2x Campari (hopped if you can find it)
Stir in the glass with a load of ice

Tasty as hell!"
3.5,Has that peaty scent but not as much as the original laphroaig. Smoother as well.
4.5,"All laphroaig are good. Having said that, i find this one too much alike the 10yo. It has higher abv and should have improved the taste but as i said before is almost the mirror of the 10yo. 

On the nose: Islay lovely peat, English sauce, Herbal, Oregano, Salt and a Typical laphroaig note: fresh can of tenis balls.

On the palate is a more refined laphroaig, Oranges, Pepper, Some tofee in it and a dim Peat note. Finish is short and salty.

Overall this is a very good dram but could be better. 91 over 100 is a solid score for this one."

4.0,"A nice smoky nose with scents off old wood and some cinnamon. The palate is full and almost chewy in a way. A hit of smoke but nothing extreme followed by some toffee, tobacco, and dark chocolate. The finish is sweet with some lingering smoke but it fades rather quickly to me. Overall a will balanced dram that doesn't make a fuss about it's higher alcohol content. Very good and on the same level as the Ardbeg 10, though they get there a bit differently. The Quarter Cask takes a smoother, though perhaps a bit less interesting, road to my shelf."
5.0,First taste.
4.25,"My brother and I strategically picked up this bottle on April 30, the day before the price jumped $15 to $75 MSRP in NC. The price hikes for Laphroaig were disheartening, but at least Ardbeg and Bruichladdich haven't changed for now.

The nose is strong with peat, oak, brine, and charcoal grill. It smells wonderful. I believe the second maturation in small casks adds a lot of oak flavor that overtakes some of the traditional medicinal Laphroaig qualities. Not that I mind at all.

The peat is actually muted when it hits the tongue. I mainly taste oak and some brine. Then the peat hits on the finish. It is long, oily, and bursts with charcoal flavor. I can finally taste the malt on the back end, and maybe a little dark fruit, apricot, and chocolate.

This is my kind of Islay whiskey, heavy on the peat and oak influence. A must try if you like Islay, even with the price hike in the U.S."

4.25,"I've tried Laphroaig Cairdeas triple wood cask strength and Laphroaig 10 year, this quarter cask is by far the friendliest Laphroaig I've had. Your typical nose for an Islay, with the taste starting of with a briny, sea salty, sweetness, that turns into smoke once you swallow. However that campfire taste is a bit muted, imagine not standing in front of a fire, but having that fire in the background somewhere, that's the sort of the finish you have with this Scotch. At 48% alcohol I thought it would be more challenging, but it comes of very smooth in the end."

3.75,"I like the peaty, smoky flavor."
3.75,"Nose: Peat, tar and iodine. also green apple, ginger and slightly overripe pineapple.
Taste: Peat, vanilla and oak. Very oily, with lime and orange peel. Creamy. 
Finish: very long, with dark chocolate and peat lingering on your tongue and back of your throat. 
Adding some drops of water really opens up this whisky. it tones down the smoke and peat, and brings forth more sweet fruity notes of the lime and orange, and the vanilla also really gets a boost."
2.25,"Near the bottom of the bottle I decided to do another write up of this with added water. About 6 💧 water. Initial rating was a 3.75

Nose: interestingly enough the ethanol is what greets you first. I didn’t get that on my first write up. It’s got this funk up front as well, think soy sauce. Some citrus zest in some quick sniffs. The peat is faint and is masked by the funk.

Palate: the wood oak is what comes out stronger in my opinion. Whatever sweet vanilla flavors I tasted in my earlier tasting seems to have disappeared. You get a lot of spice and ashy flavors. There’s also a salty finish to the dram. It tastes like barbecue that was over salted and burned. 

Mouthfeel: it’s heat and bitter and heat some more. It doesn’t feel as oily with water, but gives it this thick chewy quality to it. Consistency of cough syrup. It’s also dry going down, I feel like I’m getting sick/ sore throat drinking it.

Overall I did not like that experience at all. I won’t be adding water to this again. It’s good as is because you get a tinge of sweetness. The water kills that and leaves you feeling like you placed a burnt charcoal with bbq drippings in your mouth."
