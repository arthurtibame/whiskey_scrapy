5.0,"Very subly, very sweet, soft and elegant like white wine, but oily and full with a sweet madeira touch. Many don't like this whisky, but I love it."
4.0,"Smell and taste like Calvados on Pancakes. 
However, if Elven dwellings would exist, this could be how they smell. 
Carmel. Grass- wood. Vanilla, violets. Nicely burning in the throat.  Excellent."

null,"Be ye warned: this note is NOT for this bottle. Rather, it's for Penderyn's Bryn Terfel whisky from their Icons of Wales series. As opposed to their Ikons of Whales, which is just fishy orthodoxy. At any rate, the booze. If a dram could be described as both light and full, this would be one such whisky - light in color and in body, but the flavor profile is round, rich, and tastes somewhat overwhelmingly of banana and marshmallow. Add nuts and chocolate and you could have a banana split. The marshmallow note stayed around for a while on the finish. Until Distiller adds this bottling and I can migrate the review over the the proper whisky, I'll refrain from entering a rating, but I'd call it 3 stars."

2.25,"Nose - Fresh green apples, fresh sweet cream, hint of young ethanol in the background

Taste - More creamy fresh green apple cream, bitterness of young/unripe green apples are there, no burn

Finish - Creamy green apple, like over steeped green tea with dried apple peels with a hint of sweet cream added afterwards

Score - 67/100

Final Thoughts - So I'm not entirely sure how this expression differs from Penderyn Myth, but this seriously feels like it was a green tea with green apple peels in it, that was over steeped and then instead of served as is, they added a hint of sweet cream to it. It helped tame the bitterness a bit, but otherwise not much different from the Myth expression.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.5,"The spirit is so bright and crisp.  It's very citrusy with layers of cereal notes from the barley.  When I drink this, it seems thin, but it has several distinct layers.  I get a thin layer of lemony notes, a thin layer of grassy cereal notes, a thin layer of starchy cereal notes, then a thin layer of caramel notes.  It makes for an interesting drinking experience.

The Madeira cask finish is distinctive and interesting.

I like this whiskey chiefly because it's different- it is it's own animal.  There are whiskeys with more complexity or better balance, but this is so light,crisp, and drinkable it's easy to enjoy.

If the whiskey that I typically drink is Coke, this is more like Sprite.

I tend to think of peated scotch as a late fall/early winter drink.  This is a perfect early spring drink.

I've had a few Penderyn offerings now, and they have consistently impressed me.    I think that it has earned a place in my collection just to add contrast because it's just so different from the peat bombs or high-rye things that I usually drink.  It is so fresh and crisp that it manages to stand out to my palate which is acclimated to wrecking balls."
2.5,Pretty unremarkable. Not bad just not much flavor. The bud light of whisky

4.0,"Very rounded cake and shortbread notes. Almost with a curl of chocolate on top of cake. 

Very vanilla forward with very little spice. A bit of fresh citrus coming 
through. 

Love the rounded flavors and there is something unique on the nose but very flavorful. 

Keep getting chocolate cake! Could definitely be a daily drinker for me."
2.5,Very slight hint of vanilla

3.25,"Color is very light, pale straw. Nose is light and clean, with notes of green apple and faint banana, maybe some flashes of citrus. First sip is smooth and clean, with subtle dried fruits and vanilla flavor. As you take more sips, notes of malt and creme are noted. The finish is moderate in length, with the mild black pepper and more fruit lingering. Overall, nothing displeasing, decent finish, just maybe a little too clean, not exactly exciting."

On débute en force!
Une belle surprise pour commencer la soirée. Ce whisky onctueux coule dans notre bouche comme une douceur veloutée. Cette bouteille sera sûrement sur ma prochaine liste d'achat parce que le ratio qualité-prix est tout à fait incroyable. On aime faire de belle découverte!"

3.5,"My No. 99 review comes from a Welsh Whisky, Penderyn Legend. Not sure what to expect before tasting it, but it was fairly interesting. This young whisky, is bottled at 41%abv and has a pale gold color. On the nose is not strong, but its notes are nice. Grapes, Vanilla Cake, Raisins, artificial apple juice and some spicyness. Not to powerful, but pleasant. On the palate is very enjoyable without being fabulous. A lot of wood, new wood. There is something like raw cocoa, light bodied but mouth watering. Nice clean finish, pleasant and smooth. There is a dark chocolate note and some slight spicyness. After 10 minutes it became strangely thick, like chewable. I didn't touch it, (didn't add water at all) and it felt like bitting an orange. The Nose also evolved into milk chocolate bathed raisins. Overall is a good whisky. Easy drinkable, but there is a lot better drams out there. 3.25 out of 5. (73 out of 100"
4.0,"I really like this pot still Welsh Whisky. I bought mine in Hawaii so it’s at the U.S. permitted 43% ABV. The Madeira cask finishing smoothly immerses this malty, fruity, and spicy oaked whisky into a medium sweet and dry finish. This is my first foray into Welsh Whisky and it has me wanting to delve deeper into this mythical land of King Arthur and dragons."

4.0,"Really interesting dram. Being new to Welsh whisky, I got a pack of three 20cl bottles of penderyn and legend is my first taste.

The nose is sweet and fruity with hints of vanilla.
The Palate is really fruity and fresh with a light Madera finish that is pleasant.
It reminds me of a speyside with less complexity"
