3.75,"For me, this one starts with a sweet, almost floral nose. The taste seems a bit thin at first, but settles in pretty quickly to give the right amount of heat with a mixture of fruitiness, wood, and a touch of spice, maybe a hint of clove. Overall, a good bourbon if you can find it for a fair price. Cheers 🥃"

4.5,"Nose is medicinal but flavor is outstandingly complex and has multiple notes of corn, peanut, caramel and vanilla. Great lasting finish. Overall great bourbon."

3.75,"My least favorite of the bunch. Not bad, but not amazing."
5.0,"Blaum Oldfangled 12 is delicious. I have a 117 proof and I know they now have 105 proof, so this review will vary from later releases. It's a butterscotch bomb in a glass - starts out spicy and hot, but in a similar way to a really good GTS where the heat adds complexity and flavor and is a welcome addition. The profile is heavy vanilla and butter, with caramel. It's the best bourbon I've ever had."
4.5,"Thick and rich. Vanilla, caramel, baking spices"
4.5,"Nose: sweet, somewhat honey like

Taste:coats the tongue well. Spice, apple/pear

Finish: long"
4.75,"Taste:  2 oz. neat in glen cairn. 105.7 proof, 12 yr 2019 Fall release

Nose (4.7)  caramel corn, bit-o-honey, and peanut brittle.  I could nose this for days.

Palate: (4.75) True caramel bomb with pecans and a bit of spice.  Reminds me of Fanny May Turtles with alcohol and just a hint of pepper.  Nice and coating.  It is what a grear bourbon should be.

Finish (4.75):  Slightest of burn.   Does not at all resemble a higher proof in that department.  Follows through with some honey and a hint of what is almost raspberry fruit.  Only regret is that it could have been longer.  Don't blame the bourbon that is me just not wanting it to end.

Overall:  Was really debating the hype.  After all,  this is a sourced distillate and very admittedly is ""not our bourbon"" when it comes to the distiller's claim.  But it IS an incredibly well aged, 12 yr old MGP cask bourbon with all the right moves.  It is everything you want in a classic bourbon-  bold caramels and vanilla, some fruits, spice, oak, and pecan nuttiness.  Worth the hype?  Glad I have it in my collection"

4.5,"Neat.  Blast of honey, corn, and baking spices off the bat.  Deep, rich and mostly dark nose.  Some vanilla and raspberries emerge.  Butterscotch.  

Nice, oily texture on the tongue.  Vanilla and raspberries upfront, hint of that honey in the sweetness but transitions to dark, tannic quickly.  Those raspberries come blasting through with another wave of vanilla and transitions back to those dark notes.  Oak, chocolate finish.  

Quintessential MGP with a few surprises like those raspberries."

4.75,"Have 110 bottle. Full, rich flavor. Smooth all the way through. Trumps GTS by a lot"
4.25,"Tasting the 106.6 proof batch from 2019.

This is yet another hyped NDP that sources well aged Bourbon from MGP and releases it at cask strength without filtration. Like all the other NDP that source and release MGP double digit age statement Bourbon at Cask Strength these are sought after and resell on the secondary market for 2 to 3 times retail! Blaum Bros is regarded as one of the better barrel selectors (in my opinion Smokewagon are the best at the moment) so this one is definitely a hyped bottle. Before we get to the review let's examine what's in the bottle:

Source: MGP
Age: 12yrs
Proof: 106.6
Filtration: Unfiltered
Mashbill: Undisclosed (21% Rye based on taste)

How does it taste? Let's dive in...

It enters rich and viscous... Oily mouthfeel with rye spice immediately evident layered with dark chocolate dipped in vanilla extract... Lovely entry and quintessential MGP.... Mid palate adds oak, caramel and tobacco... Finish is long with wood spice, clove and cocoa... Lovely! 

In summation this is another wonderful MGP expression! Blaum Bros picked some great barrels for this batch! It's worth retail but don't pay over the odds. Pro tip, buy the Redemption 9yr High Rye Bourbon.... Cheers!"
4.25,105.7. Brown sugar. Rye spice. Cinnamon. Oak. Medium body with medium finish. Not overly hot. Slightly tangy which kept this from a 4.5
4.25,"117.2 proof

Nose- Caramel corn, butterscotch, rye spices, cocoa powder, cherry 

Palate- Rye spices initially, leather, caramel corn, powdered sugar, cherries

Finish- Medium, spicy finish with notes of rye spices, powdered sugar, and oak

Initially in the glass I was not impressed. But after some time to air out, this transformed into a solid whiskey. I really like the caramel corn and butterscotch on the nose, the primary smells im getting. The palate opens up with a wave of rye spice, the caramel corn returns, and some powdered sugar pops up near the end. I would expect a longer finish with such a high proof bourbon, but nonetheless, it is tasty... with oak, rye spices, and powdered sugar rounding it out. For $400 this is a hard pass for me. I would drink it at a bar for the right price, but I would pass on a bottle."
4.25,105.7 batch. Neat. Nose is sweet caramel butterscotch spice. Taste is sweet spicy red hots candy with a spicy cinnamon baked apple finish. Pretty tasty.

4.75,Great proof point with an after taste that reminds me of Stagg Jr after drinking for a bit. Nutty nose and good overall pour
