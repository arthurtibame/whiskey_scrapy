4.0,"For the price point, this is a very good whiskey. The batches are small, made with all Colorado ingredients, and then aged until it gets a beautiful amber color and mellows leaving only a hint of a burn. Rich caramel flavor mixes well with the charred oak and a sweetness that is noticeable but not as cloying as you may expect from a corn whiskey. Mixes well but is best enjoyed neat or with a few drops of water."
