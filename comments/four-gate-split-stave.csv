4.5,"So good… so good. Four Gate Whiskey Batch 4 – (Split Stave By Kelvin) carries a deep heavy complex profile that’s tasty and rich yet restrained and balanced. It’s not a wild whiskey but rather heavy and elegant. Water opens up some biscuity, cocoa powder and peanut notes on the Nose. On the Palate it opens up to more dark fruit and introduces some leather, citrus, nuts and hints of baked apples."
5.0,"Neat.  Neck pour.  The nose is very nice.  More subtle than I was expecting but patience opened it up.  This experiment with the barrels is so interesting.  It feels like I am simultaneously smelling the different staves and the different ages.  Deep Oak comes through accompanied by a brightness I associate with younger whiskey.  That deep oak comes through as both charred and a hint of the marshmallow note I associated with toasted barrels.  Caramels, vanilla, coconut, peanut shells, and berries are coming through hard now.  The more time I spend with this the more the volume of all the flavors on the nose are turning up.  I could go at this one all day.

Super creamy and thick on the tongue. Ah damn, this a top notch way to start a Friday night.  On the tongue, I get this whip cream and vanilla pudding sweetness.  On the taste it shoots darker immediately.  Peanut butter, chocolate, marshmallow.  Oak and a hint of cinnamon.  It’s like making a s’mores with a peanut butter cup rather than just Hershey chocolate.  The flavors last quite a while.  The legs don’t bring additional flavors or change.  It’s more like a song that tails off slowly turning down the volume.  The peanut butter comes through more and more as time goes on.  I’d even call it a creamy buckeye now.  

Such a good pour.  I don’t recall a whiskey that I wanted to describe in such conflicting ways simultaneously.  I just thought to myself “subtle flavor bomb.”  How can a flavor bomb be subtle?  Very nice job on this Four Gate."
