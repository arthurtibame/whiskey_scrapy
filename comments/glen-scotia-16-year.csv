4.25,"Campbeltown whisky, where scottish whisky was born. Only three distilleries are working there nowadays, and i got to say that i haven't tried much from this region, but every time i had one it has been great. This was no exception. A beautiful dram, very balanced and well crafted.

Bottled at 46%abv.

On the nose it is where things are a little weak. Lemon, Peat, Burnt hay, Prunes, Grapefeuit. Its a citric rare whisky, Very acetonic.

On the palate, the rollercoaster of great flavors start. Ashy, Super fresh; Citric and Balanced.

Aftertaste is mildly Peated, some notes of Prunes and ""Ashy citric cigarretes"". Amazing really.

Overall if you want an interesting dram that gives you peatiness and fruitiness, with enough flavor and capability to surprise you, this is a good option. 89 over 100."
