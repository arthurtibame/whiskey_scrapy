4.5,"Awesome, heartwarming rye. Color is a beautiful dark brown, huge spice profile; a lot of cinnamon, clove. Bit of ethanol on the nose, but with previous acts of MWND, I have found this dissipates with age and it just continues to get better each month after opening"
4.25,Deep amber color. Maple and Molasses nose with an acetone Finnish. Brown sugar with a light rye spice taste. Not super hot. Well rounded oaky whiskey

4.0,A very good rye that lingers. The port flavor comes through subtly.
4.5,"Deep rust color with a pinkish hue. Enticing fruit-forward nose with notes of apple juice, grape soda, cherry pie filling, green pears, mulling spice blend and hints of cedar. Thick, full-bodied mouthfeel. Strong port influence on the palate, with dried apricots, dark cherries, golden raisins, honey, hints of cinnamon apple pie, and peppery rye spices kicking in at the back of the palate. Long, dry finish with more black pepper and rye spice, herbal grassy notes, grape soda and a touch of oak."

5.0,Very nice. Worth grabbing if you see it. Have to edit the rating. This is amazing!
4.25,Peppery fireside goodness
3.25,"Nonexistent nose at first, slowly opens up. On the palate, the same level of interesting you would expect, but less floral and a deeper  complexity. Smooth but still spicy. The ""different"" nature of this doesn't punch you in the face like some of the other acts, but it's still there. 12/6/19"
