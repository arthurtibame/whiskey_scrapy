null,"Great, more super expensive NAS whisky being released to slowly ween consumers off age statements - it seems as if whiskey companies are working harder on marketing these days to brainwash people  using high prices, unknown recipes, FOMO, and fancy boxes. Personally - I won’t be participating in any NAS whisky above $130 whatsoever, but if someone wants to buy me a sample - I’ll try it. 😃 cheers to age statements!"
4.25,"Good sherry profile and complex, but not worth the price tag. 

4.25/5"
4.0,Rich and complex - has the premium macallan experience to it. Tried this at DFS Singapore but for the price plenty of others to pick from. Ended up picking the limited highland park 15 cask series for much less and hoping that’s going to turn out well

4.5,"Nose - Rich balanced caramely/sherry influence, juicy raisins/prunes, caramel, vanilla, hint of dark apple juice, dark dried apricots.

Taste - Bit thin initially & a bit drying, light peppery spice, dark stone fruit sweet, dark raisins, tiny hint of bitterness like the stray grape vine stems left on raisins

Finish - Lingering dark dried stone fruit sweet, but not overly or cloyingly sweet, bitterness gently fades, very long lasting finish, slightly metallic dried fruit sweetness goes in & out

Score - 89/100

Final Thoughts - Kind of hate to admit this but this is very well balanced from start to finish. Macallan knows a thing or two about a good sherry cask matured Scotch and this shows it. Nice not too cloyingly sweet sherry influence with what I kind of get to be a toasted cask where I get nice fruity caramelized sugar notes throughout without being too sweet somehow. Very easy to drink with a tiny hint of tingle on the palate. Doesn't taste young, but at the same time doesn't taste like a super aged Scotch either, so I'm sure there's some blend of young and old in this one and it's done beautifully.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not at the prices it's currently priced at"

The almond, and floral notes were suttle and the hints of ginger and pear were hidden to me until another connoisseur pointed them out. while Mcallan doesn't advertise the age of this, the sommelier assured us it was at least 18 years old."
