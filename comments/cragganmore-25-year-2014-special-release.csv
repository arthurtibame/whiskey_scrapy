4.0,"Enjoyed this expression, but came away disappointed - it may have spent too much time in cask, so that oak and wood spices overpower the other more subtle aromas. 

Heather and cinnamon on the nose, melon on the palate with strong oak and wood spices. Honey tries to make an appearance and barely succeeds. Body is surprisingly light and the finish is neither short nor lingers."
