5.0,The extra rye content in the bottle adds an lovely burst of spiciness to an already stellar whisky!

4.0,"Sweet fruit (pear, apple and plum) and smooth vanilla with a peppercorn spice finish. Bit of an alcohol heat. Paired nicely with butternut squash soup!"

3.0,"How this got an “expert” score of 92 is interesting. This is a good whiskey but not over 89 in my books. 

I’ve tested this whiskey on three different occasions when starting my binge for the night. 

Night 1: Started drinking this neat and thought it had a odd nose to it due to the double oak. I drank it nonetheless. 

Night 2: Started drinking this after half in the bag. I couldn’t notice the nose issue from Night numero uno, yet i did find more appreciation for the other characteristics of the dram. 

Night 3: Did a repeat of Night 1 and appreciated it better but couldn’t say this would be a top shelf whiskey even though i found different aspects to this drink at the beginning or mid way through two evenings.

To make a long story short - I wouldn’t purchase this one again. Worth trying as it is a good Canadian Rye but not something that tickles my fancy."

4.0,"I purchased this at the LCBO store while visiting Canada. I want to say after converting back to US dollars, it was like 30 dollars. The product delivered for 30 dollars exceeds expectations. Don't go in with unrealistic expectations but when I opened this bottle I didn't touch the rest of my collection till it was gone. I was craving canadian whiskey apparently... It's not a showpiece bottle, no one will recognize it but everyone who samples it will like it. The bottle is a good bang for the buck. When I go back to canada, I'll buy another bottle."
3.25,Nice whisky for the price. Definite oakiness and a warm burn.

4.0,"This whisky starts very sweet. In the nose and across the palate I'm certainly picking up lots of brown sugar, toasted caramel, and I guess Maple syrup. Thankfully there is at least a second or balancing note to this whisky. Rye. The spice is barely there in the nose but wakes up in the palate. A peppery, drying spice that helps cut the sweet or balance the sugar. The finish is a bit too wood, bitter, and dry for me, but it welcomes another sip!"
