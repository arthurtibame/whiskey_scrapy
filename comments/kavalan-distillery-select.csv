3.75,"This is my very first Kavalan and I decided to go with their ""budget"" offering. I say ""budget"" because with Bourbon $60 is a premium price point for sure! 
Fortunately, I was able to receive a generous pour from a vendor as part of their 4 Roses tasting without having to part with the $60 (why Kavalan was with 4 Roses I have no idea!)
On the pallette it's got a soft yet creamy entry with baking and dark chocolate immidiately evident leading to an  array of dried fruit notes (mainly golden raisins) leading to a medium finish with a burst of red licorice and more of that baking spice note. This stuff is really tasty! The best way to describe it is a better more complex Toki! 
From a value stand point would I pay $60 for it? I am on the fence since it's not my typical profile. However, if you are a big Japanese Whiskey fan then for sure this is an instant buy at $60. This really makes me curious to explore their non ""budget"" line! Cheers all!"
3.0,"Very nice nose light caramel with a touch of pepper. Taste is young, but with fine notes. Very good price quality for a daily drink or to introduce Whisky."

3.5,"You could splash this on to throw off any velociraptors trying to track you by your scent.

Smells very funky ..like very overripe fruit soaking in alcohol. It's not pleasant. The taste however evolves through a series of smoke, leather, banana/mango, honey and vanilla."

3.25,"Orange zest, honey dew and baking spices on the nose. Spicy entry on the palate with apples, honey and some woody notes. Finish is medium length, spicy and a little bitter. 
This was intended as a mixer and is best suited for that purpose. Not a sipper."

2.5,"The color is dark caramel (all natural).
The smell is sweet and at the same time pungent, of caramel, anise, plums, pineapple and a pinch of pepper. In the background, a certain hint of rubber that gradually fades but remains present.
On the palate, the fruity flavors are strengthened, remaining wrapped in caramel, with the addition of milk chocolate and a marked saline note. The flavors are a little fleeting, flicks that appear and disappear in the mouth, without much substance, quickly letting alcohol and still the gum perceived in the nose emerge.
Fairly short finish, fruity and salty with a touch of spices."
