2.0,"Like all NEW YORK distiller bourbons I have tried so far, it lacks depth and in my opinion, is very young tasting and way over priced.  There is a strong alcohol smell initially on the nose which masks all other smells.  It taste like watered down corn syrup.  Long burn. Limited flavor profile.  May be better after aged a few more years"

1.0,I get the basic cheap bourbon flavors from this. Cotton candy and bubble gum. This whisky is young and aggressive. The price does not reflect what you are getting. This is a $8-13 bottle. Not the $28 they are charging.
