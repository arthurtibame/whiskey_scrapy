3.5,"Riecht sehr ansprechend. Rauch im Geschmack genau richtig, die zitrusaromen spannend, aber insgesamt doch zu brandig."
1.25,"How do you rate a whisky when youth defines the complexity. It's an issue oddly on all my reviews tonight.

Nose - YOUNG, spices, citrus, and yes earthy. 

Taste - So this is spices, citrus, vanilla.  Then we got some oak, light earth, darker vanilla. A toasted barrel oak even. 

A really nicely made whisky, doesn't offer the value of the 12 or 18 tomatin but it's unique. Would I buy it again? no. Would I buy it again for 20 bucks? No. Am I glad to have tried it? I'm not upset. 

1.25 score - I don't get it. It's and there's quality to this, but I'd never push anyone to waste money on this one."

3.0,"Not terrible, but gimmicky and overpriced--what we have here is another maker of unpeated whiskies bottling a young, peated spirit and selling it at an inflated price. Doesn't know what it wants to be: a mish-mash of flavours, most of them too weak, that don't really cohere. Lightly smoky (think campfire smoke, not earthy, green, vegetal Islay smoke), with flavours of light orchard fruit, light berries. Vanilla, butterscotch, diacetyl (movie popcorn butter), grapefruit and citrus pith. Stomach bile. Tastes young, sour, yeasty or doughy. Light tasting, with some faint tropical fruits, peppery, floral notes (heather), and a bit of saltiness. Reminds me of a lightly smoky blend or an off-brand Highland Park."

2.0,Peaty
4.0,"I like the way the peat was barely there in both nose and taste when tried neat, but how it came through more definitively with the addition of a little water.  The peat sort of hovered there at the finish, and landed slowly with the mild alcohol burn to end the taste."

2.0,"The aroma or nose of the Scotch is wonderful. Spicy, citrus, maybe. The smoke is stronger then the peat. The mouth feel is full, but the finish is short, and firey. For me the nose is the best part. Sipping over time is not my favorite with this Tomatin."

2.5,"this scotch definitely needs to mature a bit more before making its way to the bottle.  light smoke on the nose, not much flavor, with a campfire smoke finish and a nice long burn that leaves my mouth watering.  too pricey for the quality."
