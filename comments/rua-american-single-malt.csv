4.25,"Wow - 18 months young! Rua is whiskey’s rookie of the year.
Nose: light fruit & vanilla wafer. Mix of Irish (Greenspot & RedBreast), but at the same time, completely unique.
Palette: it’s not Bourbon, it’s not quite Irish. A Bread Pudding sprinkled with a concoction of clove & wild honey
Finish: great top of mouth & lingering 20 second warmth"

3.75,"Found in Northern Virginia.  Great sipper. Wonderful color.  A keeper, smooth, nice break from bourbon."
5.0,"I want to start by saying that this is an extremely bias 5/5 score. I love the marketing, the distillery, the bottle shape, the color of the whiskey. I love everything about it not involved with the actual liquid inside. But since this is a whiskey review page, and I really like the taste as well, I will review the liquid. The nose is on the younger side, with a strong malt sourness that is surrounded by gentle, sweeter, more complex notes.  The nose presents as creamy vanilla with an overarching sweetness that lingers between caramel and granulated sugar. Hidden underneath is a pecan nuttiness. The taste adds a nice toastiness and spice that isn't on the nose but takes away some of the vanilla. The finish adds in the oak, lingering sweetness, and a cocoa powder dryness (that reminds me of a four roses product if that helps anyone)."
3.5,"Very good stuff! Tried it for the first time at a bar in Charlotte and then walked a mile to the nearest liquor store to buy a bottle to bring home. I was on a work trip, don’t judge me!!"

5.0,"RÚA Release 10 Batch 18

Tried neat in a Glencarin rested for 5 minutes.

Color: Reddish gold

Nose: Cherry is the dominate player, a bit of wood, malty sweetness, touch of light sweet cinnamon, and a bit of a doughy note.

Pallet: Sweet, malty, cherry carries though, oak spice, raisin, slightly drying, chocolate in the back, and burned sugar.

Finish: A burst of maraschino cherry, dark chocolate, and a touch of cinnamon.

Nose 2: A chocolate note really comes forward after drinking it giving the nose a chocolate cordial cherry smell.

RÚA Release 12, Batch 22

Tried neat in a small brandy glass rested for 5 mins

Color: Reddish gold

Nose: Cherry and apple cider, herbal tea with lemon zest, earthy chocolate notes, a faint spice that tickles the back of the throat, and a touch of toasted sugar and oak.

Pallet: sweet apple, lemon tea, chocolate, hardly any spice, touch of oak, watery.

Finish: Lemon carries over, touch of toasted oak, a sweetness sticks to the side of the cheeks. Medium/Long finish."
4.0,Good Charlotte whiskey
5.0,"Decided to take a break from the bourbon and try this American Single Malt that was recently named Gun & Garden magazine 2016 ""Best Drink in the South"". Tried neat in a glencairn the color is as the name would suggest, light red. On the nose the first thing that jumped out was tea. Just made, still warm sweet tea. That is followed by wood, green apple, smoke, and a nice old waxed leather note. It enters honey sweet. A big hit of malty grain with tea (there it is again) and cigar smoke. You can tell this is young, but it is complex and tasty. Nice clingy substantial mouthfeel. Finishes smooth with a light tingling that coats the palate, leaving toasted marshmallow and tea (again) to linger. A splash or a cube of ice adds a malty chocolate note. I really enjoyed this. Almost poetic that a southern whiskey would remind me of sweet iced tea. Sometimes outside the box is just what the Doctor ordered. 4 1/2 stars, but I'll round up. Release 10/Batch 18"

5.0,"So, there should be more discussion of the American Single Malt genres as a whole, but that’s a rant for later. RUA is an Irish Single Malt philosophy applied to American whiskey. This whiskey is leading the way in the American Single Malt genre that is yet to be defined in many ways. Long flavors, that slowly build into rich spicy notes, much like an old fashioned in a bottle. The taxon of American Single malt is the new frontier of American whiskey, and Oliver Mulligan is making amazing stuff in Charlotte North Carolina. It’s very different from Bourbons. Rye drinkers and cocktail nerds will enjoy this."
5.0,"First off half these folks dont what the fuck they’re talking about. This amazing 3 year whiskey, that thinks you might walk down the scotch path but you end up giving high fives to the bourbon crew you brought with you. This is an impressive single malt U.S. whiskey that dances down your tongue as you marvel how it’s possible that only 3 years can change the value of this lovely flavor. Nicely done Ollie!"
4.0,Slightly on the sweeter side but incredibly smooth and complex for a craft whiskey. Excellent and highly recommended. One of the best American single malts in an international style.
3.25,"On the nose, citrus fruit and acidic. On the palate, vanilla gives way to salted nuts covered in melted caramel. A surprising amount of texture and complexity for such a young whiskey"

3.0,"N: scotch, bread
P: Sweet, with more bread. Rye-like spice, which is interesting given the 100% barley mashbill. Lemon
F: lingering spice, and pleasant burn 

0-1.5: Disgusting. Worth only mixing or          meeting the drain. 
2: Bad. Drinkable, but majorly flawed 
2.5: Sub-par. OK, but bland or somewhat flawed. 
3: Good. Decent stuff, but I won’t be rushing to buy it 
3.5: Very good. I’d love to keep a bottle around
4: Excellent. I would like to own a case. A go to for me that is worthy of celebrating 
4.5: Incredible.Truly high end, elite level, very noteworthy
5: Sublime. Nearly perfect and an all time favorite"

4.5,"This one is now being bottled at 46%ABV. I still get the sweet iced tea note. The green apple, cereal grains, toasted marshmallow and cigar smoke are there as well. The newer releases also sport a healthy dose of cinnamon. The clingy finish is a few degrees warmer thanks to the added proof, but if that bothers you a splash will tone it down. This is one of my favorite craft whiskies. Mostly available in NC, but has been branching out into other parts of the Southeast. If you see it, give it a try."

Some peat , spicy, 

Like as a single malt"
4.0,"Rich, lush with hints of spice.  Delicious!"
3.75,"On the nose it has hints of oak, cherries, and tea. 
It has a sweet vanilla flavor with a close kinship to bourbon. This is a young single malt and I would love to see how it would taste if it was aged to at least 12 years."

3.25,"Am in Charlotte NC on Business and have heard good things about this one so decided to give it a try. The bottle I tried was age stated at 2 yrs old. So this is for sure some young Distillate. On to the tasting.
On the pallette it's pretty smooth and light entry. Oak is present right away with some honey, vanilla and clove. Malt comes out in the mid pallette with a slight tobacco note and more oak on a shortish finish. 
All in all this is a pretty tasty pour. It's better than most American single malts I have had and honestly I would drink this over Stranahans. If you are visiting the CLT area, look this up for sure. Cheers all!"

4.0,"Whiskey extravaganza #6

I just opened this bottle and have only had 2 drams so I need to give it more time but I can say that this is a rich and flavorful American single malt. It’s currently tasting like a bourbon/scotch hybrid, which is unexpected and delicious. Looking forward to seeing how it evolves over time. Thanks for the rec @dubz480! And @PBMichiganWolverine I’ll pull your sample over Labor Day weekend."

null,"Absolutely incredible for the age. This bottle is jam packed with flavor and complexity. It’s very sweet, viscous, and the abv is just perfect- the sweet potato thing is there but is subtle and warranted, it’s only 1 part in about 8 different notes that I pick up on. Well worth the price. Fantastic."

3.75,You know what? This is yummy and rich but I can see how you could get tired of it quickly. I called it the “Thanksgiving Whiskey” because I caught notes of cinnamon and sweet potato.

3.5,"This is a tasting of batch 51.  I had previously had a couple bottles of batch 18 that impressed me...but it’s been a while.  This bottle is good, but not quite as good as I remember the batch 18 bottles being.  Still, for a whiskey aged a mere 16 months, it’s not bad.  Very much a sweet grain and vanilla aroma and flavor, reminiscent of Irish whiskey, but a bit yeastier.  Considering that Great Wagon Road Distilling has only been around since 2013, I’d say they’re off to a great start, considerably better than any other young craft whiskey I’ve had.  I look forward to the day they are able to release a bottle that’s been aged for years instead of months."

4.0,"As a native North Carolinian, I'm proud of our excellent beer and sometimes excellent wine, but in my experience our whiskey falls far short of nearby states. In the past I've only had Defiant and TOPO whiskeys, both rapid-aged whiskey in stainless steel barrels. Defiant is average and overpriced for what it is, TOPO is terrible and severely overpriced. It pains me to say that because a lot of Top of the Hill staff played on and sponsored my soccer team. Their vodka and gin is alright! Anyways, a lot of NC distilleries are young which means their whiskey is either sourced or very young. In general they aren't reviewed well and seem overpriced, so I avoided trying any of these newer distilleries in recent years, until now. Rua has gotten so much love on here and on the Whiskey Vault, I had to buy it.

First note, Rua American Single Malt Whiskey is currently released at 92 proof so the Expert Review is out of date using the older 80 proof version. My bottle was aged for 15 months, which is remarkable for the color, nose, and taste I get. The trick is they age this whiskey in 25-gallon barrels, half the size of traditional barrels used for bourbon. The climate is also a little more humid and warmer than Kentucky. Not quite Texas heat but you should get faster aging based on my 33 years living here. 

I get sweet bread pudding or a cinnamon muffin on the nose, but it lacks the banana flavor you'll find in Brown-Foreman products. That nose carries through the taste, it is beautiful, sweet, but not overwhelming. At the moment my two closest comparisons are Woodford Reserve Double Oaked and Balcones Baby Blue, which is surprising considering this is only malted barley. This shows how much charred oak and climate contributes to flavors we may associate with corn. I know I like referencing bread pudding for some bourbons, but this may be closer with dense breakfast pastries/cakes that are heavy with cinnamon and vanilla cream. The finish is medium and the sweetness disappears quickly, which I think is a positive. I get zero alcohol burn sipping on this. For a single malt this is much closer to bourbon than Scotch. Presently, this is the best NC whiskey I've had and I'd love to try other products by Great Wagon Road. It likely requires a distillery visit since I've never seen any other product sold around Chapel Hill. 

Release #50, aged 15 months in 25-gallon barrels"

3.75,"Nose is Dark caramel and burnt sugars,   Sweet ripe fruits and barrel notes. Plums and Christmas candy. Hints of black licorice
Front is sweet and charred, some warmth mid palate.
Finishes a little Smoky, lingers with sweetness and barrel char/roasted malt. Dry grainy notes as well"
4.25,"Finished off my current bottle last night. Sweet Tea, Oak, Cigar, Vanilla and Chocolate Malt. How they make something this good with so little aging is a mystery that I wish other craft places would solve. It has to start with an awesome mash (provided by Olde Mecklenburg Brewery) and some Distilling/Barrel wizardry from Ollie at Great Wagon Road. Now, If I could only get my hands on some of the Cask Strength or Sherry Cask Finished..."
