4.0,"Man wish I would have read other review prior to getting this one and would have picked up Elijah Craig barrel proof instead after learning backstory on Templeton.  Nevertheless, owner of store kinda sold me saying it was rare and had just got case in so brought me a bottle out of the back.  It’s a very good rye and I’m not a huge rye fan.  Wouldn’t put ahead of Pikesville but definitely worth trying.  Get all the notes up front of citrus, spice, cloves.  Very unique nose, something in there I can’t “put my nose on”.  On the pallet get  cloves, burnt/ candied orange peels and a nice spicy big red,allspice, peppery finish."
4.5,"I really wanted to hate this Rye and am irritated with myself that I even bought it. The conundrum is that finding well aged barrel proof rye from MGP distillate at a price point under $100 is almost impossible. Say what you will about MGP, but they sure know how to distill some damn fine Rye. Now why do I dislike Templeton? Simple, they are one of the most dishonest purveyors of sourced Whiskey (Google Templeton controversy if you are not familiar). In addition to this on their standard releases they actually add a chemical additive to their rye which prevents then from labeling it as a straight rye (they originally did label it as one). On this limited release that additive is happily absent and it's simply their master distiller blending MGP Ryes at cask strength. Spoiler alert, it's good. Very good.
On the pallette you get all the wonderful notes you expect from the MGP honey barrels, clove, mint, orange peel and some vanilla in the background. As we move to the mid pallette you get some orchard fruits with sprinkles of black pepper leading to a long oak and butterscotch led finish. Great viscosity and it's smooth as silk. For context this one obliterates the Knob Cask limited release. It's that good. I would put this one slightly ahead of Pikesville. It's a wonderful pour. For the $59 price point, it's a solid buy. 
If you pass because you don't want to support a company like this, I fully understand and back you. If you have a weakness like I do for good quality, reasonably priced Whiskey, pick this up. It won't last long."

4.25,"Noses sharper and spicier than the 10 year, scents of a rain soaked field. The forward flavors are sharper with a peppery heat, hints of roasted corn."

5.0,Just buy this and enjoy it. You will not be disappointed. It seems that the Templeton master distillery hand picks and blends together the best barrels in their warehouse that were originally sourced from MGP . All varying ages used and a yearly release. Obviously I have done a bit of digging as I wanted to know more. One of the best Ryes I have ever had.

2.5,Not bad. Some short heat initially but sweeter as you sip. Not amazing
2.5,"nose: grass and fruit with a little bit of oak.  unfortunately I also smelled a slight bit of acetone as well

taste: grass, fruit, strong kick at the end from the high proof.  goes down smooth after that initial kick.  

finish: short finish, not as spicy as the 6 year rye. mostly spice and a little bit of oak at the end."
3.75,Has an extremely distinct pear taste that harkens to the rustic canned pears my grandmother used to preserve. Definitely 57%
