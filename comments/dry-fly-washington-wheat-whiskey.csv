3.0,"My very first impression on the nose was Twizzlers. Neat it punches above its weight class but with a splash of water, it opens and presents with maturity. 
Suddenly, the nose turns into creamy spiced cider."
3.5,"I've always had a soft spot for Spokane since visiting as a preteen on a family road trip to Yellowstone and seeing the falls on the Spokane River. Maybe it's just sentimentality, but I liked this whiskey a lot.
It needs some time in the glass to open up and let the ethanol dissipate. Once it has, the sweet wheat and caramel on the nose are inticing. The creamy palate displays more sweet wheat and caramel. It's also a little hot. The same notes appear in the medium length finish."

3.0,"A little sweeter than I expected. Caramel sweetness first on palate, followed by spice (Cinnamon/pepper), light tannin on front of mouth. Initially soft finish turns quickly to spice but didn't linger too long."

4.0,"Nose - Sweet vanilla caramel, hint of ""smarties"" candy, hint of orange zest.
Taste - Sweet vanilla, creamy caramel, light cinnamon spice tingle, hint of malt powder, latte foam sweetness.
Finish - Pleasant smooth cinnamon vanilla caramel sweetness that slowly fades.
Score - 87/100
Final Thoughts - I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It's sadly a bit one dimensional and I think it might get lost if mixed in a cocktail or over ice but it's amazingly smooth to sip neat. Flavors are a bit subtle but tasty. This might make a good mixer to something with a bit more oak or spice to tame that back a bit and add a bit of creamy caramel sweet."

3.0,"Was light in body, aroma & flavor but by no means a bad whiskey."
4.0,"Flora nose. Floral flavors extent into the tasting profile with a small spicy spike in the middle of the taste, the burn extends beyond the finish, but in a surprisingly sophisticated way. This may may be my favorite micro-distilled wheated whiskey."
2.5,"sweet and smooth on the front but there's something off-putting in the finish... I can't quite tell what it is but there's an almost chemical property that lingers.  otherwise somewhat light in flavor, color, and aroma"

3.75,"Having biked from BC down to Idaho through Spokane and then the rolling wheat fields of the Palouse, I jumped at the chance to buy a local whisky, more or less, with a most unusual mash bill. It languishes near the bottom of my Distiller list of 40-odd bottles thanks to its modest expert rating, but I like it a lot. Then again, I love buttered honey toast, so that’s not surprising. Sure it’s a bit one-dimensional - it’s a single grain American whisky - but what it does, it does well."

4.0,"Medium body wheat whiskey, nothing overly complex. Smooth and sweet cereal, even floral, flavor profile. Creamy, but light enough that it disappears in a cocktail against other strong flavors, so better sipped. Very good if you appreciate it for what it is (a young wheat whiskey) and isnt, and what Dry Fly is building in the Pacific NW."

3.0,This whiskey is VERY grain forward and screams wheat but it is sooo good! Although as a local I’m a bit bias!
3.0,"Almost like having toast with cinnamon and honey on it, finish is spicy but disappears quickly. An easy sipper."

3.75,"Color is a deep amber. Nose: A little bit of oak, a little slightly sweet fruit that I can't pinpoint. First sip: Strong oak with a good note of toasted bread. Finish: Savory, almost like the butter for the bread, as well as a good amount of cinnamon. Quick but powerful on the tongue. Not sweet like a Bourbon, but also not dry either. Overall this lacks a little complexity, which makes sense given the relatively young age and 100% wheat Mashbill, but the flavors that are present are more than sufficient to make this a nice change of pace that is still recognizable as American Whiskey with the oak and spice."
