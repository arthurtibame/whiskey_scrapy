2.5,"The nose has a surprisingly dry, mineral rye character. There are some wood and spices on the nose too with a kind of musty earthiness. The palate has a flavor I expect from Laws with a kind of mustiness that is like gross bread. The palate is fairly light, though it is only 3 years. It's oily with some bursts of spice the are distinctly barrel flavored rather than the sweet cinnamon that characterizes many whiskeys. There's a little bit of red fruit, but it isn't a major component. It has sort of that off note that Old Forester Signature does, but with a bit more complexity. There's a hint of coconut and maybe toasted almond coming from the oiliness, but it isn't enough. I appreciate some elements of this, so it isn't a total loss, but it's really not an enjoyable sipper. I can believe that this was aged in Armagnac casks, but I'm disappointed by the outcome. The complexity really is kind of interesting, but the result is just not that tasty. The soft tannins are nice, though they are eventually numbing."
