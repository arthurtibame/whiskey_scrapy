4.75,"Rich, buttery mouth feel. Lots of oak and tastes like a high-rye bourbon. Finish is extremely long. If you like Old Ezra 7, you'll like this. Bottle is from barrel #34, distilled 5/12 and bottled 8/19."

4.0,Crispy with a sharp introduction that gives to an exceptionally smooth finish. Molasses to the smell and vanilla and maple to the taste

3.0,"[11.27.2014] Lucky I found this at a local store - only one bottle left. Nose opens up as salty caramel. Visually only a little oil. The wood is fresh and very strong. If i didn't know better, I'd say that these barrels aren't charred or aged before casking. Slight spice and malt, not overly sweet or complex. This tastes homegrown and simple - just as advertised and perfect to celebrate an ancient holiday. 

Now that I see the origin comments in Distiller, I'm left understanding that off taste in the background (apple brandy) and wondering how this can be sold as bourbon if not in new casks?"

Neat
The nose is a faint corn and butter. Creamy mouth feel that warms the tongue and continues down the throat with a nice spicy finish. Sweet on the palate. Smooth overall, it must be be applejack cask finish. This is unique, I will be keeping a bottle in the cabinet."
