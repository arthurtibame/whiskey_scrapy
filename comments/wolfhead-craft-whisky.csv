3.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from November 2016

Tried this at my brother in laws house in Windsor. Wolfhead is a craft distillery from Amherstburg, Ontario. This is batch number 2. 

I have no real info on this distillery yet so I can only make assumptions on certain things. Since it's a marketed as a craft distillery I would think this is natural color and non chill filtered. The color is light amber and it comes in at 40% ABV. 

The nose is a little harsh at first but really mellows out in the glass. Unfortunately there is a lemongrass scented humidifier filling the air right now so that is affecting my ability to properly review this one. I can say that it is pretty nice. Orange peel, toffee, caramel, some vanilla and cinnamon. Very light. 

The palate is also light, but very smooth. Citrusy with light oak flavors. I think the humidifier is really affecting the taste too so I'll leave it at that for now. 

It's good stuff regardless. Not typical of a Canadian whisky, not as sweet or as rye heavy. More like a bourbon but at the same time not a bourbon. 3.25"
