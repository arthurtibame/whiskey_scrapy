2.5,"Well, this is aged 22mo.  This was rated highly by Jim Murray, but really this is just a young whiskey with grain-to-glass being the reason for the price.  It tastes young, but does have depth that I wouldn’t expect for 22 months in the barrel.  Corn is prevelant throughout.  The finish does bring the most depth with some light fruit and sweetness like vanilla.  But for close to $50, there are just way better options out there.  5.7/10"
