4.5,"I'm completely, pleasantly surprised. I was expecting something gimmicky and disgusting. In actuality, it works.

I'm not sure what to say about flavor other than this is smooth and tastes like cold brewed coffee whiskey. The nice thing is that there is no sugar added, unlike most coffee vodka. The nose has a pleasant, soft, cold brew aroma that is coffee first, whiskey second.  The flavor is smooth, and tastes like mildly extracted coffee fused with Jameson.

I guess, I'm pleasantly surprised because it tastes like what I hoped it would taste like, instead of tasting like what I feared it would taste like."
3.5,Super good over ice
4.0,Smells sweet but isn’t overly so in taste. It’s smooth with a little bitter/salty finish. It’s pretty good and definitely has a place.
4.0,"Nice, strong coffee scent on the nose. The coffee flavor comes through more than the whisky, but it works nicely. Very smooth and easy to drink. Slightly bitter aftertaste that balances the coffee nicely."

3.0,"I'm wondering where's the vanilla? I taste the coffee, obviously, and the whiskey on the backend. But the official review said the most prominent note is vanilla. 
I liked this very much, especially seeing as I used it to wash down Hot Wings. I'm going to go out on a limb, and say it pairs well with hot and spicy foods, or if you're an Irish Coffee freak."

2.5,Not bad over ice. A good balance of whiskey and coffee but a little weak.
3.75,"Tasted both neat and in an Iced Irish Coffee with sweet creamer. 
Neat, it's not a great whiskey, overly bitter, thin, tastes more like coffee than whiskey. 2 stars there. 
But that's not what it's really meant for.....
Mixed in the drink over ice is where it shines. It holds up to the creamer nicely, provides a solid coffee flavor, and is high-enough proof to keep the booze in place. I'll definitely continue using this as a mixer going forward."

3.5,St patty’s day! Very coffee forward
3.5,Surprisingly smooth
3.75,"Bought it because it’s St. Patrick’s day and because this isn’t a normal Irish whiskey.  Strong coffee flavor and strong whiskey flavor similar to an Irish Coffee.  This is not sweet and sits at 30%.  I tried it neat, on the rocks, and on the rocks with a splash of cream.  All good!  Good novelty expression if you like coffee."

2.75,"Got a sample bottle. Tried this neat and in my morning coffee.

Neat: You get a bit of coffee and a bit of whiskey, and they both feel watered down. Its not sweet like Kahlua which is too sweet for my taste. This is a bit thin, but it seems this was meant to be a mixer.

In my coffee: You definitely taste more of the Irish whiskey when mixed with coffee. It adds a slight dark, bitter chocolate taste to my brew too."

3.0,"strong coffee smell but it is very bitter on the front and again a solid coffee flavor on the back. On the rocks is probably a bad way to drink it, likely would be great in a coffee."
3.75,"Genuinely surprised me. This is the first flavored whiskey I have genuinely enjoyed. On its own it’s just ok, but it’s definitely made to be a mixer and drank on ice. The flavor still holds up when mixed, and it’s not a bad bottle for the price."
3.25,"My interest was piqued by this since I get a lot of coffee and cream notes from Jameson's standard issue. The nose manages to maintain a hint of the whiskey base at first, but the dark cold brew coffee begins to dominate rather quickly. The taste is pretty straightforward. Strong black coffee and Jameson. Interesting interplay between the coffee and the creamier characteristics of Jameson. There is no sweetness here ala Kahlua, Bailey's or bourbon cream. This will be interesting to cocktail with, but it loses some points with me due to it's close to $30 price tag. I can buy a bottle of Grind Espresso Liqueur for almost $10 less and have a very similar cocktail base."

3.5,"Milky cold brew taste that is a bit chocolatey. Very smooth but tastes more like a ""hard"" cold brew coffee than is does a coffee infused whiskey. Would definitely go well with breakfast."
3.75,"This Jamison Cold Brew is quite refreshing! 

It comes with a rich oaky dark chocolate bite when you take your first sip leading to a robust Colombian/Arabica Bean. It leaves a pleasant restful punch to your palate.

I definitely recommend drinking this one on the rocks being Coldbrew.  It opens up nicely with a cube or two and the ice allows you to taste the flavour and the bean/ whiskey more fully. 

For the affordability of this blend it's a great afternoon (or morning drink.😉) If you wanna have a little bit of the whisky with a little bit of a pick me up then this is the one for you. Cheers!!🥃"

3.75,Excellent in a coffee cocktail
2.25,Not what I was expecting. Imagine pouring coffee into Jameson - same consistency & relative flavor. This would make a better mixer. Terrible neat but adequate with ice. Probably won't buy again.

3.0,I love coffee. So was real excited to taste this. Smells of coffee is pretty strong. A hint of dark chocolate. Taste is ok. You get a lil hint of coffee not as much as it smells. And I got a lot of dark chocolate. I wasn’t disappointed and I wasn’t impressed. Overall pretty good.
4.0,"If you love coffee, you’ll love this. Add a little vanilla almond milk and it tastes almost like a light White Russian. I prefer this on the rocks with no mixers."

3.5,"Not a bad blend, but was hoping for a slightly richer coffee flavor.  May work well in a mixed drink - was just ok over ice."
3.25,"For what it is, this is actually pretty good. Obviously it smells and tastes like coffee but I also got loads of vanilla and a hint of dark chocolate. That being said, it does taste a little to artificial for me and I consider this more of a novelty than anything else. It is however good for those early mornings or perhaps hunting camp!!"

3.0,The smell is nice. I’m a huge coffee drinker so I was stoked when I smelled it. As far as the taste tho... not so good. The coffee taste is completely gone and just tastes like your typical Jameson bottle. Very strange.
