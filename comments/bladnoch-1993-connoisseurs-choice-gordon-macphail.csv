3.5,Thanks to Mikael and the team for updating the app to allow photos to be upload. Much better professional images can be attached now! Just need to start writing professional reviews now I guess :-). Well this won't be one of them sorry. Not a bad drop. Lovely honey and vanilla. $170 USD for a 12 year old. Even Macallan is better value than that. 3.5.
