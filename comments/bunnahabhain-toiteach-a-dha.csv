4.25,"This smoky, NAS Bunnahabhain is the follow up to the original Toiteach release from 2017.  It’s part of the Bunnahabhain Unable For Americans To Pronounce series.  Toiteach (pronounced toch-tach) translates to “smoky” in Gaelic, so Toiteach A Dha translates to “smoky two”.  It’s a robust 46.3%ABV.  It’s straw and light gold in color, oily and produces very heavy legs in the tasting glass.  Medium, but numerous, droplets form slowly around the lip as it settles back after a spin.

The nose is peppery and perfumed oak with a heavy, BBQ smoke and sea salt.  There’s a bit of sawdust and ABV swirling around before finally turning sweet with a hint of vanilla.

The palate starts off with more BBQ grill smoke and salted vanilla chews.  It’s slightly dry and warming while being ever so harsh.  Youthful juice, for sure.  The backend delivers a sweeter presence and leaves behind a healthy punch of juicy smoke.  This is all smoky peat- there’s no earthy characteristics to be found.

The finish is medium to long with mostly lingering oak.  It’s dry and a bit salty with a smoky coating covering your entire mouth.  Cigar lovers would probably love this whisky for its flavor and finish.

Overall, there’s really good value for your whisky dollar here as I paid $50 for this one.  It’s an excellent sequel to the original Toiteach- maybe offering a slightly deeper flavor profile and a little more depth.  Both bottles are highly recommended and it’s another win for Bunnahabhain’s NAS whisky run.  They keep knocking them out of the park.  4-4.25 stars.  Cheers."

3.75,"Very pleasantly peated without overpowering the strong notes of oak and spice from the barrel. Although Bunnahabhain is not typically peated, this bottle is ""refreshingly Islay. Perfect for those who like the idea of Smokey whisky, but are intimidated by it's pundency."
4.0,Very smooth. Like the peat flavors. Soft going down. Almost silky oily rich going down.

4.25,"Reasonably aged (NAS, but tastes to be at least 8-10 years) with a delicious smoky flavour and a long-but-not-aggressive finish.  Because the spiciness isn’t as overwhelming as the Palo Cortado or Bordeaux expressions, the salt and honey comes through very nicely on this one."
3.75,Easy drinking peat. Taste of plasters. Pepper.

Avent 2019 - 21/24.
Il fallait que les Cowboys gagnent aujourd'hui pour participer aux séries éliminatoires. Ils ont joué leur pire match de l'année. Osti que je suis tanné de prendre pour cette équipe dirigée par un imbécile. Au moins, il y avait ce scotch tourbé des Islay pour me faire oublier ça. C'est un petit délice qui coule en bouche comme un ruisseau au printemps."

3.5,"I'm over NAS's pumped out for a quick buck...TRE hell..like Zerg in the computer game Starcraft they have the ability to multiply rapidly and destroy any taste buds in their path. They are what you get when you cross accounting with sales and marketing and ruthlessly suppress the poor master distiller who prefers quality over quantity.

Now this isn't a bad example of one it's actually quite pleasant but it has no soul no sense of purpose unlike the fabulous 18 yr which is like I am Bunnahabhain let me destroy your liver with addictive goodness.

It's sweet smokey goodness. Nothing more or less, well executed and fairly priced."

2.75,"Edit: tasted this a few months later and had to make some corrections. 

I originally rated this way lower but that was because I really didn’t understand heavily peated whisky. But I slowly am getting there. 

The peat in this one now is actually quiet enjoyable. The taste itself is still isn’t much better but that isn’t caused by the peat smoke. While the nose is really quite enjoyable there are some weird moldy wood aromas on the palate and it also is quiet burny with its just 46 ABV. It is an OK dram but the Cruach Mhòna is way better while both of them being NAS."

4.0,I don't think this is a fair review. Is there that much lack of flavor profile on this that only two or three characteristics barely scratch the surface and the rest are zero? What is this? Just some smelly water cut down to 53.7% WBV by alcohol? I THINK NOT!!!!! It deserves a more fair shake.

4.0,"Nose: Iodone, mint, anise.  Toffee, treacle.  Green bell peppers, camphor.  Earthy peat and smoke - oversmoked brisket.  Green apples with lemon juice, honey, with some floral characteristics.

Palate: Earth, iodine, ash.  Honeyed stonefruits, orange blossom, green apple.  Black pepper, vanilla, and some oak.  Wintergreen, lemon oil, pine sap and tar.  Graham cracker and a slight cocoa/dusty leather.  Mouthfeel is medium light, with medium-high oil content.  Finish begins with a wash of wood, ash, dusty earth, and light stonefruit.  The sweeter layers peel off revealing some cocoa and dusty leather, which stays pretty consistent until the end, when some of the tannins pop out and you get a little brightness from the ethanol, along with green apple at the very tail end.  Medium-long finish.

Other notes: Being totally unfamiliar with anything else Bunnahabhain, I'm liking this.  A little different from what I normally reach for as far as Islay is concerned, the flavors on display are nice, albeit unique.  This sits somewhere between Ardbeg and Laphroaig, if I had to make a comparison.  Well worth a buy, though I probably won't seek it out again."

4.25,"Dram club 2 oz samples, the flight included Black Bottle, Tobermory 12, Deanston 12, Bunnahabhain 12 and Bunnahabhain Toiteach A Dha

Toy-chi Ka daw was how the brand rep pronounced it.  This one is a banger.  Reminds me of Laphroaig PX (which is awesome).  Rich and balanced and an all round good one.  The peat gives the extra kick that Bunnahabhain needs.  No bottles are available in my area but I would consider this one, the clear winner of the night.  

Very good, recommended. 

My ranking was 1. Bunnahabhain Toiteach A Dha, 2. Black Bottle, 3. Bunnahabhain 12, 4. Tobermory 12, 5. Deanston 12"

3.0,"Nose: A sweet and gentle peaty aroma. Pungent, but not acrid or sharp. Red berries and sweet fruits in the background from the sherry casks, along with notes of camphorwood and clove oil. There is a briny presence but unlike most peated Bunnahabhain it's not maritime. It's more savory, like the aroma of heavily salted barbecue pork.

Palate: Starting sweet and fruity, it rapidly gains a grapefruit and slight plastic/rubber note. Green capsicum, cabbage water, green apple peel and gherkin brine follow as it develops, culminating in a bright, shimmering saline presence that cascades into the finish. The mouth-feel is drying, cooling but just a little too much on the watery side for my preference, with a brackish character.

Finish: Medium. Cracked black pepper leading into a salty aftertaste.

The nose is most enjoyable - complex, rounded and satisfying. However I thought the palate did not live up to the nose, being rather simple and thin with the only outstanding notes being some strident salt and bitter/sour fruit.

Nevertheless, on the whole I liked the profile but I thought both the strength and texture could be improved. I would very much like to taste it at a slightly higher abv and with a more oily texture. As it is it seemed a little shallow. Adding a dash of water did deepen the mouth-feel but it also compromised everything else. If you do like this profile then you're probably going to enjoy it most when neat.

It's an acceptable and enjoyable dram, worth trying but not one I would ever buy. There are many more interesting peated whiskies from which to choose, including several from Bunnahabhain.

Tasted from a 30ml sampler.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
3.5,"The nose has some smoke, but quite a bit of sweet sherry and brine.  Perhaps a hint of vanilla.
Decently smokey.  I can taste the classic Bunnahabhain flavor behind the smoke, but it's a bit muted by peat and sherry, though I get some buttery shortbread.  The sherry flavors here are sweet and raisiny.  I get a bitter, vegetal, earthy aftertaste mixed with salt and ashy smoke.  I think it's a decent whiskey, but the finish is a bit unusual and I can't decide if I like it or not.  The ashy smoke lingers, which I like quite a bit, but I'm not as keen on the bitter vegetal note.  I'll have to drink more and see if my opinion changes.  I had a small pour of this, followed by a decent sized pour of Laphroaig Lore, followed by more of this which is what I'm actually reviewing.  I'll have to revisit it some other night and just have it by itself."
