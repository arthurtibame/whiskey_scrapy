3.25,"Well, this one is a dud. Totally unappealing, i rated it 62 out of 100, and when i see that number i think is too high for what it really is, but the finish is long and it helps it a lot in the score.

Bottled at 43%abv, pale Staw color.

On the nose the aroma is so difficult to perceive, it is too light and you almost have to put your nose inside the glencairn to get some notes. I let it rest for 10 minutes and it didn't change a thing. Notes: corn with butter on it, tobbacco leaf, prune peel, hay and maybe ashes. The aroma is so dim it is difficult to tell.

On the palate: oak, hot taste with a pepper note, mouth watering and long lasting finish with the same flavor profile. Nothing special. I added water, a couple drops, it killed the rest of the aroma and kill any flavor, two drops and now it is water. I dont know if i got a bad batch or something, but i would not recommend or buy any more of it."

3.0,"On this side of the Atlantic, I'm having a nip of Dualchas rather than Legacy...sounds like trademark issues were involved. I had rock bottom expectations here; I didn't love the 12 year when I had it in Inverness over the summer, but after hearing the Scotch Test Dummies rave about Dualchas as a tremendous value, and then catching their livestream with a couple of guys from the distillery (worth finding on youtube), I had to try it. And, at $25 for the bottle...why the hell not? I can hardly order takeout for that much anymore. On both the nose and palate, it's a very light, delicate dram - the nose has a milky breakfast cereal quality, with a bit of vanilla and honey. Cereal with vanilla yogurt, maybe? The palate is fairly grain-forward, but speaks to the distillery's stated goal of creating an entry-level NAS that was profoundly different in taste profile from the 12 year...and it is that. The bourbon cask influence here does come through with a bright, sweet vanilla quality, though it's a bit thin in terms of mouthfeel. This is a perfect gateway scotch for someone who ""doesn't like"" scotch, but will drink Irish or bourbon. I don't see it becoming my go-to, but at $25, at least I feel like I'm getting my money's worth."
3.0,"Gift set sample. 

Nose: Apple juice, pear, vanilla, malt
Palate: Orchard fruit, sweet, vegetal note of thick end of a thick carrot. 
Finish: Short, dry. 

A bit of a Johnny one note. Not much depth or complexity. I'm guessing this NAS whisky is fairly young. 

Drinkable. 72 points, 3 stars."

3.0,"I had a great time drinking my way through this cheap, NAS bottle from one of my favorite budget distilleries: Tomatin.  This bottle has been rebranded for its release here in North America.  Here it’s called “Dualchas”.  I don’t know what that means or why it was necessary to rename it, but it is the exact same single malt they call Legacy everywhere else around the world.  Shrugs.

This stuff is aged in a combination of ex-bourbon casks and new, virgin oak casks and then blended together before bottling.  I didn’t see any indication of possibles ages here, but based on flavor profile and how insanely smooth it is I’d guess it’s between 6-8 years old.

The nose it typical Highland style:  lightly dusted apples, vanilla and oak spices.  All indicators of the casks in play here.  The palate has plenty of wood notes (especially pine) and a little sugary lemon.  It feels pretty smooth, if a little thick, on the tongue.  There’s nothing harsh or offensive at all.  It’s solid from start to finish.  Speaking of finish, it’s short to medium in length, sweet before becoming a tad bit dry.

Overall, this is the definition of a baseline whisky from Tomatin.  It’s surely “crushable” to me, as I believe I worked through this entire bottle in about 2 weeks.  I used this as a primer for my tasting sessions and even cleaned up with it after a night of heavier-than-usual sipping.  It was easy to reach for this one.  If you factor in that this bottle can be bought for less than $30 everywhere- that makes it a winner.  If you don’t go in expecting big things I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.  I would take this bottle over every single bottom shelf blended whisky and feel like I hit the VFM lottery.  3 stars for the whisky with a half star bump for the value.  3.5 stars, my friends.  Cheers."

3.0,"Ah Tomatin. The budget single malt. Legacy, or Dualchas as it’s called here in the US, is the least expensive of the Tomatin core range. The12 year old comes in at around $35, whereas this one is a more than affordable $25. What kind of quality can be had in a single malt for so low a price?  Let’s find out. 

This Highland NAS is bottled at 43% ABV and is more than likely chill filtered with colorant added making it a yellow gold. 

The nose is ripe with soft fruits. Lots of pineapple, some oranges, tangerines, apricots and some coconut. Honey, dry grasses and fairly malty. Sanded oak, some syrupy sweetness. Apples, pears, weak cinnamon and cocoa powder. Buttery biscuits and light vanilla. A little bit of a chalky/mineral quality which is the only real blemish here other than being fairly light overall. 

The palate delivers as expected for 43%. Oranges, pineapple, tangerines. Grassy, hay and some faint oak. Vanilla and very light lemon and cinnamon. Pepper builds the more you drink it which really gives it the power that the nose was lacking. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is oily and very mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium short, fruity with a touch of oak and mouthwatering throughout. 

Well, at $25 this is a very solid malt. Mostly light in profile but the flavors are there where it counts. Other than the pineapple, nothing really stands out, but there is nothing really bad about it either. I think I might prefer this to the 12 year old. It may have less complexity, but the 12 has a bitterness in the finish that was hard to get past. This one does not and is $8-10 less. Factoring quality and value for money, this is a solid 3.5 and possibly a 3.75. Thanks to @LeeEvolved for the sample. 
Cheers"

The finish starts strongly bitter but mellows To a nice balance. A little water enhances the sweetness and brings out some pepper and cinnamon notes. Along both a slight mellowing of the bitter notes, it is clearly the way to go."
