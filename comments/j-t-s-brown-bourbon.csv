4.0,Was blessed to try a 94 dusty of this and was really pleased! The fish oil taste on that older bottle was a little much but I enjoyed it none the less
2.0,Good bang for the buck. Mixes OK and I've even enjoyed sipping it - no off notes at
1.75,"tastes about right for the price, acceptable as a mixer for some drinks. would like to try the BIB version as I have heard good things about this offering."
1.5,Yikes!
2.5,"Served neat in a Glencairn.
Nose: nail polish and classic bourbon vanilla. Faint cherry and...mint? Menthol maybe.  

Palate: Not bad but not a bargain bin find of your favorite kentucky bourbon. It isn't complex but I'm finding it hard to describe. There's wood and barrel spice and a lot of really nice notes but they're there and then gone after the swallow. I hope that's just because its 80 proof.

Finish: Really not bad. Its decent and then gone. I agree that the nose is way worse than the taste. Someone said there's fish like smell and I can agree that once I opened the bottle there was something weird there. But at 1 liter for under $10 I'm pleasantly surprised. 

Bottom line: If you can find the bottled in bond, grab it."

2.75,Kind of a one or two note drink
3.0,"Pleasant for the money. Straight smells worse, but actually seems to have less of a hot mid palate. Adding a little water remove the initial bite, but harshens up mid, and then leaves a pleasant after taste. Smells a bit harsh without water, but with water, it develops kind of a floral note. For $12, it's not a bad whiskey."
