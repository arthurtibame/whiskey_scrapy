3.25,"Was expecting more. A bit simple, not that flavorful for an 18 yo. Still a good one though"
4.5,"An initial alcoholic puncture welcomes the nose, but in a short time the smell becomes very fruity, with cooked pear, raisins, pineapple, ripe figs, lemon note and nutmeg. Frosted cereals (like Kellog's Frosties) in the background. Harmonious and layered sweetness.
In the mouth it becomes warmer and spicier, like a pear and cinnamon cream cake, flakes of milk chocolate, hazelnuts, candied orange, a pinch of star anise. It has a slight roughness of the background, of leather and wood, in an interesting game of contrasts.
Medium long finish, with hazelnut chocolate, cinnamon, cooked pear.
If the contrast in the aromas had been more intense I would have found it more amusing, however it remains a whisky that is anything but boring, complex, and deserves more attention."

3.5,"Достаточно мягок. Ножки в бокале прям таки весьма. Маслянистый и тягучий со вкусом ирисок и ванили, полнотелый. Долгое и богатое завершение. Под вдумчивый, особый вечер и с сигарой. 3,5. Цена завышена, на мой взгляд"
