4.5,"Delightful on the nose strong, rich sherry notes.

The body is also full of sherry - very strong sherry body, but not overly sweet, it has a nice balance.  I get raisins and wood, but the wood is not too strong - it sort of hides behind the sweeter sherry notes.  I get a bit of vanilla and a puff of smoke to round out the sherry.

This is a rich, excellent dram."

null,"Batch 7. Incredible. If you love bourbon and scotch - and you’re seeking unicorn quality whiskey with drinkable prices - This is the sweet spot you’re looking for- end of story. If you like cask strength blantons,
Pappy 23, glendronach 18, hochstadter’s 16, or four roses single barrel OBSV- then you will love this. 
A heaping dose of Carmel, chocolate, lemon, vanilla, oak, cherries, ... and all the other qualities of great whiskey wrapped up into every sip. HOWEVER- it’s not for the faint of heart- this is very HOT stuff- at 115 proof it drinks nicely, spicy - but for me not overpowering and hollow like may others at this proof.  For those seeking $400 tasting whiskey - grab this bottle and enjoy! Sooo good."

4.0,I like GlenDronach and this doesn't disappoint. Defintely let it breath for a bit and after trying it neat add a bit of water to really open up the flavour palette. Patience will be rewarded.
4.0,"This is Batch #3 and it comes in at 54.9%/109.8 proof.  The label highlights Oloroso and Pedro X sherry cask, but I'll be damned if all I get up front is new oak.  Fresh, vibrant oak.  This NAS beast is young.  (Now I'll freely admit that I usually dilute cask strength whisky with a few drops of water as a rule, but I ALWAYS, ALWAYS take the first sniff and sip as the distillery intends- Neat).  If you don't do this I have 2 words for you...come on.

15 minutes in the Glencairn glass and I'm still sniffing- hoping for something other than oak.  A bit of sweetness has snuck into my scotch. 

The first sip at full strength and the oak and spice flood the tongue, fool around and let it settle into your mouth and the pepper and allspice begin to take your breath and send a burning sensation up the nose.  God, I love cask strength.  If you let the heat escape and gently swirl the remaining juice you get rewarded with a bit of zesty citrus.  The bottle says there's a heavy malt presence but I don't get it because the citrus or heat has muted it.

The finish is long, spicy and hot- as most cask strength bottlings are.  If you're a bourbon-head you'll appreciate this, if not you may be gasping for air.  I guess I'm a little bit of both- I loved it but found myself subconsciously being thankful it was over.  I immediately reached for another sip because, well, I have a problem:  Too much good whisky and not enough time to drink it all.

This bottle runs significantly higher than most of its brethren:  I wanna say this bottle was close to $110+, but if you like spicy, oaky and high proof bourbon-esque scotches you'll be thrilled."

5.0,Magical stuff.  So smooth and flavoursome.  Tried alongside Glengoyne cask strength.  This was undoubtedly better.

4.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from December 2016

This Glendronach Cask Strength is from batch #3. It comes in at 54.9% ABV, is a natural amber bronze color and is non chill filtered. 

I hardly ever add water to a whisk(e)y, not because I'm some purist who says the way it's bottled is the way I drink it, but because I rarely feel that water is needed. This single malt scotch is one of those that deeply benefits from water. 

Initially on the nose there is a noticeable alcohol burn and strong oak aromas. Once these fade a little, I got a sweetness characteristic of both sherried whisky and bourbon. Raisins, sherried fruits and some vanilla. With water I was able to pick up on cola (think flat RC cola), licorice, orange peel, cocoa and candies fruits. I was surprised how many additional notes came out with water. Usually water just makes whisky smell weak and watery. 

I have to admit I had a hard time discerning the palate. Very hot at first with intense oak. Water brings out quite a bit of sweetness and sherried fruits. Unfortunately that's all I could really pick out, just an overall sweetness and maybe some mild oranges. 

The mouthfeel was somewhat hot and oily without water. 

The finish was fairly long, dry but sweet and with a little spice. 

The evolution of this whisky when water is added is like nothing I've ever had. Those that love a strong bourbon would really appreciate this single malt. It's sweet with heat and intensity. Personally, I don't think I would buy a full bottle. I don't like having to add water to make my whisky taste the way I want it to. I know that by adding water I can get more value out of the bottle, but I'd rather not have to bust out the graduated cylinders and figure out the perfect ratios for full enjoyment. Thanks to @LeeEvolved for the sample. 3.75-4
Cheers"

4.0,"Batch #6- Delicious stuff, this is what the 12 yo could be with a slightly higher abv. PX and oloroso play really well together and make for what’s definitely a younger whisky, but one that has more punch and complexity due to the 55% abv. Great drinker!"
4.0,Heavy pepper. Bracing.
