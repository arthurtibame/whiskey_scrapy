4.0,"What does a man do with an hour to kill before his flight? Work, catch up on paperwork or drink...definately the later. So after a brief detour to my mums I'm back at my favorite whiskey bar in the world Last Word. 

6 whiskies: Dingle batch 4, Method and Madness Single Malt; Springbank 21, HP 14 Loyalty of the Wolf; GoT Talisker and Laga....now that is an eclectic line up to make me salivate!

Ah Dingle, Dingle little star how I wonder.. why the hell you weren't around when I lived in the emerald isles. 

It's a dram I shouldn't really like - light and on the face of it simple...but it's not really simple and all components come together really well. Great balance.

It's definitely a dram that builds as you swirl in your mouth and go hmmm. Think batch 2 pot still was better but still very solid for a young dram."

4.0,Possibly the best young single malt on the market!   I expect great things from this distillery as their products get more time in oak
4.5,"Dingle’s artisan distillery is situated in the picturesque township for which it is named in southwest Ireland. Located on the Dingle Peninsula and its mesmerizing coastline, the area is abounding in natural beauty making it a popular tourist destination. We passed the distillery on our way to Ceann Sibéal (Dingle Golf Links) last September with a plan to stop there on our return. Unfortunately, a humble facility, described by their website as a “tin shed,” left us somewhat uninspired. This, coupled with bad timing, prompted a pass on an opportunity, which I now regret after tasting this superb creation. The distillery filled their first whiskey casks in December of 2012, and later bottled at the required 3 years and a day. This taste was their Small Batch No.4 Release, provided at a lofty 46.5% ABV. The single malt was triple distilled in “distinctively designed” stills incorporating a boil ball that promotes spirit refluxing. The company asserts this results in a spirit with “remarkable smoothness and purity.” This was found to be 100% true. The whiskey was matured in a multitude of cask types to include ex-bourbon, ex-sherry (Oloroso & PX), and ex-port. Appearing sherry-tinted amber, the whiskey noses slightly muted with hints of Oloroso. An extraordinarily smooth palate is rich in flavor and viscosity. Vanilla and malt are accompanied with sweet sherry components of dried fruits and nuts, then transitions into a delightful dry port finish. The collaboration of winey elements work tremendously well together resulting in a well crafted, high quality potable that I would rate at 4.5 stars."
