4.5,"North Star Spirits tasting night, Sydney, 18 July 2019. Whisky #2

Nose Neat: Rich, well rounded sweet cereal (a classic grain whisky profile). Gently fruity (sultanas, cranberries), golden syrup, vanilla, coconut, milk chocolate, milk coffee and a touch of mint.
Nose Watered: Uncannily like rum (see notes below).

Palate Neat: A little hot and drying on the arrival from the high alcohol content, but the flavour profile is soft and elegant with barley sugar, butterscotch, treacle, vanilla, dried fruit, and a mild spicy oakiness. The texture is silky and satiny and there is a rum-like note.
Palate watered: The texture is magnified enormously, and the palate develops strongly towards the profile of rum.

Finish Neat: Medium. Sweet vanilla and sugary fruit tones.
Finish watered: Medium/long. A relaxed sweet cereal and spicy fruit finale with a spiced rum aftertaste.

A fine and immensely enjoyable old single grain whisky. It has excellent balance and is very harmoniously composed.

There are two entirely different experiences with this whisky. Taken neat it presents a sweet, fruity and cereal character such as you would expect from Scottish grain spirit that has received long and gentle maturation. Imagine Compass Box Hedonism that has been placed in a good-quality ex-bourbon cask for 30 years.

However, add a healthy dash of water and allow it to rest for 20 minutes or so and this initially competent spirit morphs into magisterial excellence. Water is not only recommended it is absolutely mandatory for this whisky.

Initially, watering seems to merely dilute and sweeten the palate, and add some breadth. However as it recomposes in the glass a transformation occurs in which all facets of the whisky recombine into a new profile that is uncannily akin to a very fine Trinidad rum.

This profile shifts and re-sets constantly. One moment you would swear it is rum and the next it is clearly barley spirit. We've all had whiskies that are finished in rum casks and wondered ""hmm, so where's the rum influence?"" well, this dram is how you had always wished those whiskies would smell and taste.

The cask that aged this spirit yielded just 190 bottles. If you can find one I would urge you to buy it. It's not cheap, but the experience is unique and unforgettable.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"
