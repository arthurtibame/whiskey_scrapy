3.25,"Heavy peat up front, but with a sweet finish. subsequent sips have more bitterness in the finish. Some mouthburn, but otherwise goes down easy. It hits the stomach with a pretty hard burn, though."

Without water, sharp notes of a young desert wine do not play well with an ashtray that needs to be dumped.  The alcohol is too present, and the dram is too dense.  Generous water releases a more typical Oloroso nose, which gives way to a sweet BBQ palate, and an ashtray finish.  Water definitely smooths out this beast, but also reveals some acrylic notes that were previously masked by the high ABV.  The liquid plastic is something that spoils sherried peated whiskies that are too young.  Laphroaig NAS’s such as the PX cask and the Triple Wood are the biggest offenders.  This Kilchoman gets kudos for being single cask with a very clear age.  But the kudos gets retracted for being quite over $100.  Young peated whiskies should be bourbon matured.

4.25,"Sample review. Very nice natural colour to start with. Peat on the nose with nice dark fruit notes. No alcohol burn at all. On the palate there's brine, a nutty flavour, peat and faint dark fruit notes. Delicious! the finish is medium long and consistent of a sweet peat smoke. Great expression from Kilchoman"
