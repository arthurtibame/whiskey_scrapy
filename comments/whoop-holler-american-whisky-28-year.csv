3.0,Smooth but too much oak
2.0,I love most of the Orphan barrel whiskeys but Whoop and Hooper leaves much to be desired.  The taste is too sharp and bitter.  Too long on the barrel and too much heat.  I do NOT recommend.
4.0,"This bottle isn't that bad, but has very heavy oak and black pepper notes. Additionally leather notes are evident but the complexity and other flavours seem to be drowned out by the oak and pepper. I would give  this bourbon 3.5 out of 5 but unfortunately they don't give you that option. Additionally, this bourbon is a bit overpriced, and if you like a lighter bourbon with a mild oak flavours this bottle may not be for you."

3.0,Quite disappointing. More history than enjoyable whiskey.  Over-oaked and difficult to distinguish any positive flavors.

3.75,"Nice leathery nose although the palate disappointed a bit in complexity and depth. Interesting to try a 28-yr bourbon though, probably the oldest I’ve seen."
