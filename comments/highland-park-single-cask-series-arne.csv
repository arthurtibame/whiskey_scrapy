4.75,"A fellow enthusiast just picked up this Total Wine exclusive. *Extremely* limited release... one barrel! By my taste, it’s worth it.
2018 bottling (distilled 2004 - 13 year), barrel strength at 63% abv, finished in a refilled Sherry butt.

The nose has a good Sherry tang to it, with a strong flavor of honey, new leather, and a touch of rose. There’s a lingering fresh pear.
The taste is a bit sharp, but not harsh. A good heat, but very little burn. The honey carries through along with oak and black pepper. No peat at all.
The finish holds the heat a long time. The pepper lingers on the back of the palate, still glazed with honey.

One of our cadre said it invokes a nice cabin in the high Sierra mountains, with snow outside and a very warm fire inside."
