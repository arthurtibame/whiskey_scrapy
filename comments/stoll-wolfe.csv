3.5,"Batch 15, bottle 123, 86 proof. A bit of sharpie marker on the nose, and some sour fruit. A hint of clove. On the palate, smooth, tastes like honey. Not much of the young notes I expect from craft distilleries these days, thankfully. Palate is much better than the nose. After the wave of honey, there's lingering spice. Not complex, but it's pleasant and very drinkable. 4/18/2020"
