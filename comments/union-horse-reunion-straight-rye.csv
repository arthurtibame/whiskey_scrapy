3.0,vanilla and cinnamon on the nose with hints of allspice and alcohol. Very vegetable and green pepper on the palate and some hint of allapice. there's a slight almost burnt flavor as well. very chewy. subtly hot.

4.25,"The first of anything I've tried from Union Horse. Very impressed with this.  Rich, bold, full and a very complex aroma that just covers a very curious funky fruit note from the yeast. Sweet, vanilla, and smokey. Much better than I expected. 

It is a 100% rye, aged in full size barrels."
