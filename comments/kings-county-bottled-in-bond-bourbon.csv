3.25,"This one is nice, but honestly not worth the additional cost over the standard Bourbon. At the same cost as the Barrel Proof, it's not worth the price. It's still a nice pour. Honey, burnt brown sugar and vanilla are the predominant notes."
4.25,"Ok, wow. This is some awesome Bourbon. I am actually Reviewing the barrel strength Bourbon. Batch 11. 63.6% ABV. 
This is one incredibly smooth Bourbon! Very viscous. Rich butterscotch, corn bread and toffee notes. Slight spice swell on the mid pallette with a medium to long oak driven finish. Very nice for such a young Bourbon. These guys know what they are doing and this is one of the best craft whiskeys I have tasted."

3.0,curious.  not worth the price but still drinkable.  soft.
5.0,Full mouth feel with enough heat to make you realize you are drinking a good one. Solid vanilla and oak on the nose with a very round nearly sweet finish. New top five contender.

3.75,"Tastes young but good. Finish is really short and there’s not really much to it. Smells like snickerdoodles and caramel, after a few minutes turns to warming spices and vanilla bread pudding. Still not much to it on taste. Needs to age longer"

4.25,"very sweet Caramel and brown sugar in the nose 

Also sweet and toasty on the front end that is broken up by a mild oaky smoke tase for a brief moment then sweet caramel with the spice that you would expect from 100 proof."
3.75,Strong lingering burn on the nose and on the finish. Chocolate and caramel on palate.

3.75,Molasses and chocolate aroma. Very hard to pick out distinct notes. Huge body and mouthfeel. Deep chocolate and Asian spices.
