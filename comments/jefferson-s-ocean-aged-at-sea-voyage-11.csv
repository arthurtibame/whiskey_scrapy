4.5,Love this one. Smooth mouthfeel. Spice and vanilla up front. Leather nose. Spice and oak carries through. Touch of salt on finish. Light feel but strong taste throughout. Just damn good.

4.25,One of firsts when I started expanding my whiskey taste.  Tasting a little cherry sweetness that I didn’t remember. That slight salty finish is pairing quite nicely with my cigar tonight.
