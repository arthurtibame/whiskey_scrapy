2.0,"Young, grassy. I tried to like it...three separate times. Didn't like it."
3.5,Very easy to drink. Smooth and non offensive. I get a very sweet corn flavor with this one. A bit dry. Faint mint and Oak presence. Too sweet for my taste. Was hoping to get that tobacco note the expert reviewer mentioned but I must have missed that. Similar to Buffalo Trace Straight Bourbon Single Barrel in sweetness but smoother.

4.0,"Taste-  2 oz. neat in glen cairn.

Nose-  French vanilla, and butterscotch dominate a soft nose.  There is also a pastry-like aroma that reminds me of pop-overs.

Taste-  Really nice notes of sweet vanilla, fresh churned butter, and a slight maple note.  The mouthfeel is very coating for the 92 proof.  There is a pleasant sweetness and balance to this one.  Nicely rounded.

Finish-  long lasting pastry type finish.....think boston cream donut, almost custard like.  The only flaw is a bit of bitterness that lingers.  There is a cherry tartness that is a great surprise at the end if you stay with it

Overall-  I am really impressed!  This reminds me alot of a wheated version of Yellowstone.  It lacks the oaky older notes of a more elder statesman, but it delivers on the sweet, pastry-like taste of a great wheated bourbon.  What really surprised me is the luxurious richness for what looks like a younger bourbon (strawlike in color appearance) and a lower proof (thinner quicker running legs).  This is likely attributed to the french oak finishing which adds a nice complexity level, and perhaps tempers some of the rougher edges.  I can't help but make the comparison to some of the 4 year old Yellowstone store picks that I have had and thoroughly enjoyed, although this is punched up a bit in flavor layers.  A definate bottle buy for me."
4.0,"Light, good initial burn but smooth going down. 

You should smell the French oak and caramel initially. 

The taste starts with a light burn, which creates an after tingle with the oak lingering.

2nd time the smell is the same, taste has no burn or tingle.

The French Oak is a very strong flavor, would have liked to taste the caramel more."
4.0,Smooth. Easy to drink
2.5,Not my favorite. Definitely oaked
3.75,Good woody note. Dry but quite smooth at the same time.
