4.0,"Utterly unique. Had this at CC Lounge in Toronto before a Fleet Foxes show and must say the whole night was memorable. This is very soft and but has depth, very fresh and raw but balanced. Like I said unique."

4.0,Another one from Koval that says: why are we still obsessed with corn? This could have made Quaker into an alcoholic.

4.0,"I may be biased since they're local, but I really appreciate Koval's dedication to experimentation. This is a truly unique whiskey thanks to the 100% oat mash bill. The oatiness comes through on nose and palate both, with a creamy and buttery character about it. There's also plenty of baking spice and tart apple on the nose, plus a slight petroleum note. Young, but still smooth, the palate opens with the petroleum, but quickly gives way to vanilla cream, cinnamon, and some fruitiness as the sweetness creeps in at the end...kind of like a good bowl of oatmeal. A 3.5 from me, and a well-earned one."

3.5,"Nose:
Herbs, primarily thyme and marjoram
Oak char (i.e., brown sugar, toasted marshmallow)
Faint black pepper
Caramel

Taste:
Baking spices
Potpourri 
Creamy and rich, like coffee ice cream
Tanniny finish

The nose on this whiskey is truly exquisite. If my house smelled like this whiskey I'd be in heaven. The taste is good, but doesn't measure up to the nose. Nevertheless, this is a Koval product I'd probably buy again. Odd that my favorite Koval choices have been the Oat and Millet whiskey."
