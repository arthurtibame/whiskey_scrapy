4.25,"This is probably the first scotch that I have liked so far. There is hardly any burn on either the nose or the taste. On the nose, I definitely smell cherry and other fruits. The taste is pretty similar, with the slightest bit of smokiness. It can be pretty sweet to drink a couple ounces at a time, but I definitely really like it, and it has opened me up to trying new scotches."

4.5,"Quite pleasant. Sweet malt,and alcohol are the main players on the nose. Candied sugars and caramel apples are the first notes then, fruity (apple,pear,peach) are the first on the palate. Extremely pleasant to drink. This should be in every scotch drinkers bar."

4.0,"New to the world of whiskey but easily the best one I’ve tried so far. I would recommend this to anyone that has trouble drinking whiskey neat.  It’s very smooth. 

Starts off light with grassy citrusy notes but then quickly fades into almonds, dried berries and short bread. With a finish of chocolate covered raisins and a touch of coffee bitterness."

4.5,"Rich flavors of chocolates, fruits, spice and smoke. The finish lingers and it's like you just ate a salty dark chocolate bar. This might be the best scotch to transition a bourbon drinker to scotch. I suggest checking your local Walgreens for this one. Half the price of totalwine"

4.0,First bottle of Dalmore.  Tried it on a cruise and now it seems a little sweet.  Get the citrus and vanilla.  A little of the chocolate.  For the price I prefer macallan 12.

3.75,"The dram has an amber colour, at standard 40% abv. The nose begins with vanilla, fresh orange, slightly sweet, with a subtle hint of chocolate. Palate is soft, some fruitiness, especially oranges, hint of smoke, later slightly sour with some oak inference, not spicy. Finish is raisiny, smooth and chocolate-like, short to medium in length. 
Overall an easy sipper, but a little pricy for the taste.
Out of curiosity, I once mixed it with some mediocre Canadian whisky (1:1), and there was saltiness and more smoky flavours on the palate."

2.5,"Very light, apples, very smooth, slight cherry. Middle of the road, not extremely exciting.

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"
4.75,"Nose - malty, spiced oranges, vanilla, leather, and some hints of cinnamon roasted almonds and a whiff of coffee
Taste -  orange zest and vanilla, some oak spice and cinnamon, hints of dark chocolate and a bit of roasted salted almonds
Finish - the citrus fades and leaves behind a slightly tannic dryness, the spice lingers for awhile and medium burn"

4.0,"I was checking out a liquor store nearby that I’d never been to. Most of the prices were in line or slightly above market. But I noticed this sitting on the shelf, since I’d been considering it for a while but kept choosing other things for the same price (usually $65-$75 range). This was listed at $59. When I went to pay, the owner told me this had been on the shelf a while which was why it was cheaper than it should be. But here’s the kicker, this was the box set that comes with two Glencairn glasses. I actually feel like I got a steal!

On the nose: It has a familiar nose. Perhaps I drink too much Aberlour, but it’s awfully similar. Dark fruit heavy. Virtually no oak and definitely no char.

On the palette: again, I taste Aberlour. But this is slightly different. There is a semblance of oak, which makes sense with some of the juice spending it’s full life span in ex bourbon casks. It’s not very chewy like an Islay would be.. it’s balanced and neither delicate nor full. It slides right in and the sweetness hits you from the start. There’s a hint of alcohol and slight tingle. Raisen starts to take over at the end which is the sherry influence. 

The finish: Very much raisen. It’s pleasantly sweet and bitter at the same time. Chocolate creeps on and blends with the raisenin.. like the 90% cocoa dark chocolate bars that leave that dry yet appetizing lust for more.

This is one of the most balanced sherried scotches I’ve tasted and is a testament to what a perfectly crafted sherried scotch can be. I’ll be keeping this one in stock for sure."

4.25,"Rich honey, vanilla, and citrus fruits are the most prominent tasting notes. Mouth feel is viscous, and coats the palate. Perhaps a bit of a grassy after taste. The aroma is overwhelmingly sweet, but smooth, and not a sickly sweetness. Honey, butterscotch, and citrus are first on the nose, then vanilla and maybe some apple. I’m not able to find any smoke on the nose or palate."

3.25,"Lots of raisin, sherry and orange on the nose. The ex bourbon casks really come out on the palate along with cherry and honey. Fairly viscous so that is pleasant. Finish is long and sherry sweet. I give a 3.25 because I am a peat head so something like this could never be above a 3.5 for me, but it will be a treat to have at my bar for most other guests who don’t share my view on peat!

My scale..

2- Senior year off campus stock
3- First year out of college stock
4- Now we’re talking
5- I’d rather just look and admire than drink it"

4.0,"If I was given this I could mistake it for a bourbon. Noses of brown sugar, vanilla, grass, and some honey. On the tongue it has an oakey quality with some floral and finishes into a spicy. If I wanted to introduce bourbon drinks to scotch this would be the whisky I would use. Overall a decent sipper."

3.75,"The nose is essentially fruitcake with a bit of scotchy scent to it. It has some nice subtlety and a mild flavor that is still rich. It tastes somewhere between Macallan 12 and Macallan 15. There is some nice sweet cherry that is subdued by butterscotchy caramel. A little bit of cocoa comes through and a tad of woody richness. The spice is minimal, but there is a little harshness from the alcohol. There's a little bit of cinnamon and also plenty of raisins and prunes. It's tasty with a decent amount of complexity and some nice hedonistic sweetness. It's an easy sipper, but it isn't exemplary. Ultimately, it's fruity and sweet but without a young naivette. Really, it's quite good."
