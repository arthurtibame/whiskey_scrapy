3.0,"Good not great. Tasted it neat at a restaurant while eating a spicy chicken taco. In the being I tasted the mulled spices. After cleaning my palette some I could taste the wine and port barrel finishing. It had a licorice taste that hung on my tongue. I could definitely taste the rye. 
You taste results may differ."
