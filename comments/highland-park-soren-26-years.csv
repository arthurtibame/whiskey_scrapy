5.0,"This is a masterful scotch.  On the nose you get sweet fruits, like pear, orange, flowers... the aroma is intoxicating.  On the palate more sweetness, fruity, bananas, vanilla, grapes and rich body.  The finish is smooth, medium lasting and more fruits.  I got this in a Scotch tasting, so I am going to make it last for as long as possible."
