4.5,No second glance needed here for this baller whiskey. It’s so good it’s easy to drink too much and stand up for your second amendment rights

4.0,"I wouldn’t mind getting a little more of that Napa Cab on the finish, but this is a smooth whiskey of quality that I’d be more than happy to have on my shelf!"
5.0,"Good roundness on palate, caramel & wood notes, perfect with 6 drops of water"

3.5,A little hot for a 88 proof. Wish it was had more red wine in the finish. Feels like it has a touch but not enough of a good can finish.
2.5,was just ok
4.0,Boring... but finishes with a flavor reminiscent of spiced gum drops

2.25,"Youthful, watery, sweet."
3.75,Very very smooth. Doesn’t do anything to really push it to stand out but it is great for the money. Great value for a great every day drinker!
3.0,"Decent for the money. Not very bold. A outta medicinal but good flavor notes wood, nuts and Carmel."
2.0,Very spicy on the front end.

1.75,"Received as a gift— nose is a bit muted and palate is nutty with the obvious wine finish, a not-so-tasty PBJ sandwich that I’d probably trade away for in a middle-school cafeteria."

3.75,"Sort of paradoxical, both smooth and fiery. Nice bourbon flavor, yet with a lingering warm aftertaste more like a rye whiskey. Good bang for the buck."
4.0,A good whiskey.  Not special really in any way.
