4.5,"Look: Burnt orange, considering this is a ten year whiskey, I figured it would be darker. There’s lacing and plenty of alcohol legs dripping after swirling. A really clear looking spirit. 

Nose: Some pretty good rye notes, dark bread, slight dill notes, clove, brown sugar.   There’s also what I think is a woody note throughout the all the notes.

Palette: way more impressive than the nose was leading me to believe, Whistle Pig 10 is initially pretty sweet up front, vanilla with  the rye bread, and baking spices/clove hitting initially, and really lasting until some barrel notes mix in. 

Finish: Oaky, slight pepper in the finish, but a pretty long lasting intense, then changing to more rye bread notes. After a few minutes, the taste really reminds me of what I can only relate to musty produce. Just a real earthy flavor. 

Overall: The nose initially led me to believe this would be disappointing, but after trying Whistle Pig 10, I can see why this rye is sought after. Not sure I can justify the price tag, but Whistle Pig is still a great rye."

3.75,"Time to get the standard 10-100 WP on the record.  This is a rye I've had a number of times, mostly at bars and a couple of belts from friends bottles, it's always been good and also a rye that's just a little hard to pin down. 

Whistlepig is now as iconic as about any bottle, largely due to the massive boost in exposure from the tv show(breakingbad) it is becoming much more of a standard shelf item with the 10- 12 - 15 years and farmstock common place now.  Well known as a ""pricey"" bottle of good rye we now reach the age old question of ""but is it as good as the price?"" 

Nose:  Great loads of rye spices including ginger, pumpernickel and allspice, feint pumpkin sweetness and orange rind as well, from the nose alone, clearly there is ""something here"" worth looking at. 

Front:  Extra peppery heat, musty aged oak. by adding a few drops of water I got a little more including some caramel and red hot sugars however much of the spectrum found in the nose is simply missing on the tongue or stepped on by the hi-heat.   Over all a good drink of rye but just a bit thin in the middle for me. 

Finish:  hot pepper oak and grains or maybe some grain chaff from the barn along with some of the spice profile linger on,  Whistle Pig is a rye that announces itself and leaves with a well marked, ""rye's been here"". 

Push comes to shove, if I had this bottle on the shelf for say 40 or 50$,  I would say yes, this is a good rye with some interesting qualities but for the near 80$ most retailers are asking I can easily find something like a Knob Creek or Russells that I can enjoy at the same level maybe even better.    The straight rye drinkers will probably get more mileage from the hard packed pepper heat and lack of middle sweetness, the average bourbon whiskey drinker is unlikely to find it as rewarding.

For me Whistle Pig isn't bad, it's in fact a good rye, but living up to the hype as well as the pricing standards, well that's entirely different.   There are any number of ""hyped"" rye labels, Willet,  Kentucky Owl, Peerless, to name but a few, but when you have far thriftier options like Woodford, Knob, even Bullet and Redemption around, you don't have to kill a Benjamin just to find a good sip of rye. 

If you want to have a complete bar of good rye bottles sure you want at least A Whistle Pig, but as an economic minded drinker you don't really need to worry about it.   Adding the 12-15, Boss Hog and even the new Piggyback will make for interesting comparison but this is the standard WP product."

4.0,"Being a bourbon man, I have not had much experience with rye whiskey and I have not yet purchased a bottle of rye for home. Thanks to the good folks over at Flaviar, I was provided with a bottle of WhistlePig 10 Year Straight Rye for purchasing a membership (side note: Don't bother joining Flaviar, it is a scam masquerading as a rip off). I knew WhistlePig is a respected a sought after brand and that 10 years makes a good whiskey, but outside those two bits of information, I knew nothing of what I was in for. I poured it neat into a Glencairn glass and braced myself. 

I don't know what the typical notes of rye should be, but I noticed a sweet mint smell, caramel, perhaps faint banana, and an earthy undertone (Is that the rye? Is rye earthy? I'm out of my depth here, someone help me). The mouthfeel was silky smooth and I knew immediately that if I had enough money I would fill up a bathtub with this stuff and luxuriate in it all night. The palate has brown sugar, pecan, and vanilla upfront with plenty of baking spices and orange in the back. Made with 100% rye, there is certainly a kick on the way down that is stronger than the bourbon I am used to, but it is nice. The finish is long and warm with tobacco and leather and a nice spice lingering in my gums (if this is unusual, please let me know so I can contact a dental professional as soon as possible). I don't know if staring with a 100% rye mash bill was the best introduction to rye that I could have chosen, but I did like this one and it has certainly opened the door to further exploration of the category. I can't compare it to other ryes or what a rye ""should"" be, so my rating is simply based on my experience with the label. A good experience, indeed."
4.25,"Working with 100% rye is notoriously difficult and Whistle Pig has done an outstanding job with this rye. This 10 year and the 12 year from Whistle Pig are both permanent fixtures in my rotation. When I want what I consider to be the prototype rye flavor and heat I always reach for the Whistle Pig 10 year.

4.0,"Haven’t been able to pull the trigger on $75 bottles of rye so when I saw the $4.99 minis at Walmart liquor it was a no-brainer for me. Bought a few of them to keep around and gift to bourbon friends also. 

So this is my first WhistlePig product and the first rye I’ve had in a while (been sticking to straight bourbon lately). So with that info out of the way, here’s my thoughts....

Well I’m fairly impressed at how good this is. The flavor profile is very spicy rye and if you’re into that, this nails that profile. At first sip I wasn’t feeling it but remember I haven’t been drinking ryes lately. After my initial few small sips I was really digging it. The flavor lingers for a loooong time on my tongue. Smooth is not a descriptor I would use because it is a bit harsh but mainly due to the abundance of rye. Harsh in a good way. There are a lot of vanilla tones to it that stick around. And it certainly has a profile all its own that I’ve not had before. Certainly a unique profile that I enjoyed.

My verdict is that, yes, if I had a disposable income and was capable to purchase this occasionally at $75/bottle I’d probably have one in the cabinet at all times. But alas, here I am buying $4.99 minis at Walmart. Can’t wait to finish my MBA so I can spend more on my whiskey habit!"

3.75,"I've been wanting to try some WP products for a while, and I saw this in the mini-section behind the counter today. It's a Friday and I figured it was as good a time as any to treat myself. ($6.99 for 50 ml)

Nose: Musty grass/hay for days, and a ton of cracked black pepper. Sweetness shows up after a bit, the closest I can get is a creamy vanilla vibe.

Taste: A rush of flavor instantly. Sugar (waves of it) starts you off and transitions into this herbal bitterness. Pipe tobacco. Rye bread. Dry barrel notes as well.

Finish: It’s dry, but it packs a punch and it lingers. There’s a harshness from the rye, but some sweet citrus notes show up at the end to give it a very pleasant balance. 

Overall: I find myself being very hit or miss on Rye. This isn’t my preference with flavor profiles, but I can appreciate it as being very high quality. Complex, rich and just interesting overall. It’s enough to get me trying some other Whistle Pig products."

4.0,"Had a couple of pours of this at a restaurant/pub tonight on the company dime. First time trying a WP product. I gotta say it was pretty damn good. 

This is a 100% rye aged in new American oak and finished in used bourbon barrels. It’s bottled at 50% ABV. This tasting was a neat pour in a rocks glass. 

The nose was sweet and spicy. Hard to get much more out of it but there was almost no alcohol burn. The palate was  light caramel, honey, and baking spices. The finish was fairly long with lots of rye spice and oak char. There was a faint hint of dill in the finish long after the sip. Very easy drinking for 100 proof. 

This bottle can be had for $65 online. Based on this tasting I’d say that’s reasonable, but I wouldn’t pay much more. I might have to think about getting a bottle of this one of these days. 4/5. Cheers!"

4.25,"Never had a 100% rye so was very interested in this. Its from Canada so maybe that impacts the %. 10 yr age statement is much appreciated. Poured neat, nice thick glasscoat. Nose is sweet bubblegum, bread dough, baking spices, banana peel, tea leaf, dill and barrel oak. Ethanol is mild even at 100pf. Don't worry the proof makes itself known on the palate. Powerful heated blast of sweet gum and dusty spice with oaky vanilla and cooling mint. Strong but very smooth delivery. Finish is buttery oak, savory spice with mild drying cinnamon and mint. Its worth the pricetag and damned good rye. If your not sure you like rye get your hands on some of this.........92/100.......great depth of delicious flavor"

4.25,"Medium strength aroma featuring a berry and apple fruitiness that is close to the smell of Fruity Pebbles cereal, honey, orange, pine, cedar, and green tea. Ethanol does singe the nostrils if you get too close. 

Full flavored on the palate. Honey, vanilla, and caramel upfront followed by basil, mint, and herbal tea in the mid, leading to a long peppery finish. Make no mistake; that 100% rye makes it's presence known; this sucker is hot. After the pepper and heat fade, when you think there's nothing else to be had, there's a whisper of the berry fruitiness found in the nose which I really loved. Especially viscous mouthfeel for 100 proof. 

Overall, unique and quite delicious. Haven't tasted this profile in any of the other rye's I have sampled. At $70 hard to call this a great value, but it sure doesn't suck."

A strong sweet oak with just a touch of smoke.

Still aged 10 years and my bottle is from batch A/354. This bottle exceeded my expectations a lot and I am so glad I took the chance given some mediocre reviews I’ve read."

4.0,"This rye whiskey had a copper color with thicker oily legs.

The nose was overall sweet and sour with notes of peach, pear, red apple, honey, strawberry Twizzler, dusty corn, sweet tarts, and a note I can unfortunately only describe as gym sweat.

The palate had a velvety mouthfeel, with notes of blue cheese, green apple, red grape, citrus, cinnamon, and rye spiciness.

The finish was medium length with a pineapple and grape skin aftertaste.

Rye is a whiskey category that I am finding is quite diverse. This particular rye was very different from others I’ve had but so good! I had this one when my fellow distillers and I had a night out at a whiskey bar after work, and I would definitely recommend! Whistlepig, thanks! Cheers!"

4.75,"So, I'm definitely not one for rye whiskies and the reason is because I haven't had a rye whiskey that tastes like this one does.  This is just beautiful.  It's so pretty.  It's not weak by any means, but it's just wonderfully complex and balanced.  It's just so different than anything I've had.  On the nose, this beautiful wood and spice note comes through.  I know this is vague, but hopefully this helps.  Every year, when my family goes to get a Christmas tree we go to this place owned by a local farmer who specializes in woodworkings and fruits.  The smell in his shop is that of shaved wood, homemade apple cider with fresh cinnamon, and freshly-picked produce.  This is what this whiskey tastes like.  It's so welcoming with its smooth spiced apple and light shaved wood flavors.  I had no idea a rye could taste like this.  If I had to have a comparison, it reminds me of the Jefferson's Ocean, both in terms of mouthfeel/light-heartedness as well as the wood influence.  The flavors are, otherwise, rather different for obvious reasons.  This is just so majestic.  I just love drinking it and I seriously recommend it to anyone who isn't a huge fan of rye, because this will change your mind."

2.75,"My first rye and I figured to do some research on what was popular in the whiskey community as a good go to rye. So here I am buying Whistlepig, a bottle  around $73 and I have to say, I paid too much. The nose is nice on this one, sorta sweet that turns into a green apple. The taste is spiky, bitter, their are hints of sweetness that show up but it goes away very quickly, as you swallow you get a nice alcohol burn that turns into a grassy aftertaste. If this is a good representation of rye whiskey, I have admit, I'm not a fan, or if I ever bought into rye whiskey I definitely have to be in the mood for a rye. $73 bottle of rye whiskey? If rye is your thing, then more power to you! I won't buy another bottle of rye whiskey, I guess education is expensive."

3.75,"I was excited to find a taster of this at Total Wine the other day. Usually these ""premium"" products don't debase themselves with miniatures. Those of you who've read my reviews know I'm not a huge fan of American Rye, but that I don't mind Canadian Rye, which makes up at least a portion of this blend. What shall we find?

The nose is shy. Leans more in the Canadian direction than American. A bit dusty, some spice, vanilla and butterscotch. I stuck my nose all the way in the glass and other than a ""screw you that's not how you nose whisky"" burst of ethanol, I can't divine much else. On the palate, it enters smooth and gentle. The mid-palate has a burst of rye spice and some heat too. It does not drink like a 50 proof dram. Repeated tastes give off  more of a coating mouthfeel, some tobacco, a puff of smoke, and the slightest hint of barrel bitter. 

I'm amazed at how smooth and approachable this dram is. There's some masterful blending going on here (this was a Dave Pickerel project [RIP], so I'm not surprised. I also wouldn't be surprised if there's whisky older than 10 years in this blend, which would certainly justify the high price for a bottle). The finish is quite long and luxurious, with some more caramel and butterscotch. A fine sipping rye, but I can also see it playing well in cocktails against more sour and bitter elements.

So what to say. I want to give this a 4 based on the nosing and tasting, but the retails at around $80, which is about $40-$50 more than I'm willing to pay for rye, and I don't even like rye most of the time. This is a beautiful whisky, and I would not say no if someone offered it to me. There's some older Canadian Rye in here for sure with how easy this is to drink. Most rye's I drink fight back, even Lot 40 (which is a more complex AND more affordable rye IMO). If it weren't for the price, it would be 4, but factoring the exorbitant price, I'm gonna have to go 3.75. I know some of you who read are big rye fans, and should definitely seek this one out to sip. If you're more of a casual rye drinker, or a ""fine, if I have to"" rye drinker like me, then go for something more affordable like Lot 40 or Canadian Club 100% Rye.  Cheers!"
4.25,"This is my first Rye after having some reserves about a Rye whiskey and this absolutely disappointed me because I was wrong. This is great. On the nose I get sweet sweet honey and a bit of caramelizedgreen apple. I know honey is sweet but, I had to exaggerate the sweet because of how amazingly sweet this is on the nose after my personal thoughts based on reviews on Rye whiskey. So on the taste I get a bit of ginger bread with of course spice and the spice definitely shows up on the finish and the finish is medium. Definitely be buying this again."

4.5,"Been a while since I have had this and it was time to sit and contemplate with a glass.  I continue to fall more in love with Rye every month.  Bright Copper Amber in Color. Distinctive Rye Aroma with some grain noted. Vanilla and vanilla spice as well.  All-spice or maybe clove.  As it opens the vanilla takes center stage.  Flavor is much spicier than the nose hinted. Nice complexity, orange peel, all baking spices, perhaps a hint of Dill.  Vanilla and sweetness near the finish. Spice lingers and provides a beautiful finish.  I get this moment of lime peel twice in the glass.  Touch of water is nice here. Spice pops in flavor along with vanilla and more caramel on the finish. Citrus head to the rear.  Really nice and I raised my score even as I typed this.  I'll be back!"

I went rummaging through stored stuff and found one and away I went. It was definitely worth paying respect to the dram by serving it right, tasting straight and adding water and retrying. I wouldn't say i'm a huge fan of the profile these days preferring scotch style whisky but this is a rye done well. Nice spicey earthy notes, well balanced and handles water very well in fact even with liberal watering i couldn't really tell the difference. It seems to handle a wide abv range well."
