4.0,"The millet is a little odd. Almost sour, like dill pickles, but with a rich earthiness - newly sown mulch? Salt on the nose. Short finish, leaves you wanting more. 

Good to try, but not sure it's worth folding into the regular rotation."

4.0,"4/13/15. At DMK, in vibrant northern Chicago, this glass was a sip of smooth bliss after a LONG day of science speak. Caramel, toasty cereal and malty sweetness with a hint of wood spice afterburn. I only wish it was more complex, but simple whiskeys have a place in my home."

2.0,"I don't know that I've ever hated a bourbon more than this one. The aroma reminded me more of gasoline than of anything resembling a drink I'd want twice in my lifetime. Between the wife and I, good bourbon doesn't survive for very long. Our bottle of Koval regularly gets called Abe Vigoda by the other bottles that move much more quickly in our collection."

Finish- more oak and spices vanilla and floral.

All in all I really had to search for the flavors but this being higher proof it's still very smooth. the wood over takes the flavor and the whiskey coats the tongue immediately. Not very complex at all but not a bad whiskey."

The palate feels rich at first but quickly turns dry, as all of the sweet notes coat the mouth adding pleasant creaminess to the mouthfeel. The millet doesn’t make itself distinct but you can tell there is no rye or malted barely in this whiskey. The finish is somewhat short and releases some baking spices and buttery notes that linger while all of the sweetness quickly fades."

4.5,"In summary, which I will do at the beginning as well as the end of this review, this is a stunning, fun to drink, juicy and sweet bourbon. I am generally not a fan of Bourbons perhaps because of the mash bill that emphasizes a spiciness and the Char of white oak barrels. But this one, along with Maker's Mark could be daily drinkers for me.

 LOL, if I could afford this one. I honestly don't know the price because I bought it as a 3-pack of 200 ml. bottles-- rye, bourbon and one other whiskey I don't recall at the moment. Hell, it was a weekend of Chicago Whiskey Fest in March 2018, how much of that could I possibly remember?? All were excellent!

Right off the bat, and a 47% ABV bottling, there's the usual bourbon turpentine, furniture polish, cherry wood furniture stain... All of this adds to the complexity and delights, not making it gross or chemical-smelling (other than wafts of bourbon-tainted ethanol) in any significant way. Certainly the alcohol is strong. But I have no desire to dilute this, the flavor is intense and delightful!

It must be the corn and Millet together, I wish more Bourbons or whiskeys of any sort used this mix. It would vastly enhance the taste and probably increase the customer base. (Women tend to enjoy sweeter drinks-- and cinnamon flavored whiskey, as well as brandy like Hot Damn is a hot seller among women, I hear.)

On to my review of the taste, which will be grossly insufficient due to my infamously coarse palate:

There is a richness and sweetness that does not resolve into specific tastes, though dates, mangoes and mild citrus fruits like kiwi come to mind.

Certainly the sweetness bears a resemblance to toffee and for some reason I want to keep on drinking and drinking and drinking this. They have done *something* right, although I cannot pinpoint the exact dimensions and contents and methods of their incredibly wiley alchemy, expressed as bourbon distilling perfection!

Let me admit this as a final perhaps fatal flaw in my taste buds, if only to entertain bourbon aficionados: I gave up my Chicago Whiskey Fest tasting pour, (the booth towards which hundreds literally ran!) the remainder of the Pappy Van Winkle 23-year old Family Reserve to my friend--because it essentially did *nothing* great for me. I knew he would enjoy it and for a whiskey that sells currently at $2,800-$4000 a bottle, my lack of appreciation was almost a crime! 

In praise of Koval, I would trade, if based on taste alone (certainly I would make an investment calculation in the real world!) that 23 y.o. Pappy for half a bottle of Koval bourbon! That's how damn freaking good this stuff is!

Okay, it may be faint praise for Koval from an (evident) ""sherryhead"" with only three to four years intensive whiskey tasting experience. Be that as it may, should this whiskey gain a widespread audience, it could surpass Maker's Mark as THE entry level whiskey for bourbon beginners, and perhaps help create an entire new, expanding market for bourbon that omitts rye and adds varying levels of complexity, variation and sweetness,  based in this case on millet, grain I find far more appealing (mostly because it's sweeter) than the rye portion of the mash bill in most bourbons."

3.75,"Nose: Chocolate, orange peel, caramels, burnt marshmallows. It's like a fruity burnt smore.

Taste: hints of caramel and sour apples, with a strong cereal or cake batter body ending very quickly in a smokey citrus.

Experience: I've never eaten fruit with s'mores, or even by a campfire at all. But that is the direction it takes. It's not a bad ride, but a short one for sure. The proof feels lower than it is."

Overall I find this bourbon very enjoyable and a nice change from other bourbons. Maybe the millet and lack of rye coming in here. Certainly would recommend!"
