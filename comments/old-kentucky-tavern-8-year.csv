4.25,"‘63/‘71. Almost like a port on the nose. You know this is going to be chewy. Molasses. A surprising oak on the tongue. Swallow and breathe opens up delightful amounts of oak, butter and butterscotch. So much oak and sawdust. Love. Light on finish, long on history."
4.0,"The nose is aromatic of dried oak, dried flowers, cinnamon, molasses, dried fruit and a hint of mint. The palate is dry, oaky and peppery along with cinnamon, cooked caramel, cherry syrup, dried fruit and a touch of vanilla. The finish is medium with lasting cinnamon that keeps the mouth tingling as the oak and cherry blend and fade nicely."
