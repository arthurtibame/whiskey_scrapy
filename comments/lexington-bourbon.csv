3.0,Not alot going on here. I admit I bought this bad boy simply based on the label...what a label. First sip was promising. Vanilla. A little oak? Then...nothin. No down slope. No finish.  Perhaps I'm being a bit rough. The label tag claims this bourban earned a 96 score on some tasting panel.  I wasn't on that panel.

1.0,Working my way through a list t of value bourbons.  This bourbon was prices right and  had a nice bottle.  The taste wasn't very distinctive.  It wasn't bad but wasn't strong or memorable.  I'm not sure the price warrants the purchase vs slightly more expensive bourbons

3.0,The blackberry flavor got my attention.  A little on the sweeter side

2.0,Most unremarkable bourbon  I have ever had.  Only good for mixing.  Pour it into some cola to give is flavor.  Won't buy again.

2.0,"Not memorable in any tasting way. It is bourbon, but there's nothing special about it. I did hear the dirty rumor that this bourbon's bottle shape was heavily inspired by Woodford Reserve."
1.0,Very little flavor here. A tiny bit of oakiness. I won't buy it again.

3.0,Nice bourbon for the price.  Sweet at the front with a bit off alcohol burn in the finish when neat.  Easy to drink but nothing special on the rocks.

1.0,"Don't let the horse on the label or the Woodford Reserve-ish bottle shape FOAL you. This bourbon is a nightMARE. There's no information on this bourbon because no one wants to take credit for it. I say ""NEIGH"" to this."

3.0,"I bought this bottle due to the price, $24.99 and the 95 point rating it received. Once I got home I was disappointed to see the negative reviews it received, thinking that I wasted $25. I think it's okay...I've certainly had better but by no means is it terrible. It lacks serious flavor and a meaningful after taste. Immediately I made the association that this belongs to the B-team of bourbons. Certainly not a top performer but does an okay job. That said, I'm glad I gave it a try but would not buy it again"
1.0,"This is the worst, thinnest bourbon I've ever tasted.   I'd would be disappointed if I paid $15.   I paid $30 and am mad at myself for taking a chance on a nice looking bottle.  unless you're desperate and get it for $10, there's way better options."

2.0,It's got good flavor but it's SUPER hot and has this one little bit of spice that singes your lips that's not overly pleasant.
3.0,"JBT #2

Muted nose, but notes of caramel and red apple.

Tastes mostly of black pepper, rubber, and sweetness of cherry"

2.0,Drank Booker then this. It didn’t compare so I’m sure it influenced my thoughts on this but over all it was very average.  Other much less expensive bourbons are better.  Skip this one.
