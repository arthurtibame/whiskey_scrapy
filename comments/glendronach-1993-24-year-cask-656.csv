5.0,"I have finally opened one of my ""really wonderful"" bottles, and i did it because my wife is pregnant with my first child; And after 19 weeks we found out it is going to be a baby boy! (A milk Critic!) So i asked my wife to select a bottle i should drink (not one drop for her) and she picked the Glendronach 1993, Single Cask, Sherry Butt, 52.4% abv, Cask 401. 

And it was superb. Like one of the best whiskies ever. Very much alike the Glendronach i got to bottle at their distillery. So sweet, so perfect.

Ok, lets do this:

On the nose: perfect. Cherries at first. Superb chocolate, hazelnut, almonds, winey, coffee beans, dulce de leche, milk powder, chocolate milk powder, waffer, and after a few sips an orange caramel appears. Just amazing. It is a fancy chocolate bar.

On the palate is outstanding. Very sweet with a touch of bitterness. Chocolate, waffer, dulce de leche, chocolate powder, Millefeuille.

Aftertaste is just out of this world. It is spicy but chocolaty, oak spice, chocolate, ginger infusion to your mouth, a very slight salt note, like one small salt grain, it is madness made whisky.

Overall this just might be the best whisky ever made. It is said that 1993 was the best year for glendronach and it is easy to know why. You should grab any expression of that year and enjoy it. Don't share it, NOBODY DESERVES THIS MORE THAN YOU, AND YOU ALONE. 100/100 SLAINTE MHATH!!!"
3.0,"Yeah... It's alright. Not great considering the price. It's complex though. Just not the right type of complexity - like someone who's bipolar and not taking their medication. 😏

Green tea and dates, with some almond paste. It's sweet and bitter at the same time."
