2.0,When you only pay $20 for a bottle you don't expect much. This is surprisingly sippable with a unique smokey flavor.

4.0,An everyday Scotch. Inexpensive enough that don't feel bad drinking it everyday but not so cheap it tastes like swill

3.0,Lovely sweet and rich flavour with a hint of smoke in the aftertaste. Good price for a single malt at $45.15 @ the LCBO.

3.25,"Odor: 
Simple and not very overpowering, limited smoke. 

Taste:
More sweet than smooth, lacking the expected Speyside bite and smoke. Still, a good job balancing the bitterness of cheaper whisky. 

Finish: 
Not unpleasant, but little in the way of distinct flavors."

3.25,"Tasted neat.

Nose:
Melted butter and honey. Notes of vanilla. Smells inviting.

Arrival:
Sweet and salty, but mostly sweet. Reminiscent of dried fruit. Black pepper and toffee are in there as well. The arrival is less interesting than the odor.

Finish:
The sweetness goes, leaving a slightly bitter taste. Brings citrus rind and cinnamon to mind. Once that's gone there's a slightly smokey aftertaste that lingers for a while.

Overall it's not a bad dram but it doesn't stand out much either. Inoffensive, and enough different notes to peak the interest of a new scotch drinker. For 45.00 CAD, I'd say you're getting about what you pay for."

3.0,"Very sweet like candy butterscotch and creamy on the nose, grainy and woodsy with a hint of citrus on the palate"
2.75,Cheap and peaty
3.5,"Neat, at home: Terrific for the price point. SALTY at the top, the burn is but a flesh wound. METALLIC/battery; vanilla creme; an oak CIGAR BOX; dried hay; apricot and dried ORANGE PEEL, but without the prickly spice; almonds. 

The vanilla keeps coming with a dash of water. The finish is white pepper, and a touch of cinnamon. It's very mild and easy to drink, sweet, spicy and salty."
