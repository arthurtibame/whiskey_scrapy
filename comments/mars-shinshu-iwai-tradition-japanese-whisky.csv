3.0,The amount of fruit on the nose held so much promise but let down in the palate delivery.

4.0,Smooth. Lightly smokey. Well-rounded. No water needed.
5.0,I fell in love with the iwai traditional at our whisky club tasting  a while back. matured in 4 different casks bourbon sherry American oak & mizunara oak. It is a pleasure to drink from nose to finish. On the nose you get sherry sweetness fruits & a hint of peat the palate brings a complex variety of flavours again sherry fruits more woody oak than peat & cedar/cigar ( this might sound wierd but the i get a little reminded of the smell of my humidor from the taste) but again ever so slight the finish is medium to long. One of my favorite NAS japanese whiskies

3.0,"Nose : sweet, peat, fruity, plum, a bit of oak. 

Taste : again sweet, some smoke, fruity but subtle.

3.5,"As I continue my exploration into Japanese Whiskey I now have the pleasure of trying out the Iwai Mars Blended Whiskeys. I initially had a taste of the standard offering (blue label) and it was far to light for me. I passed on a pour. I then got a taste of this one and it was noticably richer and decided to pull the trigger on a full pour. 
On the pallette it's all tropical fruit notes. Ripe bananas with a hint of lychee. Mid pallette has a malt chocolate note with slight oak spice leading to a medium charred oak finish. It's all very delicate. I would recommend this one to a Bourbon drinker like myself. No smoke or peat that typically is a turn off (although I am learning to love it now!). It's got complexity and some Bourbonesque notes with the exotic fruits! 
Looking this one up, it's in the $55 range for a bottle and it's worth it. I still think Nikka from the Barrel is the best I have had by far, but I think this is a bit better than Toki sipped neat. I personally really disliked Nikka Pure Malt and both of their Coffey expressions. 
If that resonates with you, it's worth seeking a pounding out on this one. Cheers all!"

4.0,This is a flavor bomb. I’d pretty much agree with the flavor notes. Try this with a splash of water and a bit of chocolate or toffee. Marvelous. I received this as a gift last week from a colleague .. very impressed.

3.75,"Another one of my choices for this month's whiskey club!

Nose:  Old leather, strawberries, brown paper bags?  Subtle smoke, like the smoke from the coals of a campfire the morning after.  Black pepper, beef jerky made with a sweet brine, and some wet moss.  Fresh cracked pepper, raisin cake, somehow reminds me of Sichuan pepper.

Palate:  Tingly and sweet.  A small bit of peppercorn kick, charred oak and sawdust.  creamy vanilla with smoke and brine.  Small amounts of other muddled spices, light floral-ish peat smoke (if that's a thing), and ever so slightly medicinal.

Finish:  Medium-long.  Lots of oak, vanilla cream, and even some earthy greens.  The peat lingers for quite a while.

Conclusion:  I'm pleasantly surprised by this!  I didn't know what to expect from a cheaper Japanese blend, but this is actually really enjoyable.  One of those whiskies that changes with every sip.  It's a great example of a lightly peated whiskey in which you can easily pick apart the different components without that big blast of smoke.  I love peat, but it can be hard to pick a peaty one for my whiskey club because I don't want to overwhelm anyone - this was a great choice though!"

3.25,"Odor:
Dark, deep, and earthy. Some wine and oak mixed in. Individual odors are difficult to ascertain, but the mix lingers a while. 

 Taste: 
Starts off sweet on the sides of the tongue, mellow in the middle. The earthiness continues - not what I was expecting, but pleasant nonetheless. Very little spice overall. Musty earthy flavor predominates.  

Finish: 
Leaves the distinct flavor of basement air. Numbs the roof of my mouth, but not too bad. Cereal taste sticks around for a while. Wine flavors toward the back of the throat."

4.0,"Nose; strange wooded nose, almost a hint of varnish. Here comes that sherry barrel. Some vanilla as well. I get the wine barrel as well. 
Taste; The sweetness dominates at first. Reminds me of the Super Nikka as it hits the tongue. But it’s very different. Its sweet and smooth, and the oak balances the malt well. It flees of the tongue fairly quickly. The triple casking makes a confused flavour profile. It isn’t layered, it all just melds together. I don’t get any peat or smoke in here. It’s nice, I like it, but I think the asking price is steep for the quality of whiskey."
