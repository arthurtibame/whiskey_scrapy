2.0,Not bad for the price. But not great either. Much better when chilled. I give it 2.5 whiskey dicks out of 10.

1.0,The bottle I purchased noted that it had been aged five years. Unimpressed by this whiskey.

1.0,"Distilled in KY, bottled in FL. Someone else's lesser effort? Firmly on my lowest shelf."
1.0,Thin and apparently from the taste a young whisky. I bought it because of the bottle and it is bottled in my home state. Hopefully this brand gets better over time but at this point it is a mixer for me.
