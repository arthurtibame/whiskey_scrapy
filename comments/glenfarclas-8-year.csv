Sweet with a hint of nutty, cinnamon, and pear.
Opens up well.

4.0,"Complex and mature for something so young.

The sherry influence is definite, with cooked plums and walnut on the nose and palate. The low ABV is my main criticism here, because something higher would have created something truly magical. 

Excellent whisky."
