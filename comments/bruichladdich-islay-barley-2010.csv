4.25,"Distilled in 2010 and bottled in 2017 this 6 year old unpeated single malt is exemplary. Young, malt forward and unapologetic, a fine example of the intrinsic quality that Bruichladdich has brought to the market. They have raised the bar for single malt whisky and it is doubtful that other producer's would dare to rise to this challenge. Thank you Bruichladdich!"

5.0,"Tried this at whiskey washback. Very Good stuff with notes of vanilla, caramel, brine, salt, and spice. Takes on the islay sea without the peat."
4.0,"4.25 one of the better recent single malt finds. Butter, toffee, vanilla, caramel, rich but also light....sweet/cake on the nose"
4.0,"To begin, I almost feel like I could notice a very faint wiff of the rubberiness similar to what's in the Port Charlottes. I'm told this is likely barrel char coming through. A few more smells and I start to get a mix of barley sugars and lemon peel. More of the same when tasting- and extra lemon. The 50%abv doesn't come across as heavy. This was a small taste of a newly opened bottle...I feel like it will get better with time. 3.5 stars for now....I've started to really enjoy this one now 3 1/2 to 4 stars."
3.0,"Bruichladdich is one of the leading proponents of the idea that the provenance of your whisky ingredients matter and this release aims to showcase barley sourced from a local farm on Islay. It’s light and lemony, with a long citrus finish. How much of that is due to the barley rather than the many other variables in its production I cannot say, but it’s delicious and worthy of 3.5 stars."

3.25,"Salty peat and pastry dough in the nose, with a touch of icing and green apple.  Flavor is sweet and dominated by golden fruits.  Peat makes an appearance on the fairly lingering finish.  Honestly, overall, it tastes young and under-developed, with a bit of a moonshine element.  Mouth feel is thin too."
4.0,"caramel, raisin, citrus, salt. overall on the sweeter side"

3.0,Very harsh and taste of alcohol at first. Similar to a mescal. Mellows out to a sweet salty flavor.

4.25,Almost a dessert Scotch. All the same character of Bruichladdich Islay malt but with the complexity and sweetness from the three French wine casks finishing it. Refreshing but not boring.

P: Salted caramel, citrus zest, brine, baking spice, toffee.

A breezy, coastal, complex dram from a really intriguing distillery."

4.25,"Love me some Bruichladdich! Distilled in 2010, bottled in 2017. Awesome packaging and lovely presentation of the whisky. Lovely sea breeze on the nose, makes you feel like you're at the beach on a windy day. The palate has grilled lemons with black pepper and sea salt. You catch a hint of the wine casks used on the finish combined with brine and again some black pepper. Really impressive stuff for such a young whisky. Love the transparency of Bruichladdich. I definitely recommend this one, cheers all."

3.75,Not nearly as fruity as the classic. Still very smooth with a long (but harsher) finish. I’m having trouble distinguishing the exact flavors I’m getting

4.0,"Hot nose with a lemon sweetness. Still very malty. Palate has toffee and caramel sweetness, with a bit of a bite at the back of the throat. Floral and malty, it kinda reminds me of glenfiddich fire and cane."
3.0,Heavy barley - more like an America whiskey than a scotch
3.5,A great taste for an unleaded scotch. The barley is front and center. A tasty cereal that isn’t too sweet.
3.25,"Musty citrus, caramel, nutmeg, banana. Pretty hot going down. Can feel the abv."
4.75,"Very bright and sweet and friendly, with no mustiness weighing it down like you might get in a speyside. The flavor is a backbone of grains, honey, and maple syrup, but if you swirl it around in your mouth, you’ll taste just about every fruit in existence bouncing in and out of the flavor profile. There’s also a notable bit of black peppery earthiness to offset the sweetness.

Bonus guest review from my friend: “This is what I imagine scotch would taste like if I liked scotch.” Take that how you will."
