3.75,Excellent wheater bourbon but DAMN the recent price hike to $50 and the supply going from treasure hunt to good luck is just stupid. Hype has made a damn good bourbon not worth the BS.

4.0,"Bottle pour neat in Sutherland tasting glass courtesy of Cousin Lane, who found it 9/10ths full in his late grandfather's old stash.  Had it been unopened, looking at a 4 digit profit on the market.  As it is, we ended up getting an exceptional opportunity at tasting history.  Bottle looks exactly like the one for this listing, gold veins and so forth, but showing more age.  Really cool.

Extremely smooth, with caramel and apple peel, no discernible heat despite the proof.  A real treat.  Thanksgiving 2019 in Freehold, NJ."
