5.0,"Today is a very, very special day. And I decided that it was finally time to give this Whisky a try. 
    
    Not only did I get one of my holy grail guns yesterday (after a 600 mile drive..12 hours on the road, fun),not only did I have a nice day with some friends on the range and was not confined in my basement the whole day, not only did I crack the first milestone of my weight loss journey today by crashing through the 100lbs barrier (currently 103lbs down, almost 4 months in to the day), no this is also my 100th tasting note (kinda was waiting for the 100lbs thingy with this one...made sense). 
    
    I had the Highland Park 18 on my list since the beginning of my whisky journey. This is the number one whisky that pops up on Distiller, and the hype was real. I'm very, very happy to say that the hype was justified. This might as well be my new favorite Whisky. And at about 120 bucks it's not even that out of reach like some others *cough* looking at you japan *cough*. 
    
    On the nose there are traces of seaweed, a layer of smoke, some sweet honey, the fresh acidity of green apples and a healthy dose of salty coastal air. 
    
    The taste...is just not from this world. Honey sweetness followed by a delicious light peat note, salt and pepper, grilled, honey glazed ribs with a side of bacon, some dark warm fruits to add some complexity, and a somewhat spicy, jalapeno rubbed steak. Medium rare, as god wills it...everything else is heresy, heresy I say! 
    
    I had each of those components in other whiskies, but never together. It works, it's complex, and it is amazing. 
    
    The sweet, smoky aftertaste just lingers, and warms you right up. This is an exceptional whisky, and worth every penny. 
    
    And now if you'll excuse me, I think I need to marry that glass..."

3.25,It's a decent whiskey but really flat and boring. Very light smoke and peat. Sweet and maybe a bit salty (maybe). Fruity and vanilla on nose. I had this on my list (well had a vintage one) on my list for a very long time and got disappointed. It's overpriced and misses more complex taste for 18 years old whiskey. Tried it together with other two and... Springbank 15 is way more interesting. And Ballechin vintage 2008 just blows Highland away.
4.25,Smoky caramel is what I exhale after tasting this baby. Lovely!!
4.0,"I wish I knew if this was the same as the normal 18, just branded differently?

The whiskey is sweeter than I thought it would be with less peat. Easy drinking, smooth, fruits, chocolate, vanilla, and just a hint of smoke."

4.5,"It’s time to visit an old favorite of mine.  One that’s been reimagined with the new Viking theme that HP has embraced:  the 18 year.  Starting in 2017, Highland Park subtitled their world class 18 year old malt with the Viking Pride monicker.  I don’t necessarily see the need to do this with their whisky, but hey- if the sauce is just as good who really cares?  New packaging aside- a heavily sculptured glass bottle will probably add some cost to the price point, though.  Is this the same juice that garners near-perfect scores on countless whisky review websites around the globe?  Lets find out...

The Viking Pride is still a beautiful, rich antique gold in color, it’s still oily and still makes large droplets and sparse, runny legs.  It’s still bottled at 43%, it’s still yada yada yada.  So far so good.

The nose is heavily honeyed, with orchard fruits, vanilla and light smoke.  There’s a fine, salty line running across the nose that I’m not sure I detected before but the worn oak and peppercorn is still there if you give it the appropriate time (I would argue a whisky needs a minimum of 1 minute per year of age to rest and release in your Glencairn).  Give it plenty of swirls, twirls or gentle shakes to expedite the process if you’re in a hurry, I guess.

The palate still brings the sweet peat and lightest BBQ smoke before coating the tongue with a wonderful, bitter dark chocolate wave.  The mouthfeel is luscious although it does feel a bit lighter and more watered down than I recall from the older vintage.  It’s not a deal breaker, and hell, I’ll freely admit it could be me just unconsciously trying to find something to dock points.  So, take that comment with a grain of salt.

The finish is definitely weaker than the older vintage, though.  The smoke and vanilla don’t seem to stick around like it used to.  It’s still a medium length, heavy breather, however.  The lingering sherry sweetness still brings a smile to my face.

Overall, this is still what you know and love from Highland Park.  It’s delicious and satisfying- just like it’s predecessor.  I guess if I gotta find a legitimate gripe- it’s price point.  I had to pay about $20 more for this bottle than I do for the older vintage.  This is also not considering the fact you can still find older bottlings collecting dust at some obscure stores and even online.  So, with that in mind- I think I would recommend seeking those bottles out first, but don’t pass on a good deal if you can only get your hands on the Viking Pride.  It’s still a classic, peated scotch.  Thankfully, that hasn’t changed.  4.5 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

4.5,"Shit on HP is well deserved but this remains a classic and delivers each and every time. Can’t beat this for a balanced, well-aged single malt"
4.5,"There is honey on the nose, with subtle grain/malt notes as well. This scotch is surprisingly sweet, with cherry and a hint of plum, but there is some pure honey sweetness as well. There is much more smoke than I expected, especially from a scotch from this far North. The finish is long, but not super complex. Overall, this is a beautiful scotch, given as a birthday present, by a beautiful friend!!!"

Color added
Chill-filtered

Nose: rich fruits, both bright and dark, including  honey and vanilla; notes of apple, raspberry and pear. A slight smoke and spices, including nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon.

Palate: rich and medium bodied, with notes of cinnamon crisp and apple pie. Dark honey; raisin; a slight sweet smoke; a touch of mint. Some spices, too, lurking beneath the surface, including hints of clove, nutmeg, coriander and vague grassiness; a nice balanced oakiness appears just near the end of the development.

Finish: short medium, with sweetness like peaches and pears; cinnamon sugar, dark chocolate and butter toffee. 

Value: $125-150 USD. Around a standard price for and 18 year these days.

Final thoughts: This is a nicely refined and relaxed sipper offering some complexities and is dangerously drinkable.
But I think there are better 18’s out there at the same price or for a few bucks cheaper, and if Highland Park is your jam, gimme the 12 year old.

Score: 3.5/5

Recommend trying or buying a bottle at a good price."

4.25,"Viking wizards used to combine white chocolate-covered maraschino cherries, a stick of cinnamon, a rose petal, one red grape, ash from one cigar, and mix it in a mortar and pestle of oak and cedar. The concoction was said to make the soul as strong as stone."

4.0,"Served neat in a Glencairn glass from a new, full bottle.  September 2017 batch 17/A211

Dark chocolate truffles and subdued German pastries underly the smoked apple-wood on the nose.

Mouth-feel is a little lighter than I normally prefer, but oh-so-silky.

The smoke is noticable right off the bat, but it unfolds like a Russian ballet.  The smoke and sweet dark chocolate make a comeback, with the chocolate taking on a dark-roast latte characteristic and undertones of BBQ ribs.  Honey, tobacco and very subtle iodine all make appearances.  After a few seconds, there is tart apple and tangy blood-orange.  All the while the smoke is still going.  The finish is akin to a campfire several hours after being out out, with a sweet citrus/milk-chocolate truffle note that gently peters out in a dry, yet salivating, elegant fashion.

This dram is complex, yet immenently approachable.  It is bold, yet sensual.  Compared to the Talisker 18 I just opened, it lacks that last bit of refinement.  Unfortunately, The Naked Grouse replicates 90% of the profile with only the faintest rough edge, and does so for 1/5 of the price."

4.0,"NOSE: very light peat embedded nicely in plums, light cinnamon and cloves, fresh apple, a bid of orange and hard nuts ... really amazing character that welcomes you and impressively shows you a uniqueness Highland Park is able to deliver

PALATE: mild and gentle in the beginning but it intensifies fast, wood aromas but not really oaky, light bitterness, not overwhelming and still very round, some burned brown sugar aroma ... it is very likable but the bitterness and lack of sweetness might be unpleasant for some 

FINISH: mildly bitter, leaves a light burn on the tongue, stays quiet long with mature wooden aroma and very light peat

The smell is definitely the best aspect this whisky has to offer. The 18 years really suits it. Its very light peat gives it some volume but I miss the sweetness in the taste that you are getting from the nose. After smelling it you walk into tasting it with higher expectations which aren’t fully met. But in the end it somehow leaves a different yet still great impression. I think this will be a nice whisky to return to frequently. 

P.S. don’t add water. Completely destroys it."

4.25,"This is a great whisky. I’ve never tasted the 18 pre-Viking branding so I don’t have any comparison to that. However I have had the 12, 14 and a few NAS from HP. This is the best of that bunch but not by that much. I get a more lingering finish than with the 12 and 14 but frankly those do just fine at their price points."
