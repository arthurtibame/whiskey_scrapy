3.5,"Nose: Peat smoke. Bah-boom! straight up, no waiting or discussion - just peat smoke. That slightly sour, fruity, oily smoke that comes from nothing else. But wait .. more appears ... an onshore breeze wafts lots of brine to the nose, along with seaweed and more oiliness, this time citrus oil. Cracking good stuff - aromatic, crisp and clean - even slightly herbal.

Palate: An oily arrival with smoke, which builds and builds into a crescendo of peatiness, citrus flavours, light honey and a little brine. Very like the natural culmination of the nose, in fact. A soft, creamy mouthfeel.

Finish: Medium, with sweet peat smoke rumbling into the darkness. A touch of pepper in the tail

This is a good recommendation for the newcomer on a limited budget who wants to buy a smokey whisky. That's not to say that it's merely a beginner's whisky, but it presents a complete picture of everything you will find in smokey whiskies and does so at an affordable price.

For the more experienced whisky drinker it’s still a very enjoyable dram that is ideal for mixing, and is quite acceptable as a sipper.

There have been some very nice peat-centric malt blends in the last few years (by Compass Box, Douglas Laing, etc.) and this is another welcome addition.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"
4.0,"Nose: Initial hit of peatiness followed by a touch of iodine and limey citrus. Not a huge nose but very nice. Colour: Pale straw – no added colour.
          
          Taste: Almost medium peatiness builds into a sweet citrus that smoothly transitions to a slightly tart lemon citrus finish. Its smooth and the finish while not super long transitions so well and the level of refinement at this price point is just lovely. After the citrus fades you are left with a hint of peat and an echo of smoke. For the price this is a great dram and a real surprise. Its 43% alcohol and best drunk neat, I’d give it 3.5 stars or on my numbering system 91.  It would almost scrape 4 stars when price is factored in except for one flaw that can’t be ignored. The peatiness which is lovely and balanced when you open the bottle does not hang around and fades relatively quickly….by the time you get to the end of the bottle you are left with a citrus bowl and the peat is a memory. Still for $60 in Australia this is top stuff…lets face it in this price bracket you are still in blend (bland) land  based on grains of various quality and caramel colour. The Six Isles has a little touch of class that they simply can’t match and shows that the modern vatted whisky are really showing the way for affordable whisky. Addendum the initial peat on the nose and on the taste does not hang around but the underlying  peat does come through if you give it some time. After drinking some great whiskies and having time to consider - this is 4 stars when you factor in price. If you want a quick quality tour around the six isles this is great place to start."

4.0,"It is not as forward as a Laphroaig, but still rather on the salty side. The other spirits do mellow out some of the palate. The natural color is very appealing!"

4.0,"This is a wonderful vatted malt representing the single malts of the six Scottish isles that have distilleries. This Scotch blend is smooth and clean, with notes of honey and biscuit, a slight floral edge in the middle, and an accent of peat smoke throughout. There is a lingering finish that encourages you to sip another dram. Really quite good. Look for it. Encourage your local store to carry it"

4.0,"Delicious blended malt, and amazing value for the price. Very easy drinking with soft sweetness up front, some complexity on the palate and enough peat on the finish to keep me happy. Definitely natural colour."
