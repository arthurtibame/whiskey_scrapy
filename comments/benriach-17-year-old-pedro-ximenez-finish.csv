3.75,"Not a bad drop. Sherry, date, pepper, oak, fruit cake all come together. 3.75 I'd rate this. It has an underlying bitter note and as per most Benriach's I have a feeling that it won't hold up well to oxidization. It really comes into its own when value for money comes into the equation. $80USD for a 17 year old these days is very reasonable but I still won't buy a bottle."
