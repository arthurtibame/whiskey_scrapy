5.0,Being relatively new to the world of whiskey has probably allowed me to really enjoy this single malt. I'm not persuaded by where it's from or which distillery is producing it. I dont care how long they have been in business or that it's from Waco; a place better known for a crazy cult and a college football team that refuses to play defense. What I can say is that it's exceptionally balanced and bodied. There is a bit of sweetness but that gently fades upon the finish. A really great 'Murican Whiskey. Give it a shot.

Moving past the smoke I get a pear lingering with a good mouth feel.  Not overly oily, but it does coat the mouth well. Finish is good slightly hot.  A few drops of water can mellow out the heat."

5.0,"Give this 10 to 15 minutes in the glass to open up. Try it without water first and then slowly add some, bit by bit until you hit your sweet spot.  This was powerful with alcohol due to the high proof but the flavor was powerful and just amazing.  Rich, with deep fruits like a sherried scotch.  Delicious light smokey flavors, maybe from the barrel char?  Sweet vanilla hits and some caramel like a very rich creme brulee or flan.  This has become one of my favorite whiskies.  Who knows where the taste will go now that they've removed the original creator/distiller but up to this point the whisky is fantastic.  Well worth the try if you can find a bottle."

Mind you, it's not impossible some of the sherry casks that were obviously used to age this whiskey played a large role in the color, since it clearly did so in the taste. There are elements of dates, old wood and nutmeg here, with the finish exhibiting notes of tobacco and pepper. The finish is quite nice and long, but I have to admit I have a difficult time enjoying this spirit."

2.0,"I'm off to Texas in a couple of weeks for a road trip of Southern USA so got hold of a few Balcones samples to see if I should stock up on a few bottles whilst I'm there. Short answer...no...definate no. I'm with cask strength joe on this one. It looks seriously odd. Its quite a weird hazy orange in the glass sample bottle. I had it's sibling the Single Malt Rum Finish earlier in the week (come on Distiller please add the dozen or so whiskies I sent you to your site..it's been ages!) which came across quite artificial and the kitchen sink took a portion of my dram. Given that experience I started off with a smaller measure this time round. Its young, alcoholic and not much else to be honest. Bit of the standard drying wood, anise... Few drops of water didn't help. I'd give it a 2.5 and as its not quite at the 'nothing special but I'm happy to have a few drams' i.e a 3 level then it must be a 2 especially when the round $100 USD a bottle price is factored in."

Nose - fruity, cinnamon, toasted oak, and just a very nice funk I get on Amrut and Balcones, I have to assume it's perhaps a result of the speed aging.  

Taste - There's this berry and oak and cinnamon, and just perhaps just texas malt.  It's really different.  

I'm giving this is a solid 3.0.  I honestly don't really like where this one went, but it's such a clear high quality malt and so well made I can't score it any lower."

4.25,"I love a good single malt and I love a good bourbon. What excites me about this whisky is the combination that makes Balcone's special and my favorite craft distillery. The nose hit me like fall. Woody, leathery, but sweet and tinged with crushed leaves. A fresh trip to Colombia forced the fruity and spicy notes into my favorite dessert of Bananos Calados. The flavor is very long and complex. Water opens it up, but the dram is still smooth for the heat at 106 Proof. So happy to see Balcone's offerings more widely available here in Arkansas.

Aroma: Wood, Fig, leather, & bananos calados (banana, cinnamon, orange, vanilla)
Flavor: Charred oak, dried fruits, spiced pear, & sweet cereal malt.
Aftertaste: Burnt sugar, clove, malt, & oak.

Tons of it on the nose and palate. Spice too on the palate. Tastes young but not too bitter. Pretty tasty."
3.5,"There's lots of flavour packed in here, made into an interesting mix of Bourbon and malt styles. It's got the malty texture, cereal sweetness, and bits of brine from the malt, and lots of oak from the more American style. Unique! Some water brought out tons of tabacco and oak bitters for me. Not my favorite malt style, but it's good."

0.5,"I hate to say it, because I’ve really heard a lot about what this distillery is doing for the Texas whiskey scene, but I (after 4 times going back over 6 months) DO NOT like this whiskey.

Nose: dark DARK fruit, barrel mustiness, the slight tinge of rotting leaves that I hate about the newest expressions of Highland Park 12. Just very old and musty tasting which is not what I look for in a malt heavy whiskey. 

Taste: Almost exactly the same as the nose. Raisins dominate with a slight sugariness. The mid pallet and finish I just don’t like. Not going to get into any tasting notes because I can barely stomach it.  Its just not my thing. 

Not faulting you for linking this whiskey. Sometimes people don’t understand why I like Islay peated Scotch so much and I think this whiskey is just the same. It’s a very acquired taste that I don’t think I’ll ever acquire the taste for. This is a just ones opinion, don’t let this sway your opinion by any means. Especially for all the accolades this distillery has won over the past few years."

3.75,"VERYVERYVERY JAMMY. I think that whatever barreling they used in my specific bottle overpowered the Malt, but this dram definitely has its place on the shelf. IF you love sweet, dark fruit infused whiskey, you will love this, but in that way it seems 1 dimensional.  (I am not getting the wood or toast that other tasters are finding, just fruit, fruit, and more fruit.)"

4.25,"This is phenomenal! I get a surprisingly low amount of heat for the proof (53% for the 50mL sampler I got), with a lot of oak up front and a silky mouthfeel. The palate follows up with bitter chocolate and a bit of funk, with a very long finish of the chocolate and oak. I really enjoy this one for the depth of flavor and complexity, and could definitely see myself picking up a full bottle!"

3.5,"More of an American style single malt and because it is made in Texas, the Texas heat plays a big part in the profile. Big burst of alcohol burn and much heavier texture and flavor than you would get from a scotch. Maybe a little longer in the barrels and a slash of water will tame this wild beast."
4.5,"This malt was pretty complex the more I sat with it and added a drop of water to explore.

N - sweet mulled wine flavors, some cinnamon, clove, cherry 

T - a combo of spice and sweet licorice. Carmel and butterscotch with hints of leather and dried apples

F - earthy was the first impression on the finish with some chocolate and spice. With water black paper became more present

I’ve loved trying the different varieties of American single malts and for the longest time I’ve struggled to get my hands on Balcones. Very glad to add this one to the collection! It is the perfect fall time dram. It is a bit more bourbony sweet than some other American malts I’ve tried but has way more complexity than a traditional bourbon would (IMO). Much like Del Bac to the Southwest and Westland to the Northwest, Balcones is exactly what you’d expect from a Texas whisky!"

3.75,"This whiskey reminds me of Foursquare Empery.  The flavor is bold, rich, sweet and the high ABV is noticeable.   A few drops of water opened a more sweet aroma."
4.25,"Very interesting dram. It surpassed all my expectations. This is a single malt from Texas, that means malted barley and no corn at all, which is kinda a big deal because we are talking about a U.S. whisky. Nevertheless, as soon as you nose it, the first aroma notes are typical bourbon notes. 

Bottled at 53%abv, with a beautiful chesnut color. Amazingly thick and slow legs on the glencairn. 

So many things going on the nose
There is definitively some bourbonish/jack daniels profile, i guess to impress U.S. drinkers.

On the nose: Banana, Vanilla escense, Vanilla ice cream, White chocolate, Maple syrup, Sherry sweetness, Prunes.It sure feels like its going to grow into red fruits but it doesn't. Amazingly sweet and appealing.

On the palate is also a good dram, but not as incredible as the nose. Oily, Cake burnt, Spicy: mild pepper. Some Sherry. Oaky. Sour prunes. A little smoke, woody smoke.
Mostly sour and smoky. Sour sherry. 

Finish is medium, a little hot, ashy. Ginger spice stays a little longer. Malty. Cloying sugar.

Overall it feels like they use a virgin american oak barrel but some sherry must have been used also. The only way banana and vanilla are that strong in the aroma is by using a new barrel of american oak. The dried fruits/sherry notes are mostly on the palate. Great dram, totally recommended: my score for it is a solid 88 over 100 but it surely feels like more. Maybe a 4.5 would do it justice."
3.75,"Nose: sweet caramel with an almost praline tone. There is something rich and spicy hiding underneath 
Taste: toasted bread upfront into a well rounded spiciness that gently mellows
Finish: long and oily that comes back around to toast"

3.25,"I was a scotch drinker before becoming a Bourbon drinker. I now prefer Bourbon so this ended up being a disappointment. I does not compare to Scotch. With that said, it’s not terrible. I get dried fruit on the nose and spice on the palate. Decent finish too. It’s kind of in no mans land between Scotch and American Whiskey."

2.5,"The nose has tart ale, but also some baking spice and maple syrup that combines with golden raisins to be a bit sickly and flat. The tartness has a bit of a woody yeasty scent. There is definitely an ale flavor here. It's surprisingly tart in a way that is a bit jarring, but there is also some sweetness from the baking spices and cinnamon, as well as some maple sweetness. The alcohol is harsh and while there are some interesting flavors, the whole thing tastes a bit young. It does have a distinctly malty flavor to it that I appreciate though. There's a decent amount of smoke too, but it kind of stands as its own flavor and exacerbates the harshness (though it is effective at balancing the sweetness). There's something a bit distinctly bourbony going on here somehow and unfortunately that creates a sharply bitter, slightly tart flavor."

3.25,"How to address the elephant in the (bar)room that is Texas whiskey? I hadn't planned on it, but then I ran across this 5 cl miniature at my favorite liquor store. I just saw a big number '1' emblazoned on the label with the words, ""Texas Single Malt"".  Naturally, this peaked my curiosity.  Because as everyone knows, California is number one (.. and done).  I decided to include this stylish, glass usurper with my purchase. On with the particulars.  Nice aroma with cinnamon, dark spice, and cherry.  (I don't take much stock in the nose.  As far as I'm concerned it's perfume and distilled stuff I don't want to read about.) The initial palate is a burst of cinnamon and red licorice.  Follow on sips emphasize a cinnamon red hots note.  The finish is a tad drying, with soft leather and rafter oak.  A half teaspoon of water opens up the aroma with an undertone of toffee or caramel, lying beneath the dominant cinnamon note.  With water on the palate, I detect a borderline sherry influence, but it is held in check by the cinnamon wagon as its base.  Still, no sulphuric nastiness.  (That's more than I can say for many single malt scotches.)  Despite the ABV of 53%, there's surprisingly little prickle.  This will make for a delightful winter whiskey, no doubt.  But the over-the-top cinnamon note drowns out the other whiskey nerdy things I could've liked about it.  In any event, I'm impressed with what Balcones has accomplished under the conditions that is Texas heat. I'd imagine that must take serious skills and/or b---s. This single malt definitely has a time and place for an occasional dram.  However, there's just not enough here for me to warrant a full bottle purchase.  To wrap things up, while there's a 'Woah' aspect in drinking this, there isn't enough 'Giddy Up' to keep at it.

4.25,"Balcones seems like the people that run it thought to themselves “why don’t we make the best whiskey”...and that was it. The stats sheets read like a whiskey connoisseur’s dream distillery. Their whiskey is high proof, they age and finish them in all sort of styles of barrels. They age the whiskey as long as the Texas heat will allow. They use golden promise barley which is the best...apparently.  They are always experimenting and coming out with new bottles.  They focus on the details. This Texas Single Malt version is a must if you like malt whiskey. Let it be the gateway into Balcones distillery. A true example of how Texans do whiskey."
