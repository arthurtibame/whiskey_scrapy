4.0,"Bigger, waxier, beefier (in stature rather than flavour) than the usual 14. ""More Clynelish than Clynelish."" We all preferred even to the '88 we had straight from the cask. And that's saying something."
3.0,I have the un-chillfiltered Collection of this nice Whiskey.  The signatory vintage from 1997 is for everyone who likes a good fruity dram

3.75,"This specific expression is the Distillers Edition which takes the 14yr and finishes it for 1yr in an Oloroso Sherry Seco (dry versus the typical sweet) cask. This bottle was distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2012. Let's dive in... 

Entry is rich and pretty viscous... Raisin, beeswax and a dash of pepper are the initial notes... Sea spray, dark chocolate and a bit of cinnamon on the mid palate... Finish is pretty lengthy with plums and more spice notes... It's a bit tannic and has a slight salty after taste. It's a lovely take on a heavily sherried Highland malt! This expression is harder to find these days but the 14yr is readily available and worth your consideration!"

3.0,"Much preferred to the independent bottle of the 16yo, although I don't care for the peat dancing atop the sherry here. 3.7/5"
