3.5,Toasted honey peanuts in the aroma.  Vanilla honey peanut in the flavor.  A few drops or water brings more vanilla and citrus in the aroma.

1.25,"I wanted it gone after a few drams. The tropical fruit was nice, especially banana, but it was way too sweet. It didn’t help that it was thin and disappeared from the palate as soon as I sipped."

4.0,"Nose - Dried fruit, Honey light vanilla a perfume like alcohol. 
Taste - A smooth sweetness of dried peaches an apricot that has a light smoke of bourbon and that strength at the end of it to go along with it.
Finish - Tart smokey tingle that has my mouth still filled with hints of everything I just tasted and smelled overall long lasting.

P.s. sweeter with a cigar"
