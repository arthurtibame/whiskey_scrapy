4.0,For me this beat out 13 which is supposed to be so good. I did it blind twice... same result. Yeah maybe I’m not most experienced guy but I know which one I would drink more

4.25,"Some heat with hints of caramel, honey and cherry on the palate. Lingering finish that stays with you. Very good if you enjoy barrel proof bourbons. This batch (batch 10) is just a notch below Batch 12 in my opinion."
