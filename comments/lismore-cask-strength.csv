3.5,"To begin, I bought this bottle for $26 + sh (which was split with several bottles). Despite the variety in my purchase, this bottle was the one I was most curious about due to the huge score that it seemed to be. I tasted it immediately but remember not thinking much of it. Not bad but not amazing. I still felt worth more than I had paid. Today I finally made it back to this bottle. Remembering it was quite hot, and possibly showing its youth, I added a couple drops of water to be able to actually taste it on the first sip. I'm a complete novice so I will skip the smell and taste in place of this. I confirmed that this bottle, if found at less than $50, is an amazing deal. Most likely from Glenfarclas and a great bottling of that distillery if that is true. If you want tasting notes, I suggest looking up notes from the GF 12 (maybe) and imagine them AMPLIFIED. Not quite as much of a punch as the GF105 though. Sounds good doesn't it? It is definitely worth a try if you can still find it for that low price."
