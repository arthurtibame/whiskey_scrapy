2.5,"I am reviewing the standard batch product of the Weller Full Proof. I make this distinction because there are store pick single barrels out there that may well be different. For example I think the Antique batch product is just ok but the Store pick I have I think is excellent! 

Like all Weller releases there was a tremendous amount of hype surrounding this Bourbon and finding a bottle in the wild will prove to be extremely difficult (I was told only 9 cases total were allocated to AZ with almost all going to bars and restaurants). So when I spotted this at my favorite staycation resort for a reasonable-ish price per pour I jumped on it! I ended up getting right about 3oz as it was at the end of the bottle! So definitely enough to form a solid opinion. Spoiler alert, it's not great!

On the palette it's very thin and very muted upon entry. This is pretty surprising considering the high proof. You get some vanilla and brown sugar with a slight hint of spice. At the mid palette the brown sugar becomes more of a toffee note leading to a decent finish where all the alcohol finally arrived with a decent hug. A spice note lingers a bit. The more I sipped it the more surprised I was at just how muted and thin it is! It's greatest asset is it's very smooth and easy to drink but that is also it's greatest drawback. 

Now forget the crazy secondary pricing let's examine this for it's SRP at $49.99. Is this on the same level as say Old Ezra or a Knob SiB? No, not even close. Is it as good as Weller 12, 107 or even the CYPB. Nope it's definitely not. Is it better than the sub $20 Weller SR? Yes, that it is!

So what you have here is undoubtedly young mediocre barrels where Buffalo Trace hoped that releasing it at a higher proof would mask it's youth. Unfortunately, the results are not overly positive. 

If you hunt this look for a Store pick as I am sure they got access to better barrels than what made it into the batch product. I personally would not even recommend the batch product at retail based on taste alone.

I am sure this won't be a popular opinion but I can tell you that every one I discussed this with in the Arizona Whiskey Community group concurred with this opinion and if anything they felt I was too generous on how highly I rated the finish! 

So in conclusion is it a bad drop at $49.99? Not really just not a good value and very simple. If you are simply looking for value against secondary pricing, then ofcourse buy it. If you like to drink your Whiskey, seek out a pour! Cheers all!"

4.75,"Ahhh yess. I got this one at my local store that did a Single Barrel store pick. I was lucky enough to get one before they ran out in two hours.
The color is nice and on the darker side.
The nose has vanilla, baking spices, some leather and light fruitiness.
The palate is nice and has some baking spices, but has more of the light fruit coming through along with a nice leather note and some oak. It has a nice thicker mouthfeel as well.
The palate is also nice and long. Not too hot going down either, but still bold.

I really enjoyed this one. I did a comparison to the Weller Special Reserve as well. The SR was very muted by comparison and not anywhere close as far as depth and flavor goes, as you would expect."

3.0,I wasnt impressed. it's on par with the cypb which is barely better than the SR. What I wanted and what this is are 2 different things. I wanted it to be close to the flavor of the 12 year(2nd best in the line up) but full proof. it doesnt have to be 12 year split the difference with the Antique( best in the line up) make it 9 or 10 years old. I dont know it with certainty but it might be younger than the SR

4.5,The Weller you've been waiting for.  Since I'll never sniff the BTAC WLW this is a nice higher proof add to the line up above the Antique.  Very nice sipper.
3.0,"This bourbon is not worth the hype. I was lucky enough to get one at retail and for under $100 it may be worth it to some. However, do not pay secondary for this. It shares the same profile as OWA with having just a few more proof points. The biggest issue I have with this that differs from the distiller review is the finish is very short and very thin. The initial flavor is actually really really good but quickly fades into nothing. The hype that has driven Weller to be impossible to find and the prices to be bloated beyond belief make this one an easy pass and one that you’re not missing out on if you’ve ever had Antique 107."

4.75,"Spoiler alert - Weller fanboy here.  I just like the Buffalo Trace “funk” about it.  It’s like the aroma of wet fall leaves - not for everyone but emotionally does something for me I suppose.

Got together with a friend and drank the lineup with the exception of the unicorn CYOB.  Started with special reserve - funk + week old banana, corn sweetness and a hint of oak.  Delicious but thin and virtually no finish.

Next up, pseudo-unicorn Weller 12.  Overrated some would say.  For $300 you bet your ass.  For MSRP still solid.  Basically special reserve with a little oak on the nose and more barrel char and a bit of wood spice on the palate.  Still thin and a disappointingly short finish.

Call me crazy but Antique 107 has been my favorite (is it still???).  The nose is profound compared to SR and 12.  Tons of vanilla, oak, caramel.  The palate rings true and while hot is not sharp.  The finish lingers with brown sugar and wood spice.  Damn satisfying for the proof.  It doesn’t have the mouthfeels of a 125+ proof non-chill filter but...

That’s where full proof comes in.  This, in my opinion, is it.  First the color - unlike the other theee with their amber hue I force myself to wonder if a slight greenish hue is present?  Could it be the non-chill filtering (or just being three deep)?  The nose is akin to the 107.  Warm, rich caramel, oak and faint wood spice.  The mouthfeel and smoothness though, that’s where it gets uncanny.  This drinks like maple syrup with a dash of cayanne - no up front burn but a slow warmth.  All the classic flavors of the Antique are there with the funk still coming up front, fading mid palate and turning deep caramel sweetness with wood spice on the finish.

This particular lineup, for me, places Full Proof well at the top.  I’d probably give Antique a close second and sadly the 12 falls to third place.  If I had a fireplace and a cigar then maybe the 12 would win with its slightly more predominant age/char.

How much would I pay for this guy as a non store pick?  I’d drop $100 without hesitation.  That’s saying a lot given the excellent finds in the $50-60 range (OF 1920, Four Roses Small Batch Select, Bookers if you’re lucky).  

So, that’s that.  If you love the funk then happy hunting.  I’d fill a bunker with it if I could find a truck to hijack."

Mmm. Good stuff. How could you really go wrong when taking an already wonderful weller product and proofing it up, though? Nice and bold from nose to finish. Tons of spice, heavy oak, and tasty cherries. I like the peanuts on the nose but it unfortunately doesn’t translate over to the palate. Solid flavors of vanilla and traditional caramel as well on the palate. Finish could be a bit longer."

4.5,"Read a few reviews with wildly different responses to this bottle. To me, this a toned down WLW (not nearly as polished a finish nor as much complexity on the palate) combined with a W12. Great nose. The sweet wheat is apparent up front (vanilla) with strong cherry cola and heat on the backside. I have a store pick (Buster’s Liquors) but I would rate this very highly and say it’s a perfect compliment to the Weller line. Maybe the standard offering was subpar but at least some of the store picks were true gems."
4.0,"BACKGROUND: Originally released in June of 2019, Weller Full Proof has quickly become one of the most-sought and hardest-to-find bourbons to enter the market in recent years.

According to the Buffalo Trace Distillery, which produces the Weller line, Full Proof will be made in extremely limited quantities and released on an annual rather than continual basis.

It joins the other Weller expressions, which currently include the Create Your Perfect Bourbon (C.Y.P.B.), Old Weller Antique 107, Weller 12-Year, and Weller Special Reserve.

The back label of the bottle provides the history of the brand and the details of the distillate, and it reads:

“William Larue Weller developed his original bourbon recipe with wheat, rather than rye. Bottled at the same 114 proof in which it was entered into the barrel, this non-chill filtered wheated bourbon forgoes chill filtration to preserve all the naturally occurring residual oils and flavors that occur during the distillation and aging process (potentially making it appear cloudy at cold temperatures). This bourbon balances a rich mouthfeel, with robust notes of vanilla and oak. A whiskey that satisfies the demand of the non-chill filtered whiskey enthusiasts, honoring the man who made wheated bourbon legendary.”

The bottle I sampled is a “Single Barrel Select” pick by the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Agency, and I acquired it through the ABC’s November lottery for highly allocated bottles.

It retails for $49.99

NOSE: The nose immediately brings the smell of a freshly-baked pound cake with vanilla frosting to mind, likely because it is wheat-based rather than rye.  A pleasant cherry scent and some oak round out the nose.  The nose smells like a desert you would want to eat with a spoon and then ask for seconds.

PALATE: The taste of heavily buttered bread presents first on the palate, and it is followed by a bit of citrus flavor.  While most bourbons offer warmth on the back of the palate, this one is very front-forward in showing off its proof.  Perhaps the best part of the entire experience is the bourbon’s syrup-like texture, which coats the mouth, jawline, and throat and hangs around for a nice visit.

FINISH: Oak makes its presence known on the finish along with leather and cinnamon red hots.  It is an unusually long finish that begs for a chronograph to time its length.  While the flavors on the palate were bight and lively, the finish is delightfully aged and mature, as if the bourbon developed in character from the front of the palate to the back of the throat.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: The Full Proof is a great addition to the Weller line, and, in my opinion, offers an experience that is unique from all of the brand’s other expressions.

Of the Weller bottles in my collection - I do not have C.Y.P.B. - I would rank them in descending order as: Weller Full Proof > Old Weller Antique 107 > Weller 12-Year > Weller Special Reserve.

Because Full Proof has proven so enjoyable, I am even more excited about the development of Weller Single Barrel, the label of which was recently placed on file with the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)."

3.25,"Dep's Pick Number 2.

OK - so store pick, I've had 2 other store pick samples and while they are different, I think there's a profile emerging and more importantly I think we need a collection of tasting notes found in these single barrels as over time I expect they'll get pretty consistent range of common tasting notes. This isn't say knob creek where you have much older whisky and more variability as a result.

Nose - fruity, bubble gum (classic bubble ym), drop of oak, and some cinnamon. A decent but not offensive alcohol kick at the end as well. Honestly you could give me this next to a 107 and I'd have no clue which one it was, just be a question of batch/barrel.

Taste - Ok the palate we have a really well made and really nicely complex bourbon. You get the classic wheat bready yeasty profile in all wellers. Fruity, bubble gum, but then as it moves to the finish I get dark chocolate, almost a smores with dark chocolate and instead of gram crackers it's that weller wheat. But you totally get toasted marsh mellows and bitter dark chocolate. There's a nice bit of oak here, enough where if someone told me that this was getting into the 12 year range, I'd buy it. The oak is very well integrated into the flavor and enhances the sweetness, but never comes close to distracting. It is perhaps a touch drying on the finish. 

Overall - really sweet, really rich, really dessert like, and sadly....while no buffalo trace product is worth secondary let alone the hype, this is an outstanding sub 50 dollar bourbon (all be it just BARELY sub 50). 

3.25 a score I just gave to a 200 dollar bourbon that I've debated buying a second of. And frankly this might be better. What would it need to move up? Well, it's complex for a weller and certainly for the price, but for a 4 star bourbon it's not there. i could see myself moving this to a 3.5 but any higher doesn't work. I also for science added water (and then more) and it doesn't hurt much, but it somewhat brings to surface what I'll call a lack of refinement that you'd get in the upper upper echelon bourbons. But fear not if you do add water, it'll be fine."

Leather.  It is very inviting.  Reminds me of 2019 Birthday Bourbon in many ways.  NOT what I was expecting compared to Antique.

Nice creamy texture and it lights the tongue up with cool flavors.  Wow.  Taste is better than the nose.  Long long legs.  On the tongue, the baked apples, cinnamon sugar, and hint of cherry light up the tongue even before the swallow.  Transitions to deep, rich vanilla, pastry crust.  Waves of vanilla returns and some oak emerges as well.  

It’s great, but it’s not over the top great.  In some ways this barrel is more simplistic and straight forward than Antique, which is odd to me. The extra proof didn’t result in more flavor or spiciness, it just gave it a creamy texture and legs for miles.  Antique can throw people off blind because it’s such a spicy beast.  This is a more traditional wheater.  Top of mind, I think the Boone County MGP 6 year wheaters beat this."
