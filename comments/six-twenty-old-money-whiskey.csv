5.0,"I love reading other people's tasting notes of stuff I like.  It really gives perspective on what i'm tasting.  Especially when I'm not gettign what they are.  Love this whiskey.  It's my daily drinker, so to speak.  First, it's a  long, long, long - tasting whiskey.  Second, it's very easy, kind of low-intensity.  Full wheat whiskey 'easiness.'  Awesome balance in palate (beginning and end).  Whenever I pour one for myself and sit in front of the TV, the wife invariably drinks half my pour.  Too funny."
