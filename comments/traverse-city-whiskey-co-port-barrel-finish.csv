3.75,"I have found finished whiskey to be a bit hit and miss. Some are great like Angel's Envy and others have taken a bit flat. TC Whiskey is a local place so I am hoping it is a winner. 

Nose is mildly sweet. Defintely get some fruitiness in there with some classic whiskey backbone, but the ethanol is a little high on the sniff.

On the tongue the first sip is relatively mild. The port finish is quite noticeable and plays the leading role. A few subtle brown sugar notes come through followed by a more classic cinnamon burn finish. The burn is pretty mellow though and fades quickly. Overall I don't love it it or hate it. It's a nice pour that departs from the traditional dram and goes down smoothly. The barrel proof version is double the price, but I am intrigued to give it a try....."

3.0,"Nose: light wine, light vanilla, light orange
Body: medium
Palate: port wine, mandarin orange, light vanilla
Finish: late vanilla medium to short
Note: like Nate said more smooth than cherry. I don’t like this as much as the cherry. It’s ok."
3.75,"Another TCW tipple and this time it's their straight bourbon whiskey finished in port wine casks. The alcohol aroma is obvious just after the pour, so I let it breathe for a few minutes before going in for my first honest to goodness smell. The nose is unsurprisingly strong with the smell of port and is underpinned by corn, raisins, caramel, and dried fruit. The flavors from the nose carry over onto the palate and are aided by a mild and pleasant spice in the swallow. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side and dry with a finish that is quite short, but just enough to leave you wanting more. For the folks at Traverse City, smooth is the name of the game. While the flavors and feelings are undeniably bourbon, the experience is pure Michigan."
