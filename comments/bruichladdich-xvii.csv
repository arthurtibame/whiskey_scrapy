3.5,"Some rubbing alcohol astringency at first whiff but with a bit of time, it settles down to a softer citrusy note. Adequately full mouthfeel, with hints of oak behind the malt."
4.75,"Bruichladdich 17, Islay, 98 pts. Sweet toffee, treacle and nuts, a little pear and dried apricot. More body and flavour than the 17, with less assertive alcohol. I prefer more smoke and a little more depth, but this is a really good drinker."
