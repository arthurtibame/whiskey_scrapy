4.5,"Maybe I don't knows my whiskies... How do I enjoy this more than the average here?

Not peat, but a touch smokey. Almost ashtray. Caramel. Palate plays quite nice - definitely some sherry there.  It's sweet on the tongue. 

REALLY GOOD, like almost all Amruts."
4.25,"Not to bad. Tried at Dramfest 18 and I'd give it a 3.25. My palate was getting a bit stuffed though so might be higher on a good day. Spectrum was definately better

Ok update 2 years later Dramfest 2020. Woah now this was awesome, not sure why I gave it such a low score prior but on both festivals I tried it at the end of day two many many drams in so highly likely I mixed up my notes. This was really good dram. Not in the league of Chairman's reserve but 4.25 to 4.5 territory easy.."

5.0,"After sampling intermediate sherry and Kadhambam, I took this in a tough decision. This is full of flavors from floral notes, raisins, chocolate, caramel, mangoes, passion fruit, and some smoke."
