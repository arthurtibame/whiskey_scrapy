4.0,An all time fave. Loads of flavour from I’m assuming 1st fill bourbon casks.
5.0,"A superb whisky! A vanilla cake nose with some honey notes. Spicy taste at first, but the vanilla, honey and cocoa creates a tasty experience. The finish with dark red whine tanins, and also some honey, cocoa."

3.25,Very light in color. Aroma is very floral. Taste is also floral with a touch of honey. Finish turns slightly bitter and oaky. A touch of water helps warm it up a bit. Very pleasant.
