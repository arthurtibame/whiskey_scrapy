4.0,$10 pour @Barfly in Baltimore. Good and smooth on the tongue and equally smooth on the finish. Just a touch of chocolate sweetness on the finish

1.0,"Disappointed. The nose has a fantastic chocolate sweetness with vanilla and honey. However the taste is harsh. Was expecting something rich and sweet, but it’s dry, astringent, herby, and peppery."

4.0,I really like this “flavored” whiskey. The infused dark chocolate is very subtle and doesn’t add any sweetness over what you would already find in your typical bourbon.
