4.5,"I did not want this bottle. If there is anything more immediate than instant buyers remorse, I had it. But I also had no choice. When you have a local liquor store that is really good to you, and the guy that always geeks out with you on bourbon says, “Hey, I think you’d really like this one.” It’s not actually an option; you’re buying that whiskey. And in this case, I’m really glad I did.

Nose has a bit of brine, but there’s a sweetness there too. Honey and powdered sugar.

Body is interesting. I was expecting a bit of that pickle juice from the briny smell, but it’s not there. I get honey, lemon, and orange peel. The weird part is, my mouth is tingling like I’m drinking a rye, but the flavors are bourbon flavors. I actually really dig that combo.

Finish is more of the orange, and a little bit of brine, but it doesn’t detract from the citrus.

This is one of the biggest surprises I’ve had in some time. “A blend of straight whiskeys.” “Utah.” All the words that should make me afraid, but this little guy delivers. I’m not sure what their exact blend is, but I’d love to see someone attempt this mash bill without blending. For science. Based on the fact that blending any bourbon with a 95% rye mash bill makes it unlikely that the end result has 51% corn or rye... because... math... if someone were to do this in the barrel, they’d get something entirely new. After enjoying this one so much, from this point forward, I’d be happy to call such concoctions:  “Straight Bourye.”"
4.5,Very unique. Loads of honey and liquorice on the finish. Super smooth and best of both rye and bourbon worlds!
3.75,"Like getting snapped out of the tunnel in spacetime because your machine blew a fuse.

While it is enjoyable, the rye influence is very forward on this one. But, it fades moderately fast to a mellow taste. Not too shab if I do so say."

4.25,"Admittedly, one of my favorites- golden in color. Nose smells of sherry and apple. Black tea, nutmeg, cinnamon, tobacco leaves and toffee on the tongue. Finish is long and pleasant with the spice of the rye dominating"

4.25,"N:  Spearmint, Citrus, Cherry and Brown Sugar
P:  Mint, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Butter and Vanilla.
F:  Cinnamon, Brown Sugar and Spearmint Gum.  

Really enjoyed this.  Only complaint is that I would like a little higher proof to kick up the finish.  Well done!"

3.75,"This is a quality rye that you can sip solo, but I am undecided on whether or not it will make my final rotation. Most likely not as there are others I prefer at this price point. Too much brine on the palate for me. The old ""your mileage may vary"" is appropriate here.
N - Butter, vanilla, licorice 
P - Nutty, brine, rye spice
F - mid length, spice, caramel"
4.5,"Nose is full of sweet vanilla. Palate is warm and spicy, but finishes long with that same sweet vanilla."

5.0,A new favorite!  Sweet and smooth.... Way too easy to drink.... Fortunately the dollars will keep me from over-indulging!  As a Hoosier whiskey maker myself I’m proud his came from home!  Taste as described in expert review!
4.25,Rye spice with some sweetness. Pepper. Buttery.
4.0,"Orange zest, clove, cinnamon, and vanilla on the nose. It’s spice heavy up front that fades to a sweetness with hints of leather. It’s has a medium finish that has more spice and bitterness. A well balanced pour."

3.75,"2019 edition is better to me than prior editions. I definitely get the spice and spearmint that people report, but that’s profile is not my favorite.
Better options for $79."
4.0,"Brings more spice than expected, an ice cube helps."
