3.5,"The nose is mild and creamy with banana custard, maple, vanilla and cinnamon. The palate has more cinnamon coming through along with oak, vanilla, creme brûlée and cooked sugar. The finish is medium and fades quickly with banana custard and oak fading nicely."

3.75,"nose is wonderfully dark fruit and vanilla with caramel, sweet and pungent with a mild spice that gives way to the palate. tasting is very similar with the distinct jack daniels hard candy and barrel wood forward  spice, vanilla again followed by a dry, oily, dark earth background. finish is sweeter and the Tennessee filtering finds its notes here with some smokey tones as well. finish isnt long but some more percieved oils do draw it out vs old no. 7"
