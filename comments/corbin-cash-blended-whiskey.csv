3.0,"On the nose, you find banana, walnuts, baking spices and a hint of vanilla after a drop or two. It's not long after that first impression however that you realize this is the best part of what Corbin Cash Blended offers.

This one, for me at least, was lost on the tongue. While it's nothing awful, the heat of this whiskey sizzles in the mouth and hurts your chances of finding the character you saw on the way in. It's sad really because the nose is genuinely enjoyable, but the mouth on this feels flat and boring. Similar to the Assassins Creed movie, this begins with a lot of potential and never finds its footing. 

You're better off looking elsewhere if you want and nice blend. This one simply didn't bring all the elements together, especially for the price (FWF share #34)
