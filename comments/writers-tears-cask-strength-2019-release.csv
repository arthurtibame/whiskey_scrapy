4.25,"A little bit of woody flavor like I’d expect from a scotch, with a heat that matches the proof. Under all that is a really good, complex flavor that’s there if you look for it."

Glass: Glencairn (for Irish whiskey, sorry)

Colour: full golden amber shine
Nose: sweet banana and toffee. Brown syrup.
Palate: first impression is the inevitable sharpness from the 53 %, but not overpowered by the alcohol. Very spicy and metallic initially, but adding just a few drops of water opens the dram to greater heights bringing complexity and oak into the mix. Mouthfeel is not very oily or greasy, but some buttery notes on the tongue are clearly present.
Finish: mineral and buttery mouthfeel continues longer than taste
4/5"
