4.0,"A pleasant in-house blend from Loch Lomond. The nose is classic Loch Lomond - a little fruity, a little funky, a little butterscotch. The palate here, though, switches it up - while there are some of the sweet, butterscotch, vanilla, toffee, etc. notes that I expect from there, there is also a BIG savory, herbal quality to this one, too. It's a nice, rather different interpretation of the Loch Lomond personality!"
3.25,"The cheapest blend in the loch lomond range is actually a very drinkable whisky, with easy tasting notes without a hard alcohol note.

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished gold color

On the nose, honey, vanilla crest, apples. 
On the palate, honey, cinnamon, ashes. 
Aftertaste is medium long, a little herbal. 

Not much to say here, for the price, it is a good offer, not for critics but for drinkers. 65/100."
3.0,Tasty for a cheap blend - very drinkable
2.5,"For some time now I've sung the praises of Loch Lomond Reserve Blended Scotch as one of the bargains of scotch whisky. It's rich, malty, with a smoky and vegetal note but most importantly an individuality that is rare for a budget level blend. At least, that was the situation until a month or so ago.

At that time my compatriot @KT66 alerted me to a diminution in the profile of Loch Lomond Reserve, a condition with which, after tasting a couple of recent batches, I have to concur. TL:DR - This blend has lost something.

Whatever the reason (and I suspect that it is that the initial bottlings are now being replaced with later batch product), this blend has lost a bit of moxie. The smoke note is still there, subtle and sooty, but less prominent. The fruit is diminished and the sugars are a little more banal. The ethanol note is more present. It is still a good scotch blend but it tastes as though the recipe has changed and they now have a higher proportion of grain whisky to malt.

At the price, still good value and recommended, but don't expect to be blown away as you once might have been.

3.5,"A rather average blend, with a moderate touch of peat. A bargain at a fair price. Notes of honey flavor, biscuit, malt, pear?--perhaps. I was curious about this, so spent about $33 for 1.75 to have it shipped in from the west coast. It is pleasant enough at that price point to use as a ""jug"" scotch for parties, etc. However, for daily availaibility I will probably stay with Grant's Family Reserve, which I don't have to ship in."
3.0,"Re-review at bottle-kill

Nose: Warming and cosy with leather, honey, malt, orange, peach, peanut and vanilla notes. There is also a smoke presence with ash and chimney soot qualities (it's not like Islay smoke, but very agreeable). There are hints of butterscotch and an absence of any intrusive ethanol scent. The dry-glass aroma is malty vanilla.

Palate: The arrival is soft and sweet and mainly focused on malty flavours. As it rests in the mouth some warm cinnamon spice emerges along with a little tannic black tea. The development (yes, a blended scotch with development!) brings porridge and nutty flavours, bitter orange marmalade, a hint of the same sooty smoke from the nose and a smidgeon of licorice. The texture is deliciously creamy and oily - this is an unusually rich mouthfeel for a blend.

Finish: Short. Some sweet tones but the tea flavour from the palate lingers and turns a little bitter, which is the single fault of any consequence. There is a puff of smoke in the aftertaste.

This bottom-shelf priced whisky punches well above its weight and is one of the great bargains in scotch whisky. It's not up there with the more expensive top shelf blends, however in its price range it is outstanding value. Since discovering it about 18 months ago it has become my mixing scotch of choice.

The Loch Lomond distillery has two pot stills, six hybrid pot/column stills, a Coffey still and several continuous column stills on site. Total output is 23 million litres annually, which makes it one of the biggest distilleries in Scotland. By combining the output of their different stills in a variety of ways they can bring to market a range of single malts and blended whiskies. 

Other blended scotch whiskies are ""brands"" created by mixing malts from many distilleries with a large proportion of grain whisky, the goal being to engineer a specific profile and ensure brand consistency. In contrast because Loch Lomond Reserve is a blend of only Loch Lomond malt and grain, its profile, like that of a single malt, is a representation of a single distillery character. I believe this makes it the only example of ""single blended scotch"".

""Good"" : 3 stars"

2.25,"The nose is pretty terrible. Ever piss on a campfire? Smells like that, firewood and ammonia.

Taste is tolerable. Unidimensional burnt oak, with a little bit of peat smoke. 

There’s a reason why scotch is normally a lot more expensive than $26."

2.5,"Colour is pale orange-brown.
The nose is quite satisfying - not very spiritous with a hint of smoke, fruity sweetness with bold grain and wood tones; even some steak meat notes show up sometimes along with smoke-dried salami however the overall aroma might not be called very bright - it’s just neutral.
The taste is more prominent. It obtains notes of grass, bread, vanilla, spices and citruses which are the most defining here. Also some flower dust. Some peat and smoked salami. Though, again, the taste is a bit spiritous and bitter.
Finish is more about burnt oak and bread with some light sweet notes.
LL Reserve is not that simple, though all the terms are not well expressed but decent in general.
Well, I rate it fairly high above average relatively to the cheapest blends (such as Tullamore D.E.W or Ballantines). And I even might choose it over some of the single malts as well."

3.0,"Nose: Fragrant and dusky-warm, fruity and floral (dried orange peel, peach, apple and vanilla), butterscotch toffee, malt extract, a mild and warm smokiness. The dry glass aroma is vibrantly vanilla.

Palate: Soft arrival with a rounded and comfortable texture. Malty, cereal (like oatmeal porridge), crème brûlée, hazelnuts, almonds, peanuts, sweet orange preserve, stewed apples with cloves and cinnamon, and some very light smoke.

Finish: Short/medium. Honey, malt and vanilla.

This is a bottom-shelf priced whisky that is way better than it has any right to be. The nose is richly fragrant (oddly reminiscent of Bruichladdich, although a bit heavy-handed) with prominent floral and fruity tones.  A warm and inviting nose without any banal ethanol presence (it’s there, but not intrusive).

The palate follows the pattern and is balanced, hearty and relaxing. This is the whisky equivalent of that old crochet throw-rug you inherited from great aunt Agatha – maybe nothing inherently valuable, but hard to beat for familiar, cosy warmth.  There is a strong vanilla oak tone right throughout that makes me think there were at least a few fresh casks involved somewhere along the line.

At the price this is an amazing bargain and highly recommended. I'd go so far as to say it is currently (2018) the bargain blend to beat all others. Honestly, if you're still drinking one of the other ""regular suspect"" old-guard blends then give this a try next time you need a mixer - you will not regret it.

“Above Average” : 3 stars"

1.0,This bottle is awful.  Thought I’d give this one a try since I really enjoyed the Loch Lomond single grain.....nope. Overly peaty with an absolutely nasty unrefined tequila like finish.
3.0,"Ok in Australia this is $40 and in that club this is an interesting dram. Nose has butterscotch, butternut biscuits, peat and a touch of ethanol weaved together. Not amazing but certainly enough going on to tell you this is not just another mass produced blend. Sweet toffee/butterscotch and vanilla moving to light tannin and like High Commissioner a touch of charcoal and spice, nicely balanced and very smooth for a blend. Cereal malt mixed with a herbal finish. It is lightly peated like the nose but again nice and refined dram at this price point. 3 stars or 88 points - top result for NAS blend."
