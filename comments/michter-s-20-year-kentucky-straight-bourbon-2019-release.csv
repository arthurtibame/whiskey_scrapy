4.25,"Exceptional nose -  cherries and light spice, very inviting. 

Palate is medicinal with notes of cherry and dark chocolate. Light and spicy. 

Smooth finish, very well done."
5.0,"One hell of a bourbon with notes of caramel, vanilla, chocolate, cherry, corn, oak, pepper, cinnamon, mint, cloves, maple syrup, and pecan pie."
