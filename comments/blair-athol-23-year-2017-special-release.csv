3.75,"This is a walnutty whisky. Not everyone likes walnuts and it’s not a style of dram I’d want every day. But that earthy flavor makes for an interesting change, especially when it’s coated in oily goodness and sandwiched between a honeyed nose and a silky finish. In a different league to the rather pedestrian 12 year Flora & Fauna."
