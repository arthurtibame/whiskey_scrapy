5.0,"Even with the hype around the Van Winkle name, this rye stands alone. Though the label says 13 years, it is far likelier that most batches prior to 2016 were closer to 19 years. Sadly, the legendary tanked blend of Cream of Kentucky and Old Medley that was supplying these bottles for years ran dry in 2016. 2018 will introduce an all-Buffalo Trace rye, so its anyone’s guess if they can keep the magic going."

5.0,"@ home, just a textbook American Rye. Big nose, I'm getting sweet spices, molasses, wood (both tannins and fresh cut,) cherry and citrus pith finishing with an herbal bitterness that reminds me a bit of quinine.  All the flavors I'd expect on the palate are there too: pepper and baking spices, orange oil, rich rye grain in the mid palate.  Fantastic."

5.0,This was my first USA whiskey with gravitas and it was good!  Dark cherry is where u need to base yourself and work out your taste from there. Despite its strength water didn't add to much to its development but have good memories of this

The feel follows suit with a nice subtlety silky feel. Just enough bite and spice to remind you that it's a Rye. The best Rye I've had so far."

  At 13 years it's quite smoky like other good Van Winkle Whiskies.   I enjoy it very much and will buy another bottle when I see it."

Really really really nice.  Gentle cinnamon nose.  Spearmint and cinnamon candy, approachable spice.

Loving this stuff.  5-10 more proof would be perfect but no complaints.  Some lingering anise."

4.75,"the bite of a rye, but in a completely different way. this eye you can truly taste the complexity of the grain. deep oak from the 13 year age."

2.0,"Overall: Forgettable, exactly what a whiskey shouldn't be.
On the nose : Honey, Rackhouse, Overall sweet smelling.
On the palate : Slight rye spice. Really tiny bit of oak. Little  bit of those characteristic menthol qualities you find in some ryes. Very light viscosity, very thin. Really ""smooth"". Aftertaste is lackluster.

Would rather have Sazerac 6 year."

5.0,This was the most amazing Rye I have ever had . It was full of flavor and ever so smooth. This is a sipping rye meant to be savored. It’s so smooth you could easily drink yourself into a buzz before you put the brakes on.

5.0,Flat out amazing. Very complex with the sweeter notes of rye coming through. I was expecting a much spicer profile but was surprised when it wasn’t spicey at all. Very enjoyable but by no means is it worth the secondary prices.
2.5,2018 release. Did not live upto the predecessor (2016).  Thinner and less of the punch you in the face rye spice. Add a few drops of water and a strong mint note came through on the nose.  Biggest disappointment of the evening.  Would not pay anymore than msrp for this bottle.

4.25,"Very nutty interesting, unique taste on the palate. 
I really enjoyed the nose. 
For a 13 year rye as it should be soft & well rounded 
BUT still prefer a $55 bottle of Willett 4 Year rye which is 1/2 point higher in my opinion, or a Handy .25 to .5 higher rating for me depending on year, which at retail is/ was $114...but the VWFR Rye was DEFINITELY a treat. 
Myself & 7 friends split the bottle which was  AN EXPENSIVE TREAT, and if not at retail DOUBT I WILL REPEAT.  
The highlight was sharing it with friends more so than the actual characteristics of this rye.  
Getting tired of the game the Van Winkles play    selling to stores knowing the bottle will be marked up 10 times & then they play god by attempting to shutting down the secondary market which to be honest could be solved if they limited the price via contract that their products must be lets say no more than double retail OR that store will not receive their allocation the following time PERIOD problem solved!!! 
What these ego maniacs do not realize in their myopic view is not all bourbons are distributed in all states as well as some people such as myself have had bottles for many years & some bottles no longer fit ones flavor profile as well as others so ideal to be able to trade without the Van Winkles stepping on so many peoples toes, in fact to show my disgust I will never buy another bottle of Van Winkle = NOT HARD FOR ME TO DO."
5.0,"Nose: just looking at it was amazing. It had a beautiful darker color to it. It looked and even smelled like honey. It didn’t smell as spicy as I would have imagined for rye whiskey. I could smell dark fruits with a little bit of vanilla with the oak. 

Taste: I mean my gosh. So smooth, especially for rye whiskey. I got some spice at first, but it was more baking spices, like cinnamon. But that quickly turned into a sweet, but dark cherry flavor, along with some other darker fruits, like plums. 

This was absolutely mind blowing. Again, well done van winkle, you never fail to amaze me."

5.0,"The nose is a great balance of honey, clove, rye, oak, vanilla and baking spices. The palate is dry and full of rich rye spiciness balanced by vanilla, cinnamon, baking spices, oak and a hint of maple. The finish is long with fading rye, maple, vanilla and oak, with lingering cinnamon spiciness."

5.0,"Yep, i just had this unicorn. 

I believe it is one of the hardest Rye Whiskies to find, and it is the hardest Van Winkle to come across. 

And you know what? It is delicious. 

I am not a fan of rye whiskies but this one blew my mind. Hands down this is the best Van Winkle i have had (and i have had the 12yo Lot B, the Pappy 15yo and the 20yo).

Bottled at 95.6 proof (47.8 abv), with the most beautiful mahogany color. 

On the nose it is wonderful. Super sweet. Not a rye hint anywhere. Maraschino cherries, cotton, Maple syrup, Prunes, Liquorice and maybe a slight acetone note. The alcohol/acetone note makes it a good offer, believe it or not, because it is so delightful and sweet, that if you weren't perceiving this alcohol note you wouldn't think this is whiskey.

On the palate is incredibly rewarding. I kept it there for 30 seconds and it was superb. Bitter chocolate, Oily. Cherries bathed in chocolate, Herbal notes (romero), Pepper, Liquorice, Maple syrup. 

Aftertaste is amazing. A ginger spice bomb, but very pleasant. Your  whole mouth goes to sleep. Perfect.

Overall this deserves a 100 over 100, an incredible whisky, one of my favorites from 2018. Cheers!"
