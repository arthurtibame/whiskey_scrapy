4.5,Very soft - mouthfeel reminds me of the St. George single malt with but with a touch more honey and cream. Big whiff of smoke on the back end.

4.0,"The nose is a little peculiar, but I can’t specify what I’m smelling. Love the mouthfeel. Soft and thick. Intense, yet understated flavor profile. Well balanced malt and peet. 4.10."

4.0,"Vanilla, honey, dust, life cereal, and a hint of peat smoke on the nose. Palate is dried fruit, peat, earth, caramel, and grain. Reminds me of highland Park 12, but more...American? Very interesting stuff."
