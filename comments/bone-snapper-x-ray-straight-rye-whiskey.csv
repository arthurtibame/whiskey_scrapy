3.75,Wish I had known the proof before I put down the fist taste.  Spicy and fiery before an ice cube.  Sweet!  Still hot.  Classic rye but nothing more or less.

null,"Sourced from MGP, and it’s refreshing to see Backbone Bourbon Co. be straight and honest as to where they get their juice from. The mash bill is 95% rye and 5% barley. This bottle is labeled as batch #1 and bottled at 110 proof. On the nose are clove, nutmeg, cinnamon bark and licorice along with notes of banana bread, citrus pine, roasted peanuts, and coal fire. The palate is vibrant and explosive with intense peppercorn, cinnamon bun, toasted caramel, and honeyed candied ginger. The texture is sharp but rich at the same time. Killer value here."
