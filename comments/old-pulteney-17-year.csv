3.0,"Nose- Lemons, orange, sea spray, butter, caramel apples

Palate- Apples, brine, melted butter, vanilla, bit of spice

Finish- short, oily finish with notes of vanilla and spice 


Forgettable. The nose is fantastic, but the palate fails in comparison and is very simple and subtle. The finish is short and just okay. Would not buy a bottle of this."
4.0,"A rarity for me: two consecutive tasting days, though somewhat planned.  An opening volley with the Old Pulteney 21 and a closing shot with the Old Pulteney 17. 

A pale amber-yellow, almost apple juice in color. 

Fresh diced apples, pears and peaches in a candied syrup is the aromatic introduction.  As time grows, sugary notes of butterscotch, honey and vanilla.   There are wisps of sawdust and berries, sweetened, ripened plumbs and maritime brine. 

A sweet and fruity dram this one is.  In a lightweight body, like the nose, vanilla, butterscotch honey, Granny Smith apples, pears, lemons and berries.  There is some spice of cinnamon and nutmeg with ginger snaps that produces a prickly sensation. 

The finish is medium-long that is oaky-dry, wood spice with vanilla cream, lemon zest and ground cinnamon with a bit of deep warmth. 

As usual, a dash of water takes the edge off and sweetens the dram. 

“Picture yourself in a boat on an” orchard near an ocean.  Lol.  A pour that is most perfect for summer or early autumn days.  The nose sets the stage for the delivery and the finish slowly brings you to a blissful end.  Not as deep and rich as the 21 year brethren, but still holds it own.  Once again, unfortunately, another fine dram will soon no longer exist as this has been slowly extinguished.  As I may have mentioned, OP is a favorite of mine, but that’s mainly with the original range.  I only hope the successor are just as good. [90/100][$107][Tasted: 2/29/20]"

3.0,"Bottled 2015.  Time to have two old Old Pulteney’s, 17 and 21, side by side!

Some scotch aficionados regard the OP 17 as one of the finest whiskies of its time.  For me, this is not nearly that special.  It is, or was, very fairly priced, and that is enough to turn a scotch into a darling these days.

This is just a solid single malt.  If you don’t like this, then you don’t like scotch.  This is one example of a whisky where the spirit and cask characters are in perfect balance.  I think Arran 14 has taken over as that example, now that this is discontinued.  The nose is butterscotch and vanilla, with just the right amount of salt and herbs.  The palate is fruity and floral first, but the colors are understated, kept in check by the maltiness.  There is no smoke at all.  This is a scotch to showcase to newcomers that THIS is what is at the heart of the buzz around scotch; not a Macallan sherry bomb, or a Laphroaig peat stinker.

Despite the praise, this is a forgettable scotch.  I am SO spoiled for saying that!  But I have found so many equals that are cheaper and/or younger that illustrate quintessential scotchiness and that perfect balance between cask and spirit.  I already mentioned Arran 14; but there’s also the Mortlach 16 and the Craigellachie 13 as two other examples.  This just means OP probably used relatively inactive senile casks for aging this 17 years, and could have had more vibrancy with a younger age and more active casks.  

The OP 21 is a completely different beast several classes above the 17.

Score: 0 (forgettable) 
How much does a bottle cost: It’s been discontinued since 2017, but there’s still some on shelves in my area for $100-130 
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $100"

4.0,"Rich, bit oily,"
3.0,"Given the perfection of the caramel flavors on the 12-year-old, it's questionable whether a few extra years in sherry barrels can improve things. And indeed it's hard to argue that this is a better bottle. The honey notes are more emphasized -- candied nuts come to mind --  and the finish unreels like a fishing line hooked in a deep-sea catch. The spiciness of the barrels is pronounced but there's a somewhat astringent note at the end. Complex and intriguing, it's worth investigating, but you're more likely to come back for its younger sibling."

5.0,"4.6
Open and keep in bottle for 1 month. Moved to 4.3 - 1 drop of water. Nothing like it
1 more month.. upgraded to 4.5 Fantastic smell, sweet, nutty, unique, complex. Taste: very sweet, rich. Compared it to Glenlevit and Dalwhinnie, but tops both. Last drop upgraded to 4.6."
5.0,"I may have underestimated this the first time I had a dram. My initial impression was that it was good (very good, even), but too woody for my taste. Suffice it to say that ship has sailed; it looks my local bar is a bit into a new bottle, so I wonder if my previous experience was impacted by over oxygenation in its predecessor. Regardless, I was shocked to be able to smell the dram from feet away - the Old Pulteney ripe fruit explodes out of the glass. When you get a bit closer in, there are notes of wood spice, plummy dark fruit, nuts, and dark chocolate to be found. On the palate, this is the 12 year's slightly more sophisticated older sibling - the elements present on the nose all integrate perfectly into a rich mouthful of whisky, almost choral harmony of fresh fruit, dried fruit, nuts, spice, citrus peel, dark chocolate, and vanilla-inflected salted caramel. Its oily mouthfeel coats and lingers. I'm glad I gave this a second look; the price point keeps it from becoming a daily drinker (the 12 can maintain that honor), but as a treat...you betcha."

5.0,definitely a pulteney on the nose - little saltiness in the taste as well - cant decide which is better this or the 21
null,"Tried at The Irish Heather Gastro pub with John. Feb 18, 2017. 1st of a flight of 4.

$21/dram in house

The Pulteney distillery was created in 1826 as part of “Pultneytown” - a settlement built to house and supply fisherman during the herring boom in Wick. It’s the northern coastal location that gives this whiskey it’s slight saltiness and brightness. The 17 year is made up from over 90% refill Bourbon casks providing for the predominant flavours of honey and vanilla to balance with the coastal elements from Scotland most northern mainland distillery"
4.0,"I'm not gonna lie: the start is a little weak here. While the nose isn't off-putting, it really isn't inviting either, as you force yourself to strain your nostril, searching endlessly for a hint of something, anything. Luckily, the palate is mesmerizing. Hell, it feels like a smack to your face as your tongue is hit with incredible complexity all working together in perfect unison: mangoes, oranges and even acetone (yes, nail polish remover - love that smell). There's also toffee  and sugar towards a satisfying finish that really does make up for the slow start. I love it!"

5.0,"While a lot of Highland distilleries could be mistaken for one another, there is something quite distinct about this one.  I immediately noticed a pretty distinct sherry note when I first poured it.  If there's a region I'd imagine when drinking this scotch, it's Ko Sumai -- both in scent and taste, I detect a tropical fruit  sweetness, Chinese plums, coconut, lemongrass, and a floral penumbra.  The palate also has a fresh wood aspect to it, is a bit tannic (I get that signature waxy feeling on my front teeth with a sip of water after this dram), and a saltwater brininess that is another Old Pulteney signature.  The finish is warming and has some of the smokier, chocolate-like notes that sherry finishing sometimes adds, while still layering in those tart and exotic tropical fruit notes.  This is a high-end scotch, though I'm sad to hear that the distillery is discontinuing this expression and the 21-year old version due to lack of stocks.  I can't think of anything quite like it.  I must find the 21-year old before it's gone as well!"
4.0,"Nose - Salted vanilla butterscotch, hints of ultra sweet golden raisins, faint hint of grilled pineapples?
Taste - Creamy yet dry mouthfeel, black & white pepper spice mingle with a fruity vanilla cream, tiny hint of lightly bitter oak aged pear/apple cider.
Finish - Lingering pepper spice, long lasting lightly bitter oak aged pear/apple cider sweetness
Score - 87/100
Final Thoughts - So the nose on this was amazing, but I think it fell a bit flat once it hit the tongue. I was hoping for more of that salted butterscotch flavor, but I didn't get much of that as it was a bit hidden by the pepper spice and lightly bitter oak aged cider I got. Finish was pleasant but I think I was still hoping to get more of the salted butterscotch I got on the nose. Decent dram but I think I could find ones I enjoy a bit more for the price. Slightly edges out the 12 due to a more interesting nose."

4.5,"Nose: A light sweet sherry hint at first then the fruity notes become apparent – light citrus, orchard fruits, melon and berries. There are minty notes behind the fruit supported by a background of malty cereal with a touch of leather, tobacco and burlap funk (just enough to add depth). As it rests in the glass the nose deepens and becomes richer, with sherry becoming more apparent. [The dry glass is sherry, honey and light smoke and surprisingly like the dry-glass aroma of Highland Park 18].

Palate: The arrival is soft and sweetly spicy with fruity notes a pleasant texture.  There is a noticeable oak presence that rises in the development together with a rich, complex array of warmer spices - ginger, allspice, clove and cinnamon. There is a delicious vanilla-honey-sherry combination that flows throughout the palate and into the finish, and an earthy but fresh leathery quality.

Finish: Short and dry. The elegant spicy sweetness of the palate gradually merges into a mild salty aftertaste, which in turn finally fades out as sweetness.

A great whisky that for some is the standout of the Old Pulteney standard lineup but for others is overshadowed by the 21 year-old.

There is a strong similarity between this and its younger sister the 12 year-old expression, but this is more integrated and elegant with a well-defined sherry presence and some very agreeable oak influence that is lacking in the 12. Very much the 12 year old all grown up.

The nose is good but a little tight at first. It needs some time in the glass to unfurl and a couple of drops of water assists this process. The palate is, however, where things really blossom.  Give this one some time to rest in the glass – at least 15 minutes – and I’d recommend just a few drops of water.

“Excellent” : 4.5 stars"

4.0,"This is whisky for me in so many ways. It sets the heart pumping and the mind racing but also removes the world and leaves you in a place of quietness – until the glass is empty. Thanks for Cascade for the sample and the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that I've had the 21 year old at his place and that is as close to perfection in a glass that you will find. Nose is Lemon and floral notes with a breeze coming straight off a breaking wave.  Wonderful. Taste is intense and integrated. A medium long finish and alcohol warmth but refined...The nose implies this will be a citrus heavy and sweet floral dram when the reality is a salty and briny clash with vanilla and yes lemon....but finishing in oak tannin and complex spice. Its complex but also very much an integrated whisky - integrated is the word to describe this whisky and this is what makes this better than the 12 year old....which is a marvel as well but less cerebral and exciting at the same time.  The wood is much better quality and also more pronounce than the 12 year – and that’s what makes the 17 year old so good - there are layers and layers to peel back but you can also just sit back and drink it in. Loverly, loverly stuff – someone…anyone send me a case or make me a board member - please. 4.5 stars or 94."

4.0,"My good friend Paul wrote to me before I sat down with this glass. He gave me some  song ideas for the ""theme of the dram"" concept I like to do, and the first option is a great fit for this 17 year. ""Amber"" by 311, and it's going to be in my head all night now (lol). Good color, and a great nose. Maritime sea salt, fruit extravaganza, dark tea, and sweet roses. The palate brought a surprising creamy vanilla, fruit collage, nice amount of smoke, and honey. The finish is long, not overly dry, with sea spray, and orange rind/cherries. 4.25 and a real treat. Another reviewer stated it reminded him of the Balblair, and I agree that it's a dead ringer for the 1999 minus the salty floral notes. Thanks for the sample Everwind."

bouche. Caramel salé. point. où est passé la brioche? Aucune épice en bouche. le 46% permet une belle présence des arômes. je n'ai pas l'impression de dilution comme pour le 12. je m'attendais a des notes de Sherry plus dominante vu le jeu de PX et d'oloroso mais, rien de tel. la note de Sherry que j'aperçois est subtile et boisé, caché et adoucit par le sel très dominant. je n'ai pas l'impression d'un équilibre. c'est un ""salty-bomb"". frais et huileux. des amandes grillées au four. une chaleur.

finale: moyennement courte. sel et un sucre brun. laissé par un arrière goût de chêne.

overall : très plaisant en bouche. pas agressant du tout. j'ai du vérifier sur la bouteille le taux car j'aurais probablement misé sur un 43%. j'ai cependant l'impression que le sel est trop dominant pour révéler les notes fruitée du PX que l'on entrevoit au nez.

I sort of felt as if this was summer in a bottle.  You get this whiff of salty sea air and  crisp citrus fruits.  It’s as if you’re standing at a craggy Maine dock.  You can taste the mineral-y, slate-y backbone, all rubbed with sea salt and lemons.  Whereas the likes of Ardbeg and Lagavulin take you to cold North Atlantic sea pounded shores, this is reminiscent of gunpowder grey seas on a warm northeastern shore.

On the palette it's a soft and smooth entry with a complex array of orchard fruits. This leads to spice, citrus and woody notes. All the while we have a lovely sea air and brine note in the background. The finish is lengthy and adds dark mint chocolate, oak and a lingering brine note. 
It's like eating a fruit basket and dark chocolate on a breezy day at the beach. Quite a fun experience! The bad news is that this one is now discontinued so I am glad to have had the chance to sample it!

2.25,"Ending my reviews for today on this one - a bit lighter and frankly easier to review whisky. 

Nose - vanilla, sea salt, and nice oak. There's a light note of berry or fruit, likely from some very tired old sherry casks. There's a also a bit of a waxy vanilla, don't think clynelish but more just a muted and earthy vanilla. I almost get a juicy fruit element but not that exact note.

Taste - I get vanilla, oak, and a bit of salt (got more on the nose). Having had some springbank, it's really nice to see a showcase of just salt as I was starting to question if it was peated, yes there is a difference in salty and light peat and this one correcting my confusion. I get a light green apple on the finish with some earthy and savory notes. if I were to describe this it would be a lot of discussion on vanilla, clean, and yet salty. I generally don't get a clean malt flavor with salt but that's kinda what makes old pulteney so good.

The one thing I am coming back to is that I think the old 12 year 43% is a better whisky, I know crazy.This is more complex, the finish is longer, but man I miss that caramel and vanilla ice cream with cookie dough I got on the 12. 

It's a real shame this is no longer going to be made as well as the REAL 12 year. I really love what this distillery has been doing, but it's just a shame that we're going to see a decline in quality and an increase in price.

Anyway 2.25, a bit higher score than the 12 as the age and finish are better here. I still think if I could find the 12, even if price weren't a factor (and this bottle is 90 dollar more than that 12 I last bought). I'd still likely take the 12. Still whisky quality is more than ""do I like it more"" and here the 17 is a better made product. 

I am wondering however if I got an off bottle as I had a sample of this a while back and it blew my mind. I'm about 25% through this bottle and it hasn't come close to what I remember in that sample. So apologies if it turns out this was a dud and I under valued this bottle, that sample would have likely been a 3.25."

4.25,"My second selection on my recent visit to The Franklin Room in Chicago was Old Pulteney  21 (for the first, see my review of Compass Box Hedonism the Muse).  

I asked the bartender for a dram and he disappeared to get the bottle.  But he returned a couple of minutes later empty handed.  ""There's just a little bit left and it's been sitting for a while.  I don't want to give you that,"" he said.  

Appreciative but slightly disappointed, I faced the reality that i would likely never experience the 21 since it has been discontinued and doesn't seem to be available anywhere.

Undeterred from Old Pulteney, however, I shifted to the 17.  

This whiskey screams seaside in the summer.  There's fruit and oceanside breeze on the nose.  The palate is quite smooth and rich, with some dark fruit, salt, and mild oak, with a hint of chocolate on the finish.  It's well balanced and entirely pleasant.

Although i didn't realize it then, I've since learned that the 17 has also been discontinued.  Fortunately, availability is still good, so I'm going to to pick up a bottle soon."
