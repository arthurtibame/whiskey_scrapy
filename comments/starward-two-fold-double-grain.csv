3.0,"Not bad, just a tad young and spirity. The Aroma is a touch raw and young but has a great velvety sweetness; Palate has the same raw graininess but a richer sweetness and carries only a light touch of raw spirit; Finish is soft, smooth and sweet. The grain notes start low but build as it opens."

3.5,Adding a couple of drops of water really opens up the flavors.

3.25,Long nice caramel finish...
4.5,Totally underrated. A nice little cross between bourbon and scotch with creamy marshmallow and custard/sticky date. A bargain for a 46% Australian whisky. I could drink this all day.

4.0,"Gorgeous sweet and fruity nose (with hint of oatmeal?), a slightly bitter yet balanced and woody tongue-note, followed by a vanilla and almost-floral finish. Tastes higher-proof than it is, but that’s not a bad thing. 

Delicious whiskey."

4.25,"Somewhere between Balvenie Doublewood and Gretzky's No. 99 Red Cask. Fruity, balanced, and delicious, if not overly-sweet. A tad on the thin side, neat is my preferred pour. A steal at retail, if available."
5.0,Very smooth
2.5,"Sweet, tame, made for mixed drinks"
4.5,Really nice. Smooth.
4.0,"Not the strongest on the nose, but the complexity of the palate makes up for this: tones of dried fig and ripe banana. A very sweet offering progressing to an Everest of toffee before a long drawn out finish of creaming soda. Another interesting unexpected offering from the Melbourne-based distillery."

Definitely apple and cherry notes"

2.5,"Nose: A Fragrant grain aroma leads into light fruitiness backed by quite a bit of fresh, vigorous oak. A dash of vanilla and a little minty spice add interest. It's crisp with a juicy background and there's a whiff of apple Danish and lemon juice.

Palate: A nicely balanced arrival - a little sweet but with some developing spice. Mainly malty cereal to begin with, but as it develops some rather young and ""hard"" cereal emerges, which is the wheat spirit contribution. Just as you think it's over, a soft flourish of faintly fruity wine emerges to add sweetness and some mid-palate depth.

Finish: Medium. The predominant cereal flavours gently subside. There is a tannic and slightly bitter/sour cereal nip at the end that is coming from the casks and the grain whisky. A dash of water improves the palate and finish a lot by bringing out some more sweetness to add balance.

This whisky comprises 40% pot-still malted barley spirit produced by Starward, blended with 60% continuous still wheat-grain whisky produced by the Manildra Group at their distillery in Bomaderry in NSW. The two components are aged in ex-red wine barrels at Starward distillery. Although it is labelled as simply ""Australian whisky"" this is definitely what most people would call a blended whisky.

The nose is pleasant but lacks a bit of depth and authority, the palate is well constructed, if a little simple, and the finish is OK up until the end.  If it was a touch softer on the aftertaste this would be a fine blended whisky.  It is just acceptable for sipping over ice, but works best as a mixer - in fact it works very well with cola.

Overall it is very reminiscent of mid-range blended Irish whiskey.

Starward has created this blended whisky to capture a slice of the bar-trade and the upper-tier blend / lower-tier malt market. Their media releases specifically talk about it in these terms and it is priced at AUS$65 (US$47), which is uncommonly low for an Australian whisky.

This is the first major product to come to market from Starward since they moved to the new Port Melbourne premises two years ago, and was made possible thanks to substantial investment from a venture capital business backed by Diageo.  The distillery says it is aiming to produce 500,000 litres of alcohol a year from 2019 onwards, with half going into this blended whisky.  It will be available in the US and Europe from January 2019.

It's great to see a local distillery achieve this volume of production and create what is (I think) our first home-grown mass-market blended whisky. However it's a pity that the wording on the label is so coy.  I wish they had just come out and said plainly and proudly that it's an Australian blended whisky.

I can understand why they were timid about doing this, but together with the inference that it is entirely made in Melbourne (when in fact more than half the contents comes from 800km away in a different state) it all starts to smell of marketing spin, and that's a taint far worse than any off-note in the whisky itself.
 
""Average"" : 2.5 stars"
4.0,"Little to no hints from the nose. I guess I need to work on that. Sweet first impression that slides into something like black raspberry without the tartness.  Finish was slightly bitter on the back of the tongue and throat,  but not unpleasantly so."
2.25,"Vanilla spice, after taste of weak berries"

4.0,"Sweet smelling with vanilla. Very fruity on the first taste, red wine barrels come through. Follow up tastes are sweet with lots of vanilla and caramel. Spice but not too much. Nice to drink neat"
