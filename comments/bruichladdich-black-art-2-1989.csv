Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - So this was quite interesting in that it had a very pleasant nose. Very interesting funky fruit sweet and nicely balanced. This transitioned to the palate with a bit more funk which introduced something that I've gotten previously with the Dalmore Cigar Malt which I have mixed feelings about. It's this kind of meaty, funky, mushroomy sweet red wine funk that I have mixed feelings about. This also transitions to the finish that lasts for quite a bit.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
4.5,"Nose is outstandingly powerful.  Aromas of boysenberry, cake icing, and hazelnut.  On the palate, it’s quite dry and lean.  Peat is really light.  It is very darkly fruited.  Finish lingers nicely with what seems to mainly be salt.  Really unique, delicious dram."
