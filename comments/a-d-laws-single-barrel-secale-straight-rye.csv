5.0,The best rye in its price range in the market! Great rye notes with a few hints of a sweet toffee taste.
0.5,Kinda hated this. It has a tequila sort of flavor going on.

It follows through to the taste with a pleasant black pepper bit on the finish."

3.0,"This rye whiskey has thick watery legs and an amber gold color.

The nose is sweet and vegetal with notes of watermelon rind, green vegetables, cooking spices, dill, juniper, wet straw, and Smarties candy.

The swallow is harsh on the back of the throat, but once you get past that, one tastes sweet notes of caramel, cinnamon, cherry candy, and kiwi.

The finish is long, sweet, and oaky. Cheers!"
