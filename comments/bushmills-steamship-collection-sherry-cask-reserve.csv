3.25,"This is tasty and easy to drink, but flavors are all over the map, leaving nothing to really stand out.  Has smokiness, and a sweet sherry finish, and something makes me think of honey.  Smooth, almost silky, but a somewhat plain landscape."
4.0,"Mild nose, smokey start (after it opens up) and a sweet sherry finish.  Good tasting balanced irish whiskey, but I feel like it's a bit lacking in flavor."

A first steamship
I start a tasting of the 3 steamships of Bushmills before going on our tour. Oh, that's good! I'm starting to think about bringing back more bottles than the law requires. However, I will change my mind when I'll see the price. It is fruity, spicy, chocolate and legendary sweet. Totally within my taste."

4.0,"Thought I'd have a lazy Sat arvo with a bit of Whittakers dark chocolate (fijian ginger and NZ mandarin) and thought why not pair it with a whiskey. 

This one was a great match. Sweet green spiced oak, burnt toffee and a whole bunch more going on. It's abv belies a nice spicey punch which lingers long after the last drop is gone. At $75 fair to great value. Out of several drams tried today definitely the top."
3.25,"노즈: 셰리라기보단 과실향(청사과? 청포도)강함
팔레트: 오리지날 부쉬와 비슷핱 옅은 과일맛이 나다가 엄청 우디함 나무 쓴맛? 과일 껍질의 쌉쌀함과 옅은 과일맛, 다크 쵸콜릿의 쌉살함
피니쉬: 카카오 쓴맛 견과류 고소함, 약한 몰트맛
밸런스가 아쉬움"

3.5,"Smoother than Black Bush, with an elegant clean sherry finish very prominent and filling the whole mouth with a delicate glow. Pure satisfaction!"

4.0,"Here in Denver for business (unfortunately not skiing), and I noticed this sitting at the hotel bar.  Unopened, a bit dusty, and nestled between a JB and Redbreast.  Triple distilled Irish matured in sherry cask?  That’s not common, is it?  Either way, a worthwhile pour.  Light, sweet, but not too sweet.  With a nice hefty backbone of raisins and dark fruits.  Would I buy a full bottle?  Probably not, but interesting to try if you ever see it at a bar."

4.0,Sweet to the initial taste. Vanilla and sweet oaky flavor.
4.0,"A rather expensive drink, but is to be savoured and sipped slowly, enjoying each new flavour."
