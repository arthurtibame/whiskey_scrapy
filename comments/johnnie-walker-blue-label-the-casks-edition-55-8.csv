4.5,"A great expression of Johnnie Walker, a special blue label edition, legally a cask strenght one, bottled at 55.8%abv On the nose is a little strange, Bruichladdich classic laddie strange. Actually it is a lot like that one on the nose. Soap, Rice, Hands cream, Herbal notes. On the palate it was divine, Dry cake, Chocolate, Pepper, Prune, Smoky dim, Wasabi, Ginger. Complex and well crafted. One of the best JW. Not strong at all for a 55.8%abv. Finish is spicy, ginger notes. Overall this is a solid 93 over 100, but the price point is unpayable, and even if this is a good dram and the porcelain (or ceramic) bottle is lovely, it is too expensive. (Around 550$). Slainte!"
