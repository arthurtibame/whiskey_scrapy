4.75,"Blown away by this Rye. 
Starts off with Carmel and butter
Followed by the oak, char, and ends with a smooth light peppery rye. 
Best rye for the $ of 2020."

3.25,"This is a solid rye expression, it’s got a sense of rye grain on the palate, with some fresh mint, herbs and oak spice that compliments the bread palate as well. I do think it’s very distinctive from a lot of ryes, in particular ones with the MGP high rye profiles. Unique and really a journey for me."
4.5,I would like to know what Woodinville puts in this magical juice. Can’t get enough. Great rye flavor.

4.75,"Another favorite. Smells sweet and fruity. After it sits on my tongue for a few moments I find there is a sudden pop of fruit and maple. The flavor is lasting and has notes of light cloves, honey and cinnamon. The aftertaste has a pleasant caramel and apple."

4.5,"Cinnamon and leathery nose, smooth honey-carmel, oak finish with a solid bite for a 90 proof.  Will be adding this to the rotation for sure."
3.0,"Interesting and complex rye. Heavy pepper and spice notes. Strong licorice presence. Getting red fruits, even strawberries, on the taste."
4.25,Great liquid to learn the difference between “heat” and “spice”. I love this Rye.
3.25,"I enjoy the flavor, but I find it abrupt. There's a lingering tingle of rye on the palate, but the mouth feel is thin. It isn't very complex, but the flavors present are tasty."
