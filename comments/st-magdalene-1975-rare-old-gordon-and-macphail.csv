5.0,"Annus horribilis..yes 1983. 11 distilleries were brutally put to rest. Amazingly one company DCL was responsible for 9 of them. The distillery is now mostly residential flats. Only 164 of these bottles and I got to try one. Lucky me given a bottle is now several hundred $ plus if you can get one :-). Now I've drunk a lot of whiskey and I like full rich harder hitting flavours but I think this is stunning for how wispy and delicate yet so perfectly balanced. Often older ones get past a point and get ruined, this one is like a tightrope walker delicately balancing on a very thin highwire. 5 for me"
