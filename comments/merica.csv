1.0,Mix this with Coke. A lot of Coke.
1.0,"Not a very good sipper, strong, needs to be aged longer....a good mixer though

I’ll give it another shot for America !!!!"
0.25,I love America but this is one of the worst whiskies I have ever tasted.
3.0,"nothing exciting, smooth flavor, semi sweet"
2.25,Very young. Strong corn notes. Needs to be aged longer.
3.0,I will start off by saying I love what this company stands for but I’m not so sure about this one. The nose is probably what I enjoyed most but it tasted extremely young! Not bad but definitely young! It’s drinkable but should be priced at around $20 in my opinion. Probably won’t reach for another bottle when I finish this one.
1.0,Aroma is basically a fruity new make profile with a touch of wood and spice; Palate is basically the same; Finish follows suit. It smells and tastes exactly like you’d imagine a 6-month-old bourbon from MGP would taste and smell like.

3.5,Not the best but I love supporting Grunt Style and the veterans.
2.5,"Nice viscosity, vanilla and Oak, not super complex"
3.0,"It’s not that bad.  About on par with ancient age. It’s clearly sourced and the lack of transparency hiding behind patriotism is insulting but the juice, while forgettable, isn’t bad."
2.0,Decent. Nothing special but also not as awful as some reviews.
