4.25,"Nose - Tons of sweet orange, crisp cantaloupe, cinnamon. Lighter vanilla than typical with just a back note of fresh cut hay

Palate - Lots of oak, caramel, corn dust, vanilla fudge

Finish - Chocolate and molasses. Surprisingly short. Some lingering spice."

2.5,"Neat.  I believe this is sourced since the bottled says Western Reserve was established in 2015.  Shot in the dark, but I would guess Barton based on the nose.  

Nose reminds me of 1792 Small Batch.  Wood, caramel, dark fruit, hint of brown sugar on the nose.  On the taste it is very thin.  Hint of those sugars and caramel.  Hint of spice.  Not much on the legs.  Nothing offensive or off putting about it, easy to drink but not much flavor to latch onto either.  

Unfortunately the bottle design is the best part of this.  Too expensive for what it is and I regret dropping the money on it."
