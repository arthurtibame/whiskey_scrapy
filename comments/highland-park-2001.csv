3.0,"Nose opens with light citrus peel as well as some honey and floral notes. Light with a slight medicinal tinge. Front palate is immediately bourbon like, ashy with a mellow alcoholic burn that travels up into the nose. In the mid palate it develops into flavours of caramel, citrus and even ginger before revealing a light peaty note signature Highland Park in the back palate. The finish is of a medium length, fragrant and bitter. Tastes to me like a Bourbon with an interesting peaty finish, drinkable but nothing too complex or outstanding."
