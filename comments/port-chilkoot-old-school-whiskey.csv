2.5,"Light with a very clover honey sweetness over an ethanol smell and a funky green evergreen note. On the palate it has more of the honey and the evergreen note with not much of the ethanol burn and a faint vanilla. Finish is short and smooth. It's triple distilled like an Irish Whiskey, and has some of the cleanliness of that style but feels a little young. Overall a valliant effort, but the evergreen note is off putting in this case and the interesting honeyed notes aren't enough to overcome it."
