3.0,"Sometimes I feel terrible reviewing whiskey here, because I read everyone else's opinion and hate to be the contrarian. But alas I must, though in all fairness I should disclose that I do not generally like rye whiskies. Here's a related set of questions: do you like pickles? How about dill? Or vinegar? Oh and garlic? If you answered no to any of these questions, WALK AWAY FROM THIS BOTTLE! Do not pass go, do not collect $200! As improbable as this sounds, the nose has dominant aromas of dill and vinegar, with a touch of pickles (yeah I know, sounds crazy). The palate is lumber, like walking through a Loews lumber yard on a humid summer day, and the finish is long, which is either a good or bad thing depending on your opinion about carpentry. I actually don't dislike this whiskey. I'm just confused by it."

5.0,"The grand-daddy of widely available American straight ryes, without a doubt. A blend of 6- and 16-year-old straight ryes, Rendezvous mixes the liveliness of a good, young rye mixed with some of the mellow elegance of a good older rye. At first there are a lot of flavours I associate with LDI rye: dill, pickle, menthol, something ""gin-like"". But then those mellow and it really starts to come together into something softer, sweeter. Caramel, ginger, vanilla, watermelon. Cinnamon, candy corn, bubble gum, caraway, brown sugar, custard. Creme brulee and tropical fruits. A hint of pencil shavings. Taste is, considering its two high-rye mashbills, surprisingly soft, creamy, and sweet."

5.0,"Nose - Hits you with the typical rye notes of rye bread, mint, dill. Then you get vanilla, caramel, a very buttery creme brulee, then something oddly refreshing, like a bosc pear.
Taste - Attacks your tongue with a spicy cinnamon. A hint of mint and cocoa nibs make their presence along with the fruity pear from the nose, followed by a very buttery vanilla ice cream.
Finish - Cinnamon spice lingers, like red hots or a buttery atomic fireball, but without the artificial sweet but more of the vanilla butter / creme brulee.

Such an amazing dance of mellowed, matured, woody, and carmel-ly (peaches?!) sweet along with the slightly subdued spicy backbone of a younger rye. Although I think EH Taylor rye is amazing, I'd rather have a Rendezvous with High West  given the chance."

5.0,"Bottle opened on 21st wedding anniversary for a celebratory dram.
Nose: mint, molasses, vanilla.
Palate: low viscosity, crisp clean mouthfeel (the young rye?) but at the same time a deeper spicy complexity coming through. Sweet, bright, fruity tones only just breaking through - almost out of reach. Woody, vanilla, mint, aniseed, light tobacco deeper complexity also there. Nicely balanced. Long finish with lingering spiciness, light heat and subtle sweetness. Great finish! 
Some water just toned everything down but didn't really open up anything new.
Neat, slowly savoured and sipped is the way to go with this one. One for the top shelf in my view."
3.0,"[07.19.2016] My 100th review after the United Airlines (no)flight from hell. Solid but nothing special. Heat and barrel with typical rye. Not impressed. 

This is sweet and cherry sour like pricey cough syrup. Nose is a lot of barrel that mixes with vanilla, floral spice (is that a real thing???) and a fair bit of heat after a few stouts. Good, but not repeatable. A table of 4 is unanimous."

Blend and mashbill (via their website):  A blend of older Straight Rye whiskeys ranging in age from 4 to 7 years.
Straight Rye whiskeys: 
95% rye, 5% barley malt from MGP
80% rye, 20% malted rye from High West Distillery

Nose: caramel, honey and vanilla greet you, followed by well-rounded rye spiciness along with hints of dill, dark fruit and nutmeg.


Taste: deep and complex, with caramel and vanilla initially but as it develops, you get oakiness, dill, zesty rye spice, light tobacco in the background.


Finish: long and spicy, with the oak char becoming more assertive with a hint of maple and brown sugar. 


Value: at $45-65 USD, this one is worth it.


Final thoughts/Score: High West is doing some amazing blends, and this one is no exception. It's a complex, versatile and easy going sipper I recommend to anyone getting into rye, especially if you are a bourbon-first drinker, as the bourbon notes of this blend really shine, coming likely from the older rye. Great neat, can stand up to ice (if that is your thing) and would work well in a cocktail. All this said, when originally released it was blended 16 yo rye from Barton, but has been replaced by their in-house distillate. This earlier blend must have been a real treat, so if you can find an older bottle (earlier that 2017) it's a must buy!

4/5: highly recommend buying a bottle.

5.0,"As soon as I sipped this rye, it instantly vaulted into first place among all of the ryes I've tried, which admittedly is a much smaller number than scotches or bourbons.  The blend of two differently aged whiskies has produced a complex set of aromas, but all of them delightful:  cappuccino, caramel, rye spice, pineapple, and butterscotch.  Then even more flavors pop up in the palate:  creamy oatmeal, dill, vanilla, and citrus notes.  The rye spice is quite strong in all three phases, but manifests most strongly after the swallow, when it combines with yeasty bread flavors, mint, and orange.  At $60-70, this is not cheap, but it's much richer and more complex than its more affordable cousins."

4.0,"Was in the mood for a Rye today, and this was the first Rye I grabbed. I've heard good things about it, and I have to say, they are true. The nose starts with an intense smell of mint-chocolate sweets, some cloves and a very interesting layer of aloe vera. Fresh and spicy, unlike any other Rye I had before. I don't get any of that chocolate in the taste, but there is still a lot of that fresh and spicy mint, a nice satisfying base layer of roasted brown sugar, some anise and other rye spices and quite a bit of heat. Not very sweet, but still enjoyable. The finish is medium long and rather on the spicy side, again typical for Rye in my expierence. It is a bit more expensive than for example Bulleit Rye, but it's worth the extra money. I'm curious how the Double Rye will compare to this."

4.0,"I assume most on here are familiar with Rendevous Rye, but for those that are not, it is High West’s higher end, older rye (they also make a less expensive Double Rye, amongst other things). It’s sourced juice from MGP and Barton, but High West is very open about this and is a leader in transparency about its production process.

Age: A blend of older straight rye whiskeys ranging in age from 5 to 19 years.

Mashbill: 95% rye, 5% barley malt from MGP; 53% rye, 37% corn, 10% from Barton Distillery; and 80% rye, 10% corn, 10% barley malt from Barton Distillery.

Abv: 46%

Price: $53.99 at Total Wine in Houston, Texas

Setting: Neat in a Glencairn, with a fat basset hound dozing next to me.

Nose: Big aromas of dill pickles and rye, with some secondary notes of cinnamon, vanilla, and brown sugar if you search for them. (21/25 points)

Taste: Very consistent with the nose. Dill pickles and rye. (44/50 points)

Finish: A medium length finish of rye spice and oak with a pleasant alcohol burn. I also get a flavor I’ll call mint, although that may not be the best descriptor. (21/25) points)

Conclusion: If one enjoys pickles (as I do), then this is a highly enjoyable whiskey. If one doesn’t, then this probably tastes pretty vile. As such, I’d only recommend this to people who fit into the former category. Regardless, this is a well-made whiskey. All three components are solid, and it is just enjoyable to drink. It is fairly expensive for an American whiskey, so I won’t be in a hurry to replace my existing bottle when I finish it, but I am glad I purchased this bottle.

I will just drink great bourbon and sip Sazerac 6 for a night cap every now and then when I need a change of pace.  I just can't see $75 much less $85 for WP 10yr.

Delicious and immensely drinkable.  Rye spicy but not full of the black licorice taste that is so prevalent in ryes.  For me, the dill note comes and goes.  I like when it’s there and tend to miss it when it isn’t.  From my calendar computations, I believe this batch still includes both varieties of the Barton 16yo juice on hand at High West.  Wish HW would communicate exactly when the 16yo juice was replaced by in-house stock in RR the same way they did with Double Rye.  If I found another 2017 bottle I’d likely buy again."

It's not really different from the taste profile of other bourbons but it does it very well. Perfect balance and beautifully crafted.

Dbl Rye in comparison is aged 2 to 7 yrs. What a letdown... I'm a fan of the HW Double Rye and at $40 it's a good value as well, so I was looking forward to trying this ""better"" bottle of rye from High West, still thinking it had older whiskey in it. This bottle has changed over the month I've had it open. After a week it tasted refined, mellow, lower heat with nice oak making just enough presence. I kept waiting for it to improve and wow me; but now after 3 to 4 weeks open (and 3/4 empty) it has taken on more heat and an over the top oak bitterness that wasn't there before that I do not enjoy - really went downhill. In summary I enjoy more exciting flavorful whiskeys than this - Pikesville is a great example at $10 less. I also enjoy the HW Double Rye more. This was refined and balanced for the first two weeks and an easy sipper (but underwhelming), so if this appeals to you just plan to finish your bottle before 3 weeks. Too much oxidation is Not kind to this one. I wont be getting another bottle."

4.25,"Batch 13J30

Found a 375ml bottle today of this older batch from 2013.

Nose: a lighter nose with dill, caramel, oak, rye spice
Palate: hits easy with classic Bourbon barrel notes initially, followed by a nice punch of rye spice, and with a fainter dill element than what’s on the nose. The flavors really pop, but are very coherent. Medium viscosity, and the heat level matches it’s proof.
Finish : medium finish similar to the palate flavors, but with the rye spice and light dill note reminding you that it is a Rye, not a Bourbon.

Overall, this is a quality Rye that is well balanced and just sips so damn easy I can’t stop refilling my glass. The downside for me is the state minimum price of $69.99 for a 750 ($37 for the 375)..... lots of stiff competition in that price range. Interestingly, the store had 750’s of the 2015 batch at $54.99, which scanned at $69.99. Of course, they wouldn’t honor the old sticker price (bastards). Oh well, I’ll just enjoy this ‘baby’ bottle and decide if I want to go back for the other 3 that were going unnoticed on the shelf."

3.75,"Pretty mild nose of dill, ginger, clove, citrus, rolled oats, and a tinge of ethanol.

Palate opens with butterscotch and honey transitioning to orange peel and a woodsy oak in the mid-palate, but then cuts right to the finish. Flavors aren’t particularly rich or punchy; they are just kind of “there”.

Spicy medium length finish features black pepper, cinnamon, anise, and dill with a kiss of mint. Mouthfeel is light and soft. 

A “sweet and spicy” rye that isn’t particularly herbal, this makes good showing with no real flaws, but also doesn’t knock my socks off. Which brings me to the price; at $58 this is overpriced for a “just fine” experience. High West Double Rye is a bolder, more herbal, and ultimately more interesting whiskey for about half the price. Misses the re-buy mark for me."
