4.75,Slightly sweet. Great nose.
4.75,"Balvenie 15: This is absolutely delightful. The nose tastes like toasted caramel. Sweet and peppery, with an incredibly long and smooth finish. I have trouble believing that this isn’t a fine bourbon"

5.0,"You can smell the sherry on the nose, and fresh sea air, as well. The mouth is sweet and salty, with subtle sherry and vanilla. Aldehydic on the back of the mouth, but balanced. Amazing."
