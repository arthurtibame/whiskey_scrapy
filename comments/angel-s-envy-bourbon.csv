4.0,"Nose: Brown sugar, spice, and honey roasted peanuts.

Palate: raisins from the port barrels, with more brown sugar and spice, and some vanilla wafers. moderate sweetness. a little heat

finish: warm spice, moderate length

4.0,"Nose
Rich, vanilla, Cherry and dried fruit.  Oak and a sweet astringency.

Palate
Thinner than anticipated on the first sip, although following tastes seem to improve in this area.  I'm having difficulty picking out individual notes, but the overall feeling is pleasant.  I'm getting some raisin and quite prominent oak.  Not as much wine/port flavour as I would expect, which isn't a bad thing.  

Finish
Medium length.  Port flavour comes through in the finish.  Residual caramelized bitterness in the back of the throat. Tannins presumably from the port cask are present but not overpowering, and, to be honest, not as forefront as I would have expected. 

Overall a very enjoyable drink"

3.5,"I sense a whole lot of fruity flavors, with pretty minimal rich, vanilla, butterscotch type flavors. If you're into clean and sharp, fruity orientated whiskeys then this would be an excellent option. But if you're after rich, full bodied flavor and creamy mouth feels, this simply isn't the best option. I'm rating 3.5 simply because it isn't a bad bourbon, the flavor isn't 'bad', it's just not what I seek in a whiskey. A bit thin on the mouth feel as well. Looks pretty on my shelf, but not so sure how often I'll grab a pour of it."

3.5,"In direct taste test vs. Four Roses (4R) 

Both are really good and have very similar profiles.

Despite having a slightly lower proof,  the Angle’s (AE) had a more pronounced alcohol smell,  and seemed thinner on the tongue.

By comparison the 4R had a richer nose and taste;  and is my winner.

If had more AE, I’d set up a blind test to confirm my impressions.  Feel like I may be shortchanging AE in that regard. 

They are very close, but the 4R has a distinct cost and availability advantage; which provides me with some comfort in making the call with limited head-to-head tasting."

3.0,Buttery and smooth on the palate. Chocolate notes. Not much warmth or finish. Delicious for an easy sipper.
3.75,"Copper in color early hint if mint in aroma. This leads to cherry and a touch of raspberry. Sweetness noted and a slight moment of smoke.  Flavor brings along the cherry ads some spice, notably clove and black pepper.  As I work through the glass some dark chocolate notes emerge. After adding a few drops of water, milk chocolate steps forward and the lingering flavor is of cocoa.  I'd say my favorite notes here.  It's good, but I prefer other bourbons more and definitely prefer their Rye to this."

3.0,"Color: a tad on the lighter side, more tan/gold than brown

Legs: decent pace of formation, good spacing around the glass

Nose: sweet notes from the port finish, light oak, buttercream and a tad of pepper/space

First sip: easy on the front of the pallet, spicy towards the back and warm on the way down. Not overly but a very light burn letting you know it's there

Taste: smooth, no real strong tastes, pretty even and dare I say bland?

Finish: ultra smooth, nothing intense to note, really good bourbon for those that don't like the spice of a rye.

Overall: I don't think the value is there for a $50 bottle, it's decent but I think there is more hype than hope with this one.  Good marketing and reputation."

3.5,"Cool whip, cool whip whipping cream, that's what you'll get with this one. You'll also get a hint of that port wine finish when you swallow, and it is very friendly. When I drink bourbon I want a hit bourbon, this one hits you or just glazes you as a bourbon. Meaning it leaves you wanting more, you wish there was more, but the volume on this one is a little to quiet for me. I like the concept of port wine finishes, but this whiskey is like a muscle car, with a V6 engine instead of a V8 engine, you wish there was more there."

2.25,"Smooth and fruity with plenty of sweetness. There's a little spice here in the forms of cinnamon and white pepper, but it is not overwhelming. Surprisingly, there is almost no wood or smoke here. Vanilla is noticeable but not overwhelming and there are some floral notes nearer to the finished that are mixed in with the minerals. Tartness is present, but it's minimal. The flavor is mild with some mineral backing, but the notes it has are good. Not super exciting, but enjoyable.
The nose is woody but wet and has a bit of rich red fruit, as well as some rye and spice. The palate is musty with some gross wood coming through strong. There are clear mineral notes, but there's also some nice dark cherry hanging out a bit along with some caramel that doesn't not taste like butterscotch but is not obnoxious either. There's a bit of spearmint that reminds me of mothballs and therefore grandpa's house. There's a fair bit of numbing clove too. It has an interesting profile going on, but the traditional wood, char, fruit, and caramel notes aren't all that great and the other flavors are odd. I appreciate the added fruitiness, but the result is kind of like a more subdued Old Forester Signature with some added spearmint. There's a dab of chocolate, but it's mild. Gross bread does make it into the finish. There are all sorts of syrupy sweet flavors that remind me of Arta Anejo, but that is is a questionable profile to begin with and certainly isn't what I want in a bourbon. There's complexity for sure, but the flavors are a mess. It isn't all bad, but this drink has a lot of faults. This is interesting and wants to be hedonistic, but it doesn't quite work. Still, I could sip it."
3.0,"Very sippable bourbon. Low proof makes it that way in my opinion, plus it smells sweet and tastes sweet as well.  Not overly sweet, a very good sweet taste."
1.75,"May be an unpopular opinion, but at this price range, I expected more. I've tried many bourbons that finish their last few months/years in [something else], and every one of them were stronger in proof and priced lower. 
It does have ""delicious"" flavors, but a bit of too much flavors, and I feel it loses it's identity as a bourbon. It is enjoyable, and I can understand people liking this drink, but for this price range, I would have at least expected a minimum of 100 proof and the feel for a bourbon. Sorry, it's just overrated to me. Won't be a repeat buy, but welcome, if offered."
4.25,"Nose: Vanilla and brown sugar 
Neat: Vanilla, caramel, a little fruit
Rocks: Same with some maple"
2.0,Smooth taste with a big bite good mixing bourbon
3.75,"Batch No. 71K; Bottle No. 164

This is one I've conveniently skipped over due to price and scarcity in NC. But when I had the chance to pick up one in December, I figured might as well because I wasn't sure when I'd have another opportunity to buy a bottle.

The nose is a burst of stewed fruits. Dark, ripe fruits with added sugar. Reminiscent of a pie filling. It is similar to a light- or medium-bodied red wine that isn't dry on the palate. Similar to pinot noir, merlot, or grenache. Honestly for a 86.6 proof whiskey it smells really good.

I can see why a couple of my friends consider this their favorite ""bourbon."" It contains a rich, sweet fruit flavor that you do not get with most bourbons, especially at this proof point. I taste dark fruits, sweetness (combination of brown sugar and molasses), and a noticeable oak spice. The oak spice builds a little on the finish as well with hints of corn dust. For 86.6 proof it clearly punches above its abv weight in flavor. I've seen multiple reviews say this is corn-heavy, and I get almost none of that on the nose or palate.

I've enjoyed this bottle, but I still think it is overpriced for what you are getting. Before I finish the bottle I may try to buy the Isaac Bowman Bourbon Port Finish for comparison. It is $15 cheaper in NC, thus, if it is comparable in flavor then it's a no-brainer purchase when looking for port finishes."
