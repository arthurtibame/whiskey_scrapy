4.0,"If you look in at this beautiful single malt, you’ll notice thin viscous legs clinging to the glass walls and a dry straw gold color shining out.

The nose is sweet and Speyside-like, It’s beautiful. There are notes of malt, strawberry milk, dried grass, honey, caramel, and mild mesquite smoke.

The palate has a more watery mouthfeel and sweet fruity notes of caramel apple, peach, lemon, apple skins, and BBQ char.

The finish starts with an initial heat then turns sweet like Smarties candy.

This is one of the tastiest American Single Malts I’ve had thus far! I really like the history of the distillery, vision behind the product, and dedication to local resource use. I definitely recommend and am excited to try more of their products. Colkegan, well done! Sláinte!"

4.5,Absolutely beautiful nose on this. Single barrel expression of Colkegan spends an extra year aging in apple brandy casks. It's a little sweeter than the regular expression but balanced nicely with that very gentle smoke and slightly spiced apple finish.
