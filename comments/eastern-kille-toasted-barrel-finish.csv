2.25,Bland. Nothing special
3.0,"Good color, the legs come down quick around the glass but the top where the bourbon just reached the peak, took a long time to fall. 

The nose outside of the traditional oaky smell has almost an apple or cinnamon scent hiding beneath a powerful 124 proof.  It tastes a bit under aged and if you leave the bourbon sit for a while on the tongue it seems to dull the senses a bit. Inhaling while it rolls over the tongue will take your breath away. 

Although it's got the oak and the Carmel, the proof is almost too overpowering to really get a good taste. Combine that with the youth of it, and the way I look at it reminds me of riding a moped; it's fun to try but you don't want your friends to see."
4.0,"Brown sugar and a touch of spice on the nose, toasted barrel gives a great smokey/oaky initial flavor with a touch of fruitiness and a bit of sweetness, easy smooth finish for a 123 proof"
