4.0,"Dark, viscous and brooding in the glass. Earthy, raisin aromas. Explodes in the mouth with a burst of devilish smoke and heavenly minced fruit. The embers glow sweetly while you contemplate your next sip. A dash of water reveals figs and black grapes on the nose, tames the brimstone, and exposes some drying tannins on the finish. Fiendishly good."

4.25,"Damn this is a very fine dram. It just got better and better. 4, 4.25 and touching 4.5. I reckon with more time it may have gone from 4.25 to 4.5 to solid 4.5.

Salty, barbecue, fig, orange fruits, smokey aftertaste which warms your mouth well after the whiskey is consumed. I'd love to work through a bottle as I reckon it could be the next Bunnahabhain 18 type sleeper hit which over a year just keeps getting better. Although saying that after time open I start getting that cat pee flavour unique to bowmore which grows prominant. Still i have to call it on what I have and at $250+USD I think a 4.25 is fair. I could get nearly 3 Bowmore 18s for that price."
5.0,"I am a very honest man when i rate whiskies. Everybody who knows me, know that i am not a friend of bowmore. I find their expressions not that peaty and most of the time, boring.

Well, this is a monster whisky. A powerful dram, the best of what Bowmore ever offered me before. 

Lets star with its lovely story, this ""The Devil's Cask III, Doble the devil"" is an incredible one, ill just transcribe it:

The church in Bowmore was built without corners so that the Devil could not hide. One evening, the locals chased the devil out the church and he ran into Bowmore Distillery and hid inside casks bound for the mainland. These casks subsequently became 'The Devil's Casks.'

AMAZING TALE. 

Well this is the 3rd release of the ""Devil's Casks"", the first one was matured in oloroso sherry butts and the second one in Pedro Ximenez Sherry casks.... well this one has BOTH OF THEM. Now we are talking.

Bottled at 56.7%abv, with THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BURNT UMBER / CHESNUT REDDISH COLOR. Mouth-watering just by sight.

On the nose is sublime. Sherry bomb, Peatiest bowmore ever, Cherry, Strawberry marmalade, Figs, Salt, English sauce, Dark chocolate, Oranges. So many aromas, so many different ones.

On the palate is perfect. Oranges followed by a very pleasant spice bomb; infused by a heavy Sherry note. Glazed Pork, Oak. 

Aftertaste is super long, with an ashy burn, ginger and salt. After the first sip your mouth will be totally slept... like forever. 

Overall, this is an experience. This is what whisky should always be, lots of things going on, a full mouth sensation, incredible. One of my (now) favorite whiskies ever, 100 over 100. Slainte!"

4.5,"Tonight's Pre Turkey Day Whisky is one of my personal favorites from the Islay region of Scotland!

This is a limited and somewhat rare release from Bowmore Distillery. According to lore (at least how Bowmore spins it) this whisky gets its name “from a legend nearly as old as the distillery itself. It was claimed that the Devil was once spotted and chased through the town, eventually hiding away in the distillery. After searching, the Devil was nowhere to be seen, having made his escape in a whisky barrel.” 

As for what's in the bottle, you’ll find a blend of whiskies that have been matured in both Oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. This is what is at the heart of the Devil’s Casks series, and for the final release there’s two unique things of note: it is the first time Ximénez sherry casks have been used by the distiller, and also the first time this spirit has been double matured. Putting all of this together, you end up with a 56.7% ABV whisky that’s deep mahogany in color!

Let's dive into the the tasting:

On the palate it's very rich with lots of dark red fruits upfront. Smoke is in the background with dark chocolate as well. Fruit cake and a salty peat note. It's very big indeed but oh so smooth considering the proof. The finish is long and adds oak to the lovely rich smokey dark fruit chocolate notes! Really well done! 

I highly recommend any fan of big Sherry and Peat seek this release! Cheers All!"

4.5,"Nose is wet leaves, Red Hots, sugar-cured bacon, honey-glazed ham, baked salmon, and red licorice. In the palate, the sherry and peat both become more present, with cracked pepper, black cherries, rubber, blood oranges, Band-Aids, and faint coffee yielding to a finish of mild campfire smoke, lingering unsweetened cocoa and more of that savory roast flavor. Finish is medium long, and the dram coats the mouth well. A minute pondering the roof of my mouth with my tongue and the coffee and chocolate get the final word. A really unique whisky, in no small regards due to its highly unusual nose."
