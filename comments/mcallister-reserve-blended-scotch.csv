1.75,"Nose: A somewhat rubbery sherry note. The merest hint of fruit and oak.

Palate: A sweet but slightly hard arrival. Not unpleasant but very ""ordinary"". The palate has little development other than some generic ""whisky"" notes. The texture is nothing to speak of, but it's not horrible.

Finish: There was a finish?  Sorry, I blinked and missed it.

The nose betrays the presence of bottom-grade casks but to be fair this is a perfectly adequate bottom-shelf blend. I recently reviewed 1495 blended whisky here, and this is marketed by the same people (Pinnacle Drinks). It's their ""better"" blend and yes, it is most definitely better. Less rubbery and grain-centric, more satisfying all round, and worth the extra AUS$3.

Let's get real for a moment - there are a lot of good folk out there who can't afford anything other then the bottom shelf. For your money, mates - this is an OK blend, but if you live in Australia I'd advise you to spend just $1 more if you can and buy Loch Lomond Reserve - it's the dog's balls at this end of the food chain. You won't be disappointed, I promise.

""Adequate"" : 1.75 stars"
