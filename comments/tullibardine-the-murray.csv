4.0,"Fragrant nose, with wine must, black pepper, vanilla, and cantaloupe coming through before you take your first sip. Medium bodied, with fresh grapes and citrus notes over the palate. The finish is long, spicy and fairly smooth, even at 56.1% ABV. Overall a complex and delicious dram."
4.0,"If wine finishes are your thing, this bottle is for you. It's ""Shut up and take my money"" whisky.

There's fresh grapes, wine must, vanilla, a certain pepperiness, and oak. It all comes together superbly, with a finish that is quite long."

3.0,
4.25,I don't understand why this is so lowly rated. CM and Joe are on the money. This is a quality dram. 20 was good.  Sauternes was crap (prior to my Dramfest dram and then in slightly upgraded to average). This was very good. Perfect balance. I'm a sucker for first fill bourbon and this delivered. I had no idea what abv this was until the distributor told me. I was amazed. 4.25. Update I bought this for $75USD vs the $160 I thought it was. Much better VFM!
