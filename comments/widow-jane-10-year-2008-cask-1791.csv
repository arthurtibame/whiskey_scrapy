5.0,"Vanilla, light smoke, cherry and very warm"
4.25,"When I saw this bourbon won GQ magazine top bourbon I thought uh oh window dressing / lip stick on a IBC (externally sourced bourbon) pig. But hey this pig is Smoooth.. with a capital S for those who are reading this after a few to many. Yes it has that Dr Pepper 'I want to scrape off my taste bud thing', but cracked open and from the customary first sip before time and water I was like hey this doesn't need any of that.  Call it manufactured (which I guess of course it is) but they do it well..and it is from a single cask so new make, cask and time influenced only. Limestone water apparently is the difference... one of those now I read it it's in my head moments as I'm like yeah that comes through. Sweet mellow oak, lime, cherry etc. Definitely on the dessertish side.... and did I mention smooooth. Ok maybe the litre of craft beer (a USA NZ brewer combination which was very good) prior is impacting my judgement, as complexity... think about the poor little missing complexities but hey the balance is perrrrfect, taste is great and right now it's ticking all the boxes."
