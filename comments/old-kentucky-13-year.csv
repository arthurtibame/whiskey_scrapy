3.75,"1989.  Aromas jump out of the glass with powerful suggestions of butterscotch, caramel and toffee.  Flavor consists of mainly toffee and caramel with a touch of fruit cake-like spice.  Mouthfeel is fairly thin and finish is short.  This isn’t as good as other I’ve been tasting from this era."
