Pleasant to drink but very short finish."

3.0,"* Review transferred from the listing for Naked Grouse, now that an appropriate listing has been made.
          
          Nose: Sherry, fruit and a tiny hint of smoke.
          Palate: A smooth but firm entry with a little bit of spice. In the development it becomes stronger with sweet and spicy flavours.
          Finish: Medium, sweet and lightly spiced.
          
          From mid-2017 The Naked Grouse has been a blended malt marketed as the Edrington Group’s answer to William Grant's Monkey Shoulder. Don’t confuse this with the older Naked Grouse, which was a scotch blend.  The seal around the neck of the bottle will clearly say either “blended Scotch whisky” or “blended malt Scotch whisky”.
          Reformulating it as a blended malt did not change it a great deal as it is still based on Highland Park and Macallan malts, but of course previously it had a core of grain whisky. I’m not certain which one, but the Edrington Group owns North British, so it was probably that. There is honey, light fruit and a touch of smoke from the Highland Park, stronger fruitiness, spice and sherry from the Macallan.
          It’s not so much what the whisky has gained from becoming a blended malt but what it has lost, which is that typical “ethanol” and slightly bitter/metallic taste that comes from mass-produced column still grain whisky aged in tired casks. The removal of this has given the whisky a softer and more relaxed palate, and a better finish.
          It’s a good malt blend, and for me it’s better than Monkey Shoulder (which has a more toffee character) at the same price. It lacks the delicacy and clarity of the lower range Compass Box blended malts, but is equal to their blended scotchs.
          The only fault I found was that after the level got down to half-way it started to oxidise strongly, and became a little sour and bitter. The honeyish tones disappeared. It’s one to use up fairly quickly as a mixer.
          “Average” : 82/100 = 6/10 = 3 stars."

4.0,"The nose is distinctly Macallan. Sherry, raisins, burnt sugar, orange peel, and caramels. Lovely. Arrival... sweet, mouth watering, orchard fruits, table grapes and barrel tannins. Finish is medium with lingering oak and a light spicyness. In the war of the blended Malts this gives Monkey Shoulder a run for its money. Now if only Edrington could work out their distribution issues and make this more readily available..."

3.0,"Pleasantly surprised by Naked Grouse.  Didn't really know what to expect, but I was in the mood for something sherried and not too expensive.  This one delivered!   Nose:. Slightly sour, sherry, plum, a bit of floral spice from the ethanol due to the youth, mild peat smoke, heavy butter Caramel and vanilla.   Palate: Medium barely sugar, salty, sherry, slightly youthful off note, hay, lots of dried apricot on the finish with mild peat...The finish is mostly all oloroso sherry.  Anyone who's familiar with Sherry will know this taste.   Definitely a younger blended malt, but  after some time in the glass the ethanol vapors evaporate and leave you with something smelling like a  10-12 yr single malt with a nose somewhat reminiscent of a younger Maccalan.  A definite winner for me!  
        
        Note/Update:   After drinking decent 12 year olds all night and coming back to this,  3.5/5 may have been a little generous...I'd give it a  3 now, if that.  Definitely can't compete with the likes of Bunnahabhain 12...But it is half price and on it's own, as a starter quite good."
5.0,"Very nice sipper. Best mixer ever. Absolutely Delicious!  Aroma is full of dried fruit, a bit of peat and oaky goodness. No oily or other off flavors. Superb balance."

3.0,"Nose : sweet malt, candied fruit (think the kind you would put in a fruitcake), a bit of barrel wood.
Palate : lots of malted notes, some oak, some honey, noticeable but not overwhelming smoke. The oloroso influence is not very apparent in my opinion, it's more present on the nose.
Finish : short to medium, tangy, a bit astringent, some more smoke.
This is a very fair whisky; not necessarily my dram of choice per se but still enjoyable, and it doesn't have a lot of challengers at that price point. Stock it for everyday use, as a kind of ""working horse"" scotch for those times when you need something nice but don't want to break the bank."

3.75,"Nose - Heavy wet sherry influence, raisins, prunes, chocolate covered cherries, dark chocolate, toasted sugar

Taste - Sweet syrupy raisins, prunes, cherries, hint of milk chocolate, brown sugar simple

Finish - Lingering dark syrupy sweet dried fruits, light cinnamon spice

Score - 80/100

Final Thoughts - This is fairly one-dimensional and that's sherry sweetness. That's to be expected as I think they designed this blend to be used as a mixer. I can see this being a bit too sweet to drink neat unless you use it as a dessert dram, but otherwise it'd be great in a highball with some lime.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, as a cheap sherried mixer"

4.0,"Really, really liked this one. It's a blended malt and is kind of a poor man's version of Compass Box Spice Tree blended malt. Not quite as bold and full, but very fruity.  Vanilla, pear, peach..some oil. Not very peaty or smokey, but full and satisfying."

3.5,"Popping the tight cork, a blast of honey and caramelized sugars floated out of the pretty bottle. Vanilla and a whiff of musty grain. A very inviting nose and even breathed deeply - nothing signaling the immaturity expected at this price point.

On the tongue figgy sweet and a dash of woody spice. Overall mouthfeel and flavor is light with a short finish that finally unveils the youthfulness bottled here. Amidst the slightly spicy fish a faint aroma of raisin toast.

Overall a hell of a deal for the price and a guiltless and happy dram! For my tastes the sweet and feisty nature of Naked Grouse bests the easy going and conspicuous Monkey Shoulder for a value tier drink."

3.0,"Rather sweet, dried fruits and a little oily on the nose. The sherry influence carries from the nose to the palate with butter, dried fruits, vanilla and a little cinnamon. On the tail end, sulfur comes into play, adding a light smokiness to its rather short but sweet finish."
3.0,"Butterscotch or caramel, fairly one dimensional and simple but dangerously smooth. For the price a great deal."
3.0,"As someone learning to appreciate peated, smoky drams, this has a hint of that but is more of a well rounded link between a Speyside and a mild peated HP or similar. Dangerously drinkable, I actually wished for something in the taste to slow me, more complexity, but it is very smooth.  Maybe what you are looking for, easy to drink without much thought, but not a contemplative dram.
I did enjoy it (more?) with a bit of peaty, smoky goodness in my own blend."

4.0,"This is a nice vatted malt. Nose is sweet honey-biscuit and sherry with a touch of smoke. The taste is true to these and lingers long on the follow-through. My bottle is 43% ABV. There is no age statement and you can tell that the malts in this blend are probably 6-7 years old; but, still a nice dram. It is not available in my part of Midwest USA (near KC, MO) so I shipped it in from the west coast on the chance that some reviews I had seen were correct--and they were. It is worth the $29 plus shipping. One of highlights for me is the fresh sherry influence on this blend, so many taste like old raisins to me."

3.25,"The aroma is very thick and massive, with distinctive notes of dark chocolate, coffee beans, some coriander, nutmeg, salted peanuts, unkempt dried grass. It reminds me of an old, scuffed, threadbare paper soaked with port wine.
A little bit sharp and spicy on a palate: cloves, cardamom, cinnamon. Some chocolate again, some bread and malt, soy. It is still very solid, consistent, thick and even a bit heavy as an old dusty carpet.
Some acetaldehyde notes appear in the finish, as well as greek yoghurt, pine nuts, vegetable oil, yet still the certain spiciness remains to be present. The aftertaste is palpable though not very long nor pleasant.
As a sum - not very complex nor varied but decent blended malt worth of a praise. It shows a certain character though the majority of values commonly found in single malt whiskies are buried deep down in a quite poor balance, spirituous-ness and overwhelming ""wallop"". But it is optimal for its price and it certainly wins over other representatives of blended malt whiskies market (yep, I'm talking about Monkey Shoulder).
Well done, Naked Grouse, but it's not quite enough to buy you again."

3.25,"Have to admit the 96th% ranking on Proof 66 caught my eye. Then RobertWayne gave a nice positive review and I read it had Macallan in it so I had to try it. Poured neat, nose is malt, canned peaches, buttery apple turnover with some barrel. Good mouthfeel brings on palate of malty apricot and apple with charred wood. Its a little hot due to lack of aging however flavors are solid albeit tad thin. Finishes with fading malt, drying wood, char and sugary pear. This is a nice tasty fruit profile scotch. Not super complex or deep but enjoyable.....83/100........Can recognize the Macallan influence here but its NOT a budget version. Vatted malt blends are superior to most standard blends as the grain twang is removed"
