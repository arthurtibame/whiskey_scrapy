5.0,"Nose: Upon this aroma we detect lush fruits, likely from berries either black or blue, or very likely both. Subtle notes of honey and maple also fill my nose, along with dried fruits – apricot and currants. Notes of vanilla and some caramel are there and finally some brown sugar. Whoa, that’s quite a nose for a younger whiskey so this goes to show you that Lustau sherry is a wine of exceptional quality, it is no surprise that these great whiskey and wine houses wanted to collaborate.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Palate:  On the palate you’ll notice some rather nice cinnamon flavors here along with woody spices that are common among bourbon & sherry cask matured marriages. It’s rather creamy and there is a nuttiness to it as well – almonds and pecans. There is a toasted quality here you pick up from the wood as well, with barley being among these flavors and some caramel along with what tastes like sweet fudge.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Finish: It carries on and on and on…light notes of banana, and soft oak thats firmly present throughout the finish.  I would say that much like a sauterne wine, you don’t need to eat anything after dinner with this – this is the dessert.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

*With water*

Nose: The vanilla is much stronger here, but the fruits are hidden away now. There is a sudden scent of apples, red and golden with a slight sensation of citrus on this fellow that I missed the first time around, however most of what I mentioned the first time around is still here.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Palate: More spices make their way here, along with vanilla which is stronger now.  The palate feels more crisp now, with notes of pears and on the way out it seems a little more hasty to exit your palate.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Finish: Not as long with water, but it lingers on in its own way.  Creme brûlée starts to appear now closing out in a very creamy finish.

Bourbon and House Rating: 93

w/ water: 89-90

4.0,"It's a nice full bodied whiskey with the classic Irish pot still traits of cereal notes, licorice, caramel, and vanilla.  At first the dram begins quite nicely with a strong oaky burn thats incredibly lengthy and dry.  However, as with most iterations of young pot still, when it opens up the oomph of this whiskey gives way for something basic in which I think this whiskey falls apart.  I'm rating this 4 starts because shortly after I drank some thin watery Elijah Craig, and you could feel the difference in mouthfeel no problem!"

4.0,"The score for this one on Distiller wasn't the highest so I held off buying for a fair while. If in doubt I consult josh aka http://thewhiskeyjug.com as he's someone who seems most uncannily to mirror my taste in whiskey. He loved it so I dove in for $80usd a bottle and was very happy. Having thought about it I really shouldn't have hesitated as Irish Potstill and Olorosso Sherry bombs are two of my 3 favourite whisky styles (Islay peat rounds out the trifecta) and I haven't gone wrong with any potstill out of Middleton yet (ok Greenpot didn't wow me but not a fail). This ticks all the right boxes. Creamy potstilish viscosity, spicy sherry. Great drop...now not perfection there is a slight note that sometimes doesn't ring true at the end but definitely a 4.25 at least"

3.0,"""Redbreast fans have long cherished our whiskey's sherry notes"" says the audio commercial for this bottling, and...well, yes. The sherry-tinged quality of Redbreast is probably its best known trait. It plumps up the dram, giving it a rich, fruity, nutty roundness lacking in, say, Green Spot. And, in Redbreast's best iterations, it's a delight - I think about the 15 year old. This NAS (the youngest whiskey in the mix is 9 years old, or so I heard on WhiskyCast) is finished in first fill sherry casks..and things go from pleasantly round to REALLY plump. Like, me after my third piece of pie at Thanksgiving plump. The spicy, toasted bread pot still quality that dances with the sherry notes in the standard bottlings is lost here; instead, there's almond, marzipan, a medley of dried fruit. There's more ""young spirit"" nip here than in the age statement versions, but it's far from the worse NAS offender on this front. I've vacillated on a rating; I settled on a high three stars since it's an enjoyable dram, but not quite up to the high standards I hold for Redbreast."

Neat—I got strong breakfast cereals, a touch of berries, but couldn’t detect any noticeable wine influence from the Lustau.  It’s a mild Irish, was hoping for a stronger wine influence.  Decent whiskey, good introduction to a pot still that’s finished in wine."

Bold fruit, sherry, and sweet-tart oranges.  All the strongly-flavored finishing casks make a fine spirit, but it lacks the rich, thick elegance of the 12. Kind of like pop music vs classical.  Catches your attention... but you’ll have forgotten about it next year while the 12 is timeless. Given the retailer was asking $25 more for this one, it’s a no-brainer."

3.25,"I thought it high time I did another head to head tasting. This time around I'll be reviewing the four widely available expressions from Redbreast: the 12 year, 15 year, Lustau edition, and the 12 year Cask Strength (CS). I'd love to include the 21 year in this lineup but my wallet can't handle that sort of hit. If any of you fine folks would be willing to send a sample it'd be most appreciated. I'm also curious as to your opinions on my rankings and whether or not you'd rate these differently. Redbreast is one of my favorite whiskey brands and any of their expressions are worth having in your collection.

This edition looks the same in the glass as the 12 year (maybe a little lighter). On the nose, it smells younger and a little more astringent (as expected for a NAS expression), but you can also smell more of the sherry influence. The taste is noticeably different. Much more sherry on the palate, and a lighter mouthfeel. The finish isn't as long as the 12 year, and it comes in a little more hot. Overall it reminds me of a less interesting version of the 12.

For today's tasting I'm rating this #4  out of 4."

3.5,"Appearance: A caramel copper color tints this Irish whiskey. Thin, extra viscous legs cling to the inside of the glass after a swirl.

Nose: Fruity and honeyed is the overarching theme of the nose. Notes of dark plum, dried apricot, lemon, a dustiness, cut hay, sugary candy, and peach tea all contribute to the bouquet.

Taste: I heavily agree with our friend, Mr. Phillips - the very first sip is a big punch of fruity flavor. Like Rocky Balboa wearing a Latino fruit hat punching you in the face while you’re eating a fruit salad. Notes of pineapple, tangy orange citrus, sweet red apple, pear, watermelon, caramel, and honey decorate the palate. There is an oily body and mouthfeel that’s nice as it helps those flavors stick around for a bit.

Finish: The finish is long with a honey sweetness aftertaste that rises then eventually fades after the swallow.

Thoughts: This variant of the Redbreast family is very good but not quite as complex and at the tier of the 12 year old. I still would recommend it and if fruity whiskies are your wheelhouse, this will very much deliver! I can see this being a great spring and summer choice whiskey. I also think the proof on this one was a great choice! Watering it down does it no favors. Midleton, thanks again! Sláinte!"

4.25,"On the nose I am immediately reminded of Lustau Oloroso Sherry, which is one of the few bottles of Sherry I have actually tasted before.  Rich, dark aromas of dried fruit, prunes, figs, marzipan, slightly smoky toasted oak, savoury spices and a hint of licorice root and floral hints.
-
To the palate it has a creamy viscosity to it, very spicy with sweet, syrupy sherry notes.  Strong European Oak flavours resembling new oak, very nutty, savory, woody and spicy.  There’s also a floral note that reminds me of young rye, but must be raw barley.
-
The finish has a lingering Sherry sweetness, but the dominant flavours are of spices and toasted European Oak, giving a very leathery, dry finish.

4.0,"I smell all the traditional sherry notes like dark fruits, but deep down I still get the traditional Irish nose of shortbread cookies. The taste is a delicious blending of sherry with redbreast"
4.0,"Toffee, prunes, figs, dates, and dark, jammy fruits are right up front. The nose is quite dry despite the intensity of the fruit. There is some nice oak hinting at some barrel notes to be discovered underneath all of the sweetness. The palate is significantly brighter than expected, with the dark fruit bringing along some sweet apple and intense spices. The fruit and the spice turns almost leather and tobacco as it lingers, but it always stays just on the side of the fruit. There is a bit of shortbread cookie underneath everything giving some foundation, with the buttery sweetness blending smoothly with the oak still lurking in the background. Subsequent sips found a flaky biscuit right up front before the fruits charged in. The finish is medium with the oak gaining more prominence. Breathing in sharply after swallowing fills your mouth with a beautiful cinnamon and clove apple sugar that is perfectly balanced by the wood. The finish is ultimately an aged, dry oak that has been used as a cutting board for dark fruits over the long years.

**After only the initial taste, I think I prefer this to the Redbreast 12yr (also reviewed) as it has quite a lot more to discover. I'd be willing to say that this is an Irish for bourbon drinkers, while the Redbreast is an Irish for Highland Scotch drinkers.**"

3.75,"Great Irish. This guy takes the 12 year’s amplitude and kicks it up a notch. Less toffee, more dark fruit, like plum or cherry, more alcohol. But here’s the thing, I can’t tell that the alcohol is there as much as the 15 year, which is the exact same proof. And that’s a positive in my book. The linger is almost as long as the 12 year, and nose is more fruity. Combine that with the slightly amped up body and presence of the sherry butt and his guy grades out right alongside the 12. Afterthought: man I love how that dark fruit washes over my palate and just sits there."
3.75,"The best Redbreast I’ve had! 

Excellent aroma, can barely taste the alcohol, although a 92 proof. Fullest, yet smoothest flavor. Finish and linger make you sit back, close your eyes and just grin to yourself.

The flavors are oak, plum, and that grass that grows on the bluffs above the beach, you know, constantly bent over from the sea breeze and catching that bit of salt from the air.

Would buy."

4.5,"Redbreast Lustau is a NAS single pot whiskey. The whiskey is matured between 9 to 12 years in a combination of ex-bourbon and ex-oloroso sherry casks, before being vatted and finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts from Bodegas Lustau in Jerez for an additional year. Non-chill-filtered, it is bottled at 46% ABV. It pours a light amber touched with a reddish hue. The nose is spice and honey and a backdrop of ripe plum and fig. In the mouth those same flavors burst forth, first the honey and spice of the pot still, and than the fruitiness of the sherry influence which is full and enveloping. It is at the point you begin to notice the gentle warmth of the 46%ABV.. I am enjoying this very much. I am not going to say this is better than the wonderful 12 year old. However, it is perhaps as good, and is different enough to warrant a space in your home."

Dec. 7:

Much like Old Bardstown, I have been excitedly sitting on this one for a very long time. Hoping it was worth the wait!

Nose is absurdly bland. This is a sherry finish, right? I can only get a bit of yeast and brine.

Body is a different story. Wow. So this just changed things. Body hits smoothly. I get salted peanuts up front. Deep raisin follows. A bit of that brininess is there, but after tasting that raisin, that’s the nose. I go back and get that sherry influence on the nose every time. I have no idea why I couldn’t get it before. Perhaps I was expecting more redbreast and less sherry.

Finish is long. There’s black pepper, and the sweetness comes back from the raisin. I’m not a fan of the mouth feel on the finish. I’m getting the heat from redbreast with a syrupy sweetness. It’s confusing.

They really took a play out of Balvenie’s playbook here. It’s not just reminiscent. Without any knowledge going in, it would’ve probably been easier to convince me that this was Balvenie doing something screwy with their recipes than it would’ve been to convince me this was a redbreast product. 

Overall I enjoy this drink. I guess I see how this could be in a weird, undesirable zone. If I wanted Balvenie, I’d pour that. If I wanted Irish whiskey, I wouldn’t want this. But that doesn’t change the fact that this is unique, interesting, and at times confusing.

I don’t know if I actually have 24 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."

3.75,"Color is reddish Amber. Nose is pot still oil, oak, and a little sweet, with subtle fruit notes (fig?). First sip is mildly oily, with contrasting notes of pepper and honey. Finish is moderately long with pepper and spice lingering. Solid, but I found the 12 Year Cask Strength to have a better flavor profile at a similar price point."

4.0,"Nose: Christmas, cognac right off the bat—grape, vanilla, fruity and rich. No alcohol burn at all, smooooooth. Hints of oak and of cinnamon. Transported me to a small cottage in a forest in the winter. Fantastic.
Body: wow. Thick and round, a blast of warm spice. Mouth-coating, peppery and explosive, not smooth as I was expecting.
Palate: veeeery unusual. Cinnamon spice, somewhat nutty, oak, almost bourbon-like. Fire.
Finish: mouth coating. hints of menthol, veeeeeeery spicy, bitter, long-lasting."
4.0,"Notes remind me of burnt toffee...creamy, smoky, caramel. Reminds me of Jameson Black Barrel but it’s sweeter and the smokiness from the bourbon barrel is better balanced."

4.5,"This is one of my favorite whiskeys, and is one of the first ones I ever tried.

It starts with the scent of sweet cream, a bit of vanilla extract and icing. The taste gets sweeter with white chocolate and pound cake. It's kind of like a confectioners dream.

The finish tastes presently of nutmeg and vanilla milk."

4.0,"Heavy wood and fruit on the nose, with the familiar buttery, shortbread-like, slight vanilla. The overall effect reminds me of rhubarb pie. 
The first taste that stuck me was the strong pepper at the back of the throat and up the nose, which took me yourself by surprise. I had just tried the very mellow 12 and was expecting more of the same. Similar slightly sweet buttery notes, but overlaid with fig, and citrus.
I was surprised to learn that the Lustau is 2 years younger than the 12. It's more complex, interesting, and overall enjoyable."

3.75,"I grew up with the taste of the Irish and Canadian whiskies so popular and common in the eastern MA region where I lived in my DNA. I still have a taste for both, and I'm definitely a Red Breast fan.  It's a lovely drink and I've pretty much had one or both RB and GS on my shelf for at least 6 or 7 years now.  I've not tasted this expression before now.

Tasted neat from a glencairn.  Allowed to rest about 5 minutes after the pour before evaluation.  

The nose is sweet with candy aromas - noughat, caramel, and honey.  Theres a rush of ripe fruit - cherries and apples, plums, figs.  There's a fair amount going on in the glass.  

On the taste buds this is dessert in a glass.  The flavors deliver what the nose promises and this has a full spectrum of fruits and sweets layered over a creamy foundation of well aged malt.  There is a good barrel influence and a nice warmth to the intermediate-length finish.  

If you like sherry finished whiskies, this will definitely fit the bill.  I do, and it does.  This is a great guilty pleasure and I""m sure it will find its way into repeat rotation.  An above average dram, for certain!"
