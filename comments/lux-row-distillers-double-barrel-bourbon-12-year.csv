3.0,"I've been struggling to do this one and I'm not sure I'll hit that save button but lets write this one up and see. 

So I had this a while ago and really loved it, but I couldn't really recall WHY I loved it. So I bought this when I found it for 150 + 500 points...later fond it for 156 and no points, oh well. I also first gave it a shot next to ECBP B520, review coming and thought they were oddly similar. So been drinking a bit today and writing some reviews (I'm starting to collect a plate worth of un finished bourbons in front of me), and figured this being high proof maybe it was time to give it a go while other whisky that isn't ECBP has been with me. 

Nose - so this is odd but I'm getting a super vegetable note. Perhaps rye and oak are creating that one. Normally with a double oak I get a lot of chocolate but that's 100% not here. It's old oak, what I'd call tired oak on a scotch, and there's a rich body but it's still giving me that vegable note. 

Taste - yeah this is super oaked in a very interesting way. There's also a tootsie roll like element.  It's a fresh or young oak element with huge amounts of sweetness. It's a drying bourbon, high proof, but not barrel strength. Complex for sure, but it's missing the mark a bit for me today. 

I'm going to save this as this isn't my first pour and every time I do this one I come up feeling it's missing something. That said it's so rich, it's so big, it's bold, and while I am finding off notes, it's got some really wonderful bourbon sweetness and flavors too. They're just not best suited to be compared with other bourbons. You know I'm now getting like a waxy chocolate note and some butter scotch. 

Very enjoyable bourbon 3 out of 5 but the alcohol is a bit unchecked and the oak has some issues that I think will put some off. I'm still enjoying it and glad to have a bottle. I'd buy again but only if I see it in a few years, it won't be a quick rebuy."

4.75,"I tried this at the distillery , it was rich and sweet with notes of.carmel and baking spicy finish I wonderful. So good I bought 2 bottles."
4.5,"This was absolutely fantastic!  Sweet cherry and vanilla on the nose and sip, and plenty of heat on the finish to allow you to sit back and savor each sip.  Truly unique.  So glad I stumbled upon the release while in town for the first time."

4.5,This… this is nice. The Aroma is about as classic as they come but in a rich and heavy way; Palate rolls through similarly but with a larger herbal and spice punch; Finish is a dark and fruity dream.
4.5,"Sampled this at the distillery. Very nice. Rich, sweet and spicy. Warm but not harsh. Very layered."
