4.0,"Ballechin's peatiness is not like Islay peatiness or even Talisker peatiness.  It reminds me in some ways of Port Charlotte, although with a better nose, best described as an intense mixture of leather and earthy funk.  It is not a smoke-like scent, it's oilier and more organic.  The palate is dominated by that oily, earthy, almost savory note as well, like a grilled portobello with a mildly sweet glaze.  The finish is medium in length and, again, perhaps because I'm sensitive to earthiness, I don't recall many notes other than that funky, alluvial flavor.  This is not a particularly sweet whisky, so could be an interesting pick for someone who enjoys Octomore but is overwhelmed by the ABV or peat level of that strange dram.  I'm going to give it a decent rating because I found it quite unique and am glad I tried it, but Ballechin would not be a daily dram for me."

Edradour, mon amour!
Mon frère qui est un amateur de whisky fumé et de la distillerie Edradour, ce produit a simplement été fabriqué pour lui. Je dois absolument mettre la main sur une bouteille pour son anniversaire au mois de juillet... Je vais essayer de faire jouer mes contacts."

4.0,Love Islay Whiskies. This is a perfect Highland equivalent. Taste stays in the pallet long after your finished the dram

2.75,Nose is a beautiful marriage of peat and fruity sherry cask. Taste is surprisingly light and non-oily with a touch of peat. Finish is on the lite side.

3.75,Great amount of smoke. Has a mineral aftertaste that lingers.

3.75,"Light caramel color - clings to the glass. Thick and oily with nice legs. Smoke, peat and a bit of honey on the nose. Peatiness backs off with a little water while honey and sherry notes come through - nice balance. Long finish."

2.0,"A one-dimensional whisky with peat overpowering every other note. 

There's peat, with a touch of peat and hints of peat. If Zeus grants you the ability, you may also get hints of cut grass and citrus. The palate is kinda sweet, with some pepperiness and Malboro. The finish is bitter and unpleasant. 

Skip!"
