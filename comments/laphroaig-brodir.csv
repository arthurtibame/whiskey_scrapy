4.0,"Strong phenolic smell characteristic of Laphroaig, contrasted with quite fruit flavour."
2.0,"It's Friday, which means whiskey day!  Yes---I have one dram only on Fridays and Sunday's.  Rest of the days, it's green matcha tea.  That math alone explains why I've built up 150 unopened bottles over 10 years...anyway...When I saw this on the shelf at the whiskey bar in NYC, I immediately ordered it.  Paid $15 for it.  I so much wanted to like this, and had high hopes just because of the Laphroaig  pedigree.   You ever immediately go watch a Scorsese film just because it's Scorsese?  Most are great.  Then there's a few that may end up as misses.  This is one of those misses.  The nose is like gym socks.  And not in a good way.  But those that just are way past due to be in the laundry.   Normally I love the  Laphroaig nose, but not this one.   Taste is oranges and brine.  Fruity, briny, smoky.   Finish is sharp and bitter.  Like what you'd expect eating an orange skin.  I'm glad I tried it, just because I'm a huge Laphroaig fan, but not sure I'll be buying a bottle anytime soon."

I love it!!!"

5.0,"After the somewhat disappointing Flaughter I needed something good to quench that peat fever I've got going, and Laphroaig usually delivers. Also, Port finish. I'm a sucker for Port finish. 
    
    This might well be the best Laphroaig I've tasted so far. Better than the Lore (as far as I can remember, need to revisit that one). 
    
    The nose is very clear Laphroaig. Slightly medicinal peat smoke, surrounded by a strong berry note and the salty sea air of Islay. The spicy and sweet notes actually work really well together. 
    
    The taste is something else. Reminds me of a sweet berry tart topped with glazed bacon. Doesn't sound like it should work, but by god it does. There is also a healthy dose of pepper in there to give it a bit of extra kick, as well as some briny salt typically found in Laphroaig. 
    
    The aftertaste is slightly sweet and smoky, like strawberry jam on a burnt black toast. It lasts for a long time and let's your mind stay in bliss. 
    
    I really need to pick up a bottle of this. And I need to find more Port cask finished stuff."

3.5,"Laphroaig tasting evening, Sydney, 26 September 18. Whiskey #6.
        
Nose: Rose and honey. Raisins simmered in port and brandy - a hefty and full aroma. Wine – strong port wine, almost like port wine jelly. The smoke takes a back seat, but it’s there all right, as is a hint of the trademark Laphroaig iodine, but it’s occluded. There is a deep musky note tinged with oak sitting behind everything.
        
Palate: Velvety smooth arrival. Raisins and smoke in abundance, strawberry compote, blackberry jam, orange syrup, rancio. A rather thick texture, but not oily. It’s flavourful but on the braggadocio side and heavy-handed.
        
Finish: Medium. The smoke persists in the finish.
        
It’s a boldly sweet nose and the port finish obscures the smoke at first.  Peat-reek is present, however, as a powerful foundation and once it starts to unfold it keeps on coming. Unlike many smoky whiskies there is no trace of a plastic-peat note on this at all.
        
On the first tasting I found this whisky agreeably sweet, friendly and easy to drink but with each successive nose and sip it became less engaging. Something about the profile just doesn't appeal to me and by the end of the dram I was over it. I can’t imagine ever buying a bottle, particularly given the price.
        
There was a port-finished Cairdeas a few yeas ago that was exceptional – sprightly, balanced and complex. This comes across as a less competent version of that. It is well made but just not to my palate.
        
“Good” : 3.5 stars"

3.25,"On the nose very gentle peat, malty sugary, slowly the peat becomes more present, apricots, white ripe grapes, the longer you let the nose develop the more vibrant and full of variety it becomes.

The palate comes in two very different stages. First an intense and mildly bitter spice mix (allspice, juniper, ginger ...) and a citrusy marzipan Taste without being sweet. Then it becomes typical Islay flavored - earthy and moist peat, campfire smoke, straw and wood. 

A little water smoothies the nose out quiet a bid by releasing fruits and dried plums. I feel like it is becoming sweeter as well. 

I like it. 

Edit: after reading other reviews I have to state that I don’t know what port wine, iodine or tobacco smells like. So I can’t reference them."
4.0,"Even if Laphroaig never dissapoints, this expression feels like ""more of the same"" even if there is a nice sweetness to it. The typical Laphroaig peat sometimes is way overpowering in front of other flavors and even if you are a peat-head like me, sometimes i wish there was something more to it. 

Brodir means ""brother"" in Norse, and it has been matured in ex bourbon casks to then be finished in ruby port casks. 

Bottled at 48%abv, tawny color.

On the nose: instant Tobacco grass. Brown sugar, Orange candy and Perfumed peat. Burnt grass. There is a thick sweetness under a peat fog/ layer.
After 5 mins, iodine and super medicinal aroma appears. All sweetness has been lost after a while. Cigarretes smoke. After first sip some vanilla and burnt hay. Even for those notes, it is not that pleasant on the nose, without been bad or off-putting.

On the palate, first sip is very Sulphuric.
Orange in the mouth walls but very raw flavor in the first sip. Second sip was much more sweet and refined;  Some oranges and brown sugar. Cough syrup. (I am so addicted to it).

Aftertaste has a smoky pleasant finish. 
Salty and oak spice, pretty nice. Nice puffs of smoke. 

Not the best Laphroaig but does its job. I would have expected a lot more complexity for a 48%abv. The sweetness is very thick and refined due to the usage of ruby port casks. My score: 85 over 100."
2.5,Not my favorite. But good for a peaty scotch

5.0,"Review for Brodir Batch 3 (aka Final Batch).

After trying Brodir bath 2 and Cairdeas 2013, I already knew how amazing port finished Laphroaig can be, so when I had the chance of buying the new and final batch, I jumped on it. (I think from now on it will be replaced by a new expression called simply “Laphroaig Port Wood”).

First difference I can notice from batch 2 is on the color. Although it has the pinkish hue one would expect from a ruby port finish, it is less pronounced than it was on the previous batch, probably denoting a shorter finishing time on the port barrels.

On the (amazing) nose, there are red berries and campfire smoke as the previous one, but also vanilla sweetness and honey. It is delicious and seems overall more rounded this time. I really love it!

On the palate, the campfire smoke turns into an ashy peat bomb with an underlying sweetness. Surprising, but in a good way.

The finish brings a lot of barrel spices to play, that along with the peat seams to linger forever on your mouth.

I liked it better than batch 2 for sure, since it is an overall more balanced whisky, but if I recall it right, not better than Cairdeas 2013, still King of Laphroaig IMHO.

Very, very good indeed! Happy I pulled the trigger on this one. 5 stars it is!"

5.0,"Getting an early start on the bonus samples for round 6 of the SDT with this travel retail exclusive Laphroaig provided by Mr. @LeeEvolved.  Brodir is the brother of the PX Cask but finished in port wood vs PX. Bottled at 48% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of a beautiful ruby red with a purplish hue. 

The nose is sweet, fruity, wine drenched peat. Great classic Laphroaig notes. Smoke, bandages, iodine, campfire ashes, rubber and tennis balls. Sweet wine notes, mixed berry jam, grapes, plums. Maritime notes, seashore, salty sea spray, mineral like seashells. Wine soaked oak, a touch of eucalyptus. Berry pie, very confectionary towards the end with a hint of pink bubblegum. A very good nose indeed. 

The palate is SLIGHTLY less engaging. Strong peat smoke and bonfire ashes. Oak, black pepper. Sweet, berries, grapes and a light tobacco. More smoke and candy sweet. I started enjoying this a little too much for any further analytics, so let’s just say it’s damn good.   

Medium to full bodied with a light oiliness, mouth coating and dry. 
The finish is long, smoky, sweet, earthy and meaty. 

This is great stuff. The better looking fraternal twin of the PX Cask that gets all of the attention from the girls in high school. If I see a bottle at duty free I will be sure to grab one. If this is the lesser version of the 2013 Cairdeas, then I will have to pester Lee into finding another bottle to open so I can have a taste!  A solid 4.5
Cheers"
4.0,"This is Laphroaig’s attempt to take their port wine finishing up to another level.  It’s a travel retail exclusive that’s actually on its second batch run.  The first run was back in 2012 and was a precursor to their excellent 2013 Cairdeas release, that has become a mythical, lengendary drop over the last couple of years.  In an attempt to recapture that magic, Laphroaig re-released this bottle in hopes of a return to glory.  The problem is that this one falls significantly short.

It’s bottled at 48%, is non-chill filtered and has no added color.  The color is actually quite striking:  orange/amber.  It appears oily while leaving lots of droplets around the upper edge when you spin it in your Glencairn.  There are very few legs that form, as well.

The nose is sweet port wine, light grapes and honey with a pretty restrained smoke level.  There’s little to no wood or alcohol notes present, even after 20-25 minutes.

The palate is similar:  Light vine fruits with hints of smoke, but it is juicier than most Laphroaig’s I’ve had to this point.  It’s not so much oily as it is watery.  You can tell there’s young malt at play here, but the port flavors keep the harshness at bay.  The overall mouthfeel ends up feeling a little thin.  The 2013 Cairdeas Port didn’t suffer from these issues, neither did batch 1 of this Brodir from what I’ve heard.  Unfortunately, batch 1 bottles are even harder to find than the Cairdeas version.

The finish continues the theme of restraint.  Lower smoke levels than you’ll be accustomed to from The Frog, but it is really fruity with a medium length, lingering sweet finale.

Overall, I was hoping for the best and wishing it was a suitable replacement for the 2013 Cairdeas, but it comes up short- especially at the price point of $107 a bottle.  If you’ve had the good fortune to try the 2013 Cairdeas, and marveled at its brilliance, then you’ll see that this one is more of a tease than the real deal.  It’s still highly drinkable, but I’m still looking for that elusive Cairdeas.  3.75-4 stars for the Brodir.  Cheers."

3.5,Ah Laphroaig...even your not so great is good. Good official review on this. I have a problem whereby I can taste flavours but can't put my finger on what they are until I read flavour descriptors. Strawberry...of course now I read it it hits me. Lovely balanced drop. So light and smooth and smokey... with the trademark iodine bringing up the rear. Initially after the Millstone rye this was so faint but unlike some drams which hit you with flavour and drop off this goes the other way....slight on the initial hit then builds and builds to a lovely afterglow. Now the downside of reading other reviews for flavour guides is..well you get other things which come along for the ride and get implanted in your head. Yes that strawberry is getting quite sickly... would i have noticed without pre-reading....maybe...ok definitely it's way to sickly. Hmm $130...whaat! Do I go with first or last impressions? Ok 3.5.
