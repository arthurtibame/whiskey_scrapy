4.0,"I've been looking forward to reviewing this year's Laphroaig Cairdeas ever since it was announced.  I've been a bit of a harsh critic of several of Laphroaig's Feis Ile festival releases as of late, but this one had me licking my chops considering I absolutely love their core, NAS Quarter Cask offering.

Here's a bit of info on this year's special, festival release:  it's obviously bottled at cask strength 57.2% (versus the normal 48%), it's still non-chill filtered with no additional color added and it's made primarily, if not exclusively, from 5 year Laphroaig stock.  I couldn't find any info on whether there's some older malt used, but this seems on par with the regular Quarter Cask.  I also sampled this beside said QC juice and it's significantly lighter in color and produces less pronounced legs when swirled in a Glencairn tasting glass.  (""Legs"" are usually an indicator of the separation of water and alcohol in a whisky and the fact there are less here would be expected since this Cairdeas is cask strength- AKA no water added to dilute the ABV).  The lighter color probably means it spent less time in the QC casks to make it available in time for the 2017 festival.

The nose contained quite a bit of hickory smoke and freshly churned butter.  I was surprised how sweet this one smelled as opposed to the normal QC.  The higher ABV also hid the usual smoky character behind a wall of harsh, unyielding sweetness and heat.  Even after 20-25min it remained hot, oaky and dry.  I actually gave this one a few vigorous shakes in an effort to infuse air into and break down this semi, one dimensional wall, but it still held on and left me perplexed.

The palate really screams burnt embers.  It attacks your tongue and even when you try to manage a controlled exhale to take the burn away, you can't.  The smoke is hidden until the very end of the sip and plays second fiddle to the ABV's presence.

On the lengthy finish you finally get that Laphroaig smoke.  The oak spice settles in as well and there's a long salty, dry ending that affects the total experience in a way that I'm not really familiar with when it comes to Laphroaig.  The oily mouthfeel is nowhere to be found.  I'm kind of shocked that an increase of just 9% in ABV has this much affect on the usual Quarter Cask malt.

Overall, I'm confused.  I don't hate this stuff, but I don't love it either.  It's not a typical Laphroaig, which some folks will say is the purpose of the festival releases.  I get that, sometimes, and can really appreciate that.  It's very interesting because it's so different IMO.  I hope that letting some air into this bottle will allow for some subtle changes over time and maybe when I come back around it'll surprise me again.  As it is, it's still a solid whisky, I guess I just expected a more perfect QC and instead I got a new take on that exceptional malt.  4-4.25 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,"Whisky festival pro tip: There's often a special bottle or two lurking among the core lineups that the distillery representatives are offering at their tables. Often it's something stashed under the table that can be coaxed out after you've paid lip service to the core range and wondered out loud how it compares to that new limited edition you've read about. Sometimes it can be hiding in plain sight, inside the tube of a regular bottling.  But if you're at the Laphroaig table, check the Wellington boots. That's where, amid a peat field diaorama, I recognized the red loop of the 2016 Cairdeas just about visible inside one green wellie. And was that a golden hoop I spied in the second wellie? Could it be the new Cairdeas, I asked the kilted fellow filling glasses at the Astor Center Whisky Spectacular, who turned to be none other than brand ambassador Simon Brooking? Indeed it was, he said, fresh from the Islay festival. And what a lovely treat it turned out to be. I've posted two dismissive notes here about the Quarter Cask in as many days, but this cask strength version is a different beast. It's sweet and oily, and the drying tannins of the core version are mostly obscured by the rich honey flavors that linger. It's hard to make nuanced judgements in such circumstances, but this is unmistakably a good Laphroaig and worth checking out when it hits the stores in August."

4.5,"Opens up and the power of the cask strength dies down a lot after this bottle has been opened and sits on the shelf for a few months.  The result is a better, much creamier and sweeter whiskey compared to when first opened.  The intense smoke and peat remain as well.  4.5"

4.0,"The tide is high, but I'm holdin' on... Man, LeeEvolved was right with the surprising sweet notes on this cask strength (lovely) quarter cask. I have to say though, I am in love with this glencairn. Tropical fruits and a huge ton of mint! Just use a couple drops of water on this guy. Respect that strength! That lovely briny smokiness that brings a vision of a campfire on a beach. The palate, to me, is that extremely familiar quarter cask flavor I just can't get enough of from Laphroaig. The finish is a medium to long scorched earthy ash mixed with some lingering oranges and dried apricots. I appreciate the oakiness, and thankfully, it's not overwhelming here. This kind of dram is right up my alley! It's a 4.5!"

4.0,"The very first Laphroaig I didn't like was the QC.  So, going in, I expected not to like this, and be smacked with a 2x4 oak on the palette.  Instead I got a sweetness combined with the classic peat smoke.  The sweetness is there, but not overpowering, just enough to counterbalance the oak and peat.  I held off buying this year's Cairdeas, I just don't have any masochistic fantasies of being hit with a smoky oak tree.  I stand corrected...will be buying a bottle soon enough.  Thanks to my friend Lee for this sample, which he graciously gave as a bonus to the round 4 trading team offering."

4.0,Lots of peat on the nose but the peat is much more balanced by the sweet malt on the palate. Sweet peat. Then somewhere in between on the long finish.

4.0,"This review of the 2017 Cairdeas comes via a sample from @LeeEvolved and is my first review of 2018. For this years release Laphroaig chose a cask strength version of their ever popular Quarter Cask. Bottled at 57.2% ABV, and without a doubt it is non chill filtered and natural color. This is a brilliant golden straw. 

The nose has all of the typical Laphroaig goodness. Medicinal notes of iodine, and bandaids, just more in your face. Tar, asphalt, cold ashes, soot and smoke from a bonfire that was doused with seawater. Brine, seaweed and salty sea air. It’s sweet and fruity as well. Vanilla, dried apricots, almonds and marzipan. Oak sanded smooth and sawdust. Vanilla buttercream and custard. Caramel apples with a little menthol. After some extended time some light sherry notes appear. Some water reveals a citrusy note and brings out more oak and some ginger. 

A hot arrival on the palate. Oaky at first, but the peat quickly takes over in the form of smoke and ashes. There is a general fruity sweetness but at cask strength I’m having a hard time discerning what those fruits are. The oak comes back in a big way, like chewing on a bourbon and scotch soaked wood chip. Vanilla and some toffee. Pepper and lots of spice. Water brings out more vanilla and custard, but does little else unless you add so much water that it dulls the palate into submission. 

A full bodied mouthfeel, very oily and mouthwatering. 
The finish is long, spicy, oaky, medicinal and dry. 

I’m sort of torn on this one. It’s Laphroaig, my first love affair with scotch, and the QC popped my Islay cherry, but this is just too powerful for me to enjoy straight out of the bottle. 48% seems to be the right strength for this whisky and adding 9+% didn’t really do much for it. Water helped, but I really hate the NEED for water when enjoying a dram. Still, it’s Laphroaig, and I can’t hate on them. A strong 4. Thanks again for the generous sample lee. 
Cheers"

5.0,"The nose is fairly typical of Laphroaig, peat, honey, pear, and medicinal notes with just a touch of dark chocolate. The palate has the meaty and smoky flavors, but they are not overpowering and much smoother than the 10. There is some saltiness and a light burn. The finish is the big winner. The meatiness and smokiness blend so well and last so very long, you wish the whole drink was like this."

4.0,"Light colored—almost like vegetable oil. Medium bodied with an oily mouthfeel.

Nose: smoked BBQ briquette with a hint of molasses sweetness. Salted pork. Sweet peat and seaweed. Powerful camp smoke and charcoals. Faint lemon at the end.

Palate: honey and some citrus sweetness quickly overtaken by rich smoked brisket and bbq. Dense Smoke rises through the middle and the sweet peatiness and seaweed join in too. Sea salt also appears in droves. The finish is intense, smoky, and unrelenting. It just keeps going with billows of smoke and it leaves the taste of smoked brisket, sea salt, and a hint of charcoal on the palate.

This isn’t for the faint of heart or the peat haters. That could be said of ANY Laphroaig, but this one especially. This is an intense Islay whisky expression and a must try for anyone who loves these peated whiskies!"
5.0,"Color: Light

Nose: Smoked BBQ brisket, sweet peat, sea weed, faint lemon  at the end. 

Palate: Medium bodied with and oily mouthfeel. Honey and peat at the front joined by smoked brisket and more peat in middle. 

Finish is strong and leaves behind a lingering meaty smokiness."

5.0,"It's 57%, but doesn’t taste like it at all. I put a single drop of water in it to open up the flavor. It is more peaty than smoky, with both peat and sweet on the nose. The taste is long and smooth and both peat and spice hang on the back of your tongue long after you’ve swallowed. Loved it. I would gladly buy a bottle."

4.25,"It was the let down of the night (11 whiskies total). Not the worst of them but the expectations were very high for this one.

=> Tasting it again today, I completely changed my mind about it, maybe because my palate was worn the other day after tasting other 10 whiskyes (this one was the last), maybe because it opened a little bit or just maybe because today I'm alone and not influencied by my friends' opinions.

On the nose I can smell smoked pork with some sweet vanilla background. It kind of reminds me of Rauchbier (that I simply adore) and it is a subtle but lovely nose! :)
No sign of alcohol here in spite of the 57,2 abv.
On the palate the peat hits hard along with some serious barrel spices, but as a lover of Talisker, I dig some spice! ;) 
Some citrus sweetness on the background.
The finish is spicy and linger for some time...

Yeah, I like it!

Still don't think it deserves the 94 and whisky of the year that it got from the APP but also not by any chance a let down.

A solid 90 points for me and changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars.

Cheers!"

5.0,Much stronger and less sweet than the normal quarter Cask. Did a side by side tonight. Both were great but the other was probably slightly more drinkable on a regular basis. Sometimes I want to be smacked and I used to go to ugea or corry for that but this will work too. Looking forward to experimenting with water or ice on this but just had it neat this tonight

The arrival is sweet with vanilla and caramelized bacon. The finish is long and peppery with peat, some salty black licorice and sea salt. Another great Laphroaig! Cheers"

5.0,"Earlier this year, I worked my way through a bottle of the standard Quarter Cask. Looking back, that was a superb bottle in its own right. Enter the 2017 Cairdeas edition. I'm a sucker for cask strength whisky, so when @PBMichiganWolverine told me about this one, I was immediately intrigued at the opportunity to try what I am expecting to be the QC on steroids. Let's get into it.

Nose: It's undoubtedly recognizable as a part of the QC line. Heavy campfire smoke, iodine, salt, seaweed, ash, sulfur, and damp wood. A true maritime behemoth. It's a direct reflection of what I put in my QC review. True to form, I get vanilla, malt, orange, pepper, coconut, and almond. Big chestnut note. Following all that, an intense burst of cinnamon heat overtakes my senses. This one noses like a true cask strength Islay. In essence, it's the standard QC kicked up a notch or two, as you'd expect. Awesome.

Palate: This one starts off as a medicinal, maritime peat bomb. More smoke and iodine, coupled with seaweed and salt. It's simultaneously leafy and herbal, with spearmint and fresh spinach present. Plus black pepper and chili. As the palate progresses, it suddenly becomes much sweeter. Honey, vanilla, toffee, apple, and white chocolate. On the tail end, it's darker sweet notes of dark chocolate and cocoa. If I don't cut this off now, this will never end. There's a hell of a lot going on here, and it's all hitting the right notes.

Finish: Through and through, this one's a beast. This one goes on for days. Shortly after pouring, the finish is all campfire smoke and sulfur. hen it's back to spice. Chili, red pepper, black pepper, and cinnamon. Massive ABV in the best way possible. Beyond 30 minutes the peat and smoke are replaced by sweeter notes. Some of the chocolate, vanilla, honey sweetness carry over from the palate. The spicy notes still take over from here on out. The way this one evolves over time is astounding. Great stuff.

I compared this one to the standard QC several times for obvious reasons. This is one of those times when a great whisky is able to reach new heights when bottled at cask strength. In fact, I'd say this one is the epitome of such a phenomenon.

Gritty Islay? Check. Cask strength? Check. Remarkable complexity? Check. Reasonably priced? Check, again. I nabbed the last bottle on the shelf, and I'm lucky to have done so. It's since been replaced with the 2018 Fino Cask, which I can't wait to try. I came in a subscriber to Laphroaig, and now walk away a subscriber to the vaunted Cairdeas line. Thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for making me aware of this one. Absolute must buy if you can still find it. Simply amazing."

3.5,"I've had this bottle open for 4 months, and finally decided to finish it and write the review.  It's not that I dislike it and don't want to tarnish my oft-stated love of Laphroaig.  It's not that I love it and was waiting until I'd built a vocabulary adequate for expressing such greatness.  In truth, it's because I didn't really know what to think of it, nor how to express what I was tasting.  The nose is so hot that I get alcohol and smoke, and nothing else.  No amount of time changes this, and it doesn't evolve for me in any direction.   The palate also opens hot, but the gritty dryness goes really well with the overwhelming peat smoke, as if you're literally chewing charcoal (or eating the incredibly over burned skin of a natural-casing hotdog that you left in the fire for way too long).  it's enjoyable to me, but it's also very one-note, which is very un-Laphroaig.  After many small sips, and much concentration, I can get bits of iodine and seaweed, and the slightest hint of brine, before it closes out with more heat, grit and smoke.  Water makes it slightly less aggressive, but doesn't really change the nose or palate.  I don't hate on the NAS market because if a whisky tastes good, it doesn't matter how old it is.  That being said, this isn't as good as it could (should?) be, and would have been better served with a few more years in the barrel.  I'll take the standard 10 CS over this any day."
4.0,"This is a better one than the 2018, but still falls to the Lore or even the 10. What is very interesting about this one is a coconut note that you get and it has a nice body to the palate. Smoky and briny that we know and love from Laphroaig, and very happy I have it on the shelf. You won’t be disappointed with the purchase and if you’re a fan of Islay, this is a great one to have in the collection. Love that tropical twist on the peat monster Laphroaig. However, I love the band aid taste of the 10 which this lacks, although this one is just on another side of the Laphroaig spectrum."
4.5,"Start playing the bag pipes, i am reviewing this beauty.

Every year, Laphroaig releases a special "" Cairdeas"" expression, and lucky me got to try the 2017, cask strength expression. 

On saturday i traveled to New Jersey to certify myself as a whisky ambassador and to certify myself in an advanced Whisky production course.  My teacher after exam told me i was a good student (OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE SUBJECT IS WHISKY) And took out one of his private bottles; this Laphroaig Cairdeas 2017, which i believe he got as a present. 

Bottled at 57.2%abv, this one has a yellowish gold color, not dark but not common in whiskies. 

On the nose it was good but not perfect, laphroaig typical Peat, Toffee, Pepper, fresh can of tennis balls (a laphroaig trademark) and Bonfire. 23/25.

On the palate it was simply outstanding. Such a jewel. Vanilla, Toffee with a pleasant and balanced Pepper bomb, hot Sand and vanilla Cupcake. It might be a little straightforward but delicious. Perfect score here.

The aftertaste was quite the experience, sand, toffee, pepper, peat (that medicinal / artificial peat from laphroaig) and bonfire. Maybe even gun powder. Amazing.

Overall this very well balanced dram, delicious, sweet, peppery, spicy and peaty, is something you just need to try. 95/100 and i truly recommend this one. Slainte Mhath!!!"

4.5,Damn I like this one.  Smoke honey and vanilla on the nose.  Enters with a punch of Bbq and ash.  Fades into a gentle honey sweetness with a kick of white pepper at the end. Long finish with a tobacco ash ending.
4.0,Solid expression for the buck. A lot more fruit than normal Laphroaig. But enough sweetness and smoke to make you know whose behind it. One of my favorite years for Cardeas so far.
