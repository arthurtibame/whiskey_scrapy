3.5,"Summerton Virtual Whisky Festival sample.

This is a more interesting dram than many of the Mackmyra range.  First off, there’s notes of cherry Bakewell tart and a strange pear sweetness.  It reminds me more of a cherry brandy than a whisky.  It has a finish of spice and dried fruit that lingers for ages.

All in, a very nice dram, I’m just not sure it’s a whisky."
