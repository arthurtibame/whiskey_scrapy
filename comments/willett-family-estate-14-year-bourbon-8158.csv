4.25,"The color is a dark amber and leaves a thin coat of oil around the glass as it moves around. Despite its proof the nose is gentle and starts with soft oak, baking spices and cocoa, as creamier notes of vanilla and brown sugar begin to open up. Faint hints of cherry and toffee come and round out the nose. The palate is somewhat dry and also chewy, with creamy vanilla filling the mouth alongside a spicy serving of baking spices. Oak and cherry come together next to toffee to come up behind to make a perfectly balanced experienced, even if it seems a little heavy on spice. The finish is medium with lingering baking spice that fills the mouth while oakiness hangs on as well while the rest of the palate fades all too quickly. Beautiful whiskey but held back by too short of a finish."
