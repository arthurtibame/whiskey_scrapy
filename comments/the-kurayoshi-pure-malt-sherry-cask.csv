4.25,"To this day, this one can be consider a rarity. I have only seen this Kurayoshi at israel airport. Although it is matured at the Matsui distillery, this is actually scotch. The new make is made in scotland and most of the casks are also scotish but stored on the japanese distillery. It is strange but its true.

Bottled at 43% abv, amber color.

On the nose it is AMAZING. perfect score. Due to its maturation on sherry casks, its aroma is wonderful. Red fruits, Berries, Purple fruits: Raisins. Vanilla, White wine, Dr. Pepper cola, Maple syrup and strawberry marmalade. 

On the palate it is more straightfoward but still very nice. Grapes, sherry, tobbacco and chocolate.

Aftertaste is super candied and sweet. Its like hard bubble gum,  cinnamon, peanuts, molasses,  and a little bitter. 

Overall, this is a fine dram,  very enjoyable. 86 over 100."

Aftertaste is where it falls apart for me. A corny, malty, creamy note, that reminds me of grain whiskies. 

Overall, this is a fine dram but the aftertaste could be a lot better. Still an 83 over 100."
1.25,Me no likey much
4.5,A sherry-aged treat that’s not overly grapey-sweet. It’s complex and full with an herbal dried fruit flavor that’s rich and lightly spicy. The sweetness comes through after the oaky first notes and lingers with a briny tart finish that invites you back.
