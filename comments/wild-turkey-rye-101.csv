5.0,"It is highly recommended if you can get it opposed to the 81. Regardless we are talking about what Wild Turkey does best, spice and everything nice. This is an everyday rye not overly complex but thats not a complaint. The smooth spice notes on the nose are the same as those found on the palate. Its a great mixer but good enough to enjoy straight."
2.0,Surprisingly sippable for a 101 proof whiskey.

4.0,"Good rye,  especially for the price.  Better than Rittenhouse in my opinion,  but not very different. A bit thin in the mouthfeel compared with baby Saz,  but a good starter rye.  Hard to find these days  (early July 2015) but worth a try"

4.0,A good solid rye at 101 proof. A fine replacement when I can't find Rittenhouse. Try mixing with 1/2 Old Weller 107 for a full and rich Manhattan. What a great value at $27 for 1L!

4.0,"Definitely better than their other rye. The higher proof helps a lot, but the fruity aftertaste is a bit strange compared to the notes of something like bulleit rye. I haven't figured out if it's something that will grow on me yet. Luckily it was pretty cheap for what you get so I have plenty of sipping to go."

4.0,"Nose - Sweet cherry/strawberry/mint infused water, hint of oversteeped black tea that has a cinnamon stick in it.
Taste - Very floral and fruity vanilla, strawberry infused sweet tea, sweet mint, faint hint of cinnamon spice.
Finish - Tiny bit of sweet bitter like if you took steeped tea leaves & sucked on them, lingering sweet mint and strawberry sweetness, faint lingering cinnamon heat.
Score - 89/100"

3.0,"Wild Turkey 101 is one of my favorite inexpensive bourbons, and, to be honest, I didn't even realize that they made a rye version until I ordered this whiskey at a bar thinking that it was the bourbon.  What did I get out of this mistake?  A pretty decent, but very mellow, bourbon-like rye!  This is something of a chameleon, actually, with a nose that reads more like a spicy scotch than a rye whiskey.  There's much more honey and faint fruit than the strange, hoppy scents I associate with most ryes.  On the palate, however, it stays truer to its genre, plenty of spice (cinnamon, clove) without many distinguishing notes.  This also drinks under-proof.  At $40, it's a worthwhile alternative to Bulleit rye.  Around a 3.5, its current user score, is a very fair rating."

4.0,"Drinks like lower proof. Great nose of vanilla. Easy to drink neat. Simple rye. Not the best rye out there, but solid for a Thursday night. I’ll need to do a blind tasting with Rittenhouse Rye which is my current go-to."

4.5,"4.5/5

Easy rye, smooth and yet plenty of that mint/clean flavor ryes are known for. Still reminiscent of bourbon, though, with a lovely barrel/caramel taste."

4.25,"Wonderfully Woody, sweet, spicy, rich and incredibly smooth. Always keep several bottles on hand to insure I do not run out. This is one of my top 2 ryes as my daily drinkers...Then again I’m a BIG WT fan boy. Perfect to sip neat (my favorite way), or one large ice cube."

4.5,"Medium strength rye that is actually bottled and distilled at the same place.  This is unmistakably Wild Turkey.
Nose: Fruity -> cherry, Earthy -> yeast, sour dough, fresh dirt, grain, dill, Sweet -> honey, caramel, bubble gum flavor.
Taste: Cherry, sour dough, bread, yeasty, Spices, pepper,
Finish: Long and dry, with green apple notes"

3.5,"I’ve had Wild Turkey’s lower proof rye, but just not getting to try this one. Had this in a flight of other whiskeys. It was the first of the flight.

On the nose, right off the bat there is rye, sweet vanilla and a little bit of oak. It’s not quite as dusty as the lower proof rye.

The palate follows the nose. It is on the sweet side. There is also a light leather and cola notes in there as some anise.

The finish is medium length with lingering rye and a little bit of vanilla. Not much of a burn for me.

I though this was fine for a rye. Not a huge rye fan, but I enjoy them occasionally. I think this is a definite step up from the regular WT Rye. This one has bolder flavors, and also doesn’t taste like it’s been watered down, like the other one does for me."

4.5,"I stumbled onto this gem while out of town. Wild Turkey's own distilled 101 Straight Rye. I have never tried the 81, but let me just say this 101 is fantastic! It is great to sip neat and Very Flavorful. I added a bit of water a couple times to try it, and the water softens the heat just a tad, and smooths it out some, and it is enjoyable this way as well. Pepper, charcoal, good bit of oak, and rye, some tartness, and a little bitter all wrapped up in a good amount of sweetness (but not too much), make a perfect combination. Wild Turkey knocked it out of the park with this one. I really enjoy this and always pick up a bottle or two when I go out of town now. This is one of my favorite Ryes. 

1 Liter for $39 = Good value."

2.75,"As a fan of Wild Turkey products and the fact this product is not easy to come by, I think I set my expectations too high for this one because, overall, I was not too impressed. As a regular Rye whiskey drinker, I've experienced many brands. They all had something unique about them (even the sourced ones); however, this WT101 for some reason just didn't seem to have anything in particular to set itself apart; lacking in certain ways. Don't get me wrong, though. It is very drinkable and enjoyable. How can I put this? It's good...just not great. I did have a 1 liter bottle and finished it in a week, and I have no regrets."
3.25,"Nice for the price point!  Pick up spice, not to hot but a nice warmer!  Tried neat and in my first Manhattan as well (well aside from a few sips of others).  A friend recommended blending with AE, will be trying that as well.  Did not disappoint!"

3.75,"Nose: sweet tobacco, pine, mint, vanilla, chocolate 
Taste: nutty, pine, medicinal cherry
Finish: waxy, spearmint 
After reading reviews: reviews corroborate the strong mint note I got throughout, my nutty and waxy could be what reviews had as oak and oily, vanilla was pretty consistently noted in reviews.  I didn’t get the tart apple that Distiller noted on the taste - when I thought about fruitiness it was more like cherry cough syrup where it’s not quite sweet enough to mask the medicinal taste.  I think spicy is a vague note, but I got elements of that throughout with the pine/mint that registered with me more than cinnamon."

3.25,"Some turpentine and WT gunk on the nose. This seems to be a fruity rye, with some brown sugar notes. Very drinkable. Not the most complex, but there are some layers. This is a solid daily sipper. 6/21/19"
