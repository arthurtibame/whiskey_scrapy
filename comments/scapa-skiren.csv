3.0,"Scotland, September 2017 (from notes)

Nose: Sweet with thin honey and light malty cereal aromas almost like buttered popcorn. Fruity notes are evident, mainly orchard fruits (apples, pears, peaches), plus a filament of vanilla sewing it all together. Not a particularly complex nose, and quite light, but enjoyable. [The dry glass has an aroma of honey, almost like mead].

Palate: Silky soft and smooth on the arrival – so smooth – light and airy like a lemon soufflé. A light and not particularly rich texture. More honey, and slightly heavier fruity notes than the nose. Apples, pears, apricots. A tiny hint of salt.

Finish: Short, but not abrupt, the light sweetness that has been prominent throughout carries on until the end.

It has a dainty character and does not come across as cloying, and has the sweetness of light fruit juice, not syrup. It's somewhat reminiscent of a very light Old Pulteney 12, but with less of everything. This would be an agreeable, light, everyday dram if it were more reasonably priced, but as it is it's not particularly good value.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

3.0,"Still working through my notes from last month's trip to Scotland; I tried this dram at Whiski Rooms in Edinburgh.  For a long time, the only distillery of note on the isle of Orkney was the legendary Highland Park.  Scapa is now giving it a go, making whisky on one of the most remote and northern islands in Scotland.  Unlike Highland Park, Scapa doesn't seem to peat their whisky at all, which results in a slightly more traditional Highland style of single malt.  There's plenty of honey and orchard fruit here, along with an underlying nuttiness that gives this a thicker mouthfeel than I'd expect for a 40% whisky.  It's OK, nothing to write home about (although I suppose that's exactly what I'm doing)."

3.0,"The nose brings red delicious apples, pears,  and light floral properties. Very crisp and bright.  Thin mouth coat and the palate brought vanilla, custard, more apples, butter, and the finish was short and dry.  Thankfully, there aren’t any off putting notes, but there’s nothing much to set it apart from basic highland or speyside 10 year olds as well.  The theme to this dram will be something equally simple, but pleasant. In honor of hoping the Red Sox win this year, let's make it ""Sweet Caroline"" by Neil Diamond. 3.0. Thanks for the sample @Scott_E !"

3.0,"This sample is from the other distillery on the island of Orkney:  Scapa.  These guys are less than a half mile from the superstars named Highland Park, but their whisky is miles apart.  Scapa uses water for their malts that is piped in and doesn’t flow through the natural peat beds covering the island.  Therefore, they aren’t a peated whisky.  Scapa’s offerings are closer to Speyside and Lowland style malts and are more honeyed.

This distillery was founded in 1885 and is currently owned by Pernod Ricard.  They make around a million liters per year and currently only offer a 14, 16 and 25 year old, official distillery bottle.  The rest is NAS, like the Skiren, or shipped off for use in blends.

This NAS Skiren is 40% ABV and is light gold with oily and watery legs running down the taster.  I’m pretty sure it is chill filtered and has added color, but I don’t have the bottle in front of me, as this sample was provided by my friend @Scott_E, from Long Island, NY.

The nose is a wonderful fruit basket of flavors:  apples, pears and melons along with some nice vanilla sweetness.  There are ripe berries in here as well.  I do get a nice backbone of ex-bourbon wood, too.  It has an excellent nose, for sure.

The palate has similar fruit notes from the nosing, but there’s serious mouthfeel issues here:  it’s harsh and dry and doesn’t coat anything.  My opinion is that it’s just too light.  It needs a bit more well-aged juice in the mix along with a hearty bump in ABV.  But then again, they probably aren’t going for that here so it’s just wishful thinking on my part.

The finish is medium with a dry and salty, island-style feel.  The fruits still linger a bit, but the dryness is just too powerful to make it very satisfying.

Overall, this is a serviceable dram but the fact the age statement bottles are so much more expensive than not only their Orkney counterparts, but most Speyside and Highland distilleries, it’s hard to justify spending the big bucks to find out if they’re worth it.  I like the fruity aspects, but I can find those elsewhere for a much better price.  Why gamble?

That said, this is a 2.75-3 star dram tops.  It’s cool to be able to try this distillery, but I doubt I’ll be back for something else unless a great deal happens to fall into my lap.  Cheers."

4.0,First blush it had a different taste than other Scapa scotches. I really couldn’t taste a lot of the nuances. Added water and it blossomed with vanilla and fruit

3.0,"Pleasant enough highland heather/honey without even a trace of smoke or peat; a little floral, vanilla, bourbon cask maturation shining through. Reminds me of McClelland’s highland, Auchentoshan Classic, and a little of Oban, but less complex and no smoke at all. WAY overpriced, but the state de-listed it so
I don’t feel ripped off at $40."
3.0,"Orkney's second distillery is often overlooked for a reason: its small range of NAS expressions is poorly presented and shockingly expensive! Matured in first fill American oak, the nose of Scapa Skiren is gentle, creamy and citrusy with notes of pine needles, barley sugar and heather honey. Did you ever taste the Christmas tree? Resin and wood bitter flavors attack the palate with a dry kick, disrupted by hints of sweetness and Ricola cough drops. More bitterness, lemongrass and Earl Grey tea dominate the rather short finish. Back to Highland Park...

3.5,"The only Scapa I had, and still have some left, is their 16 year aged expression. I found that quite good, but a tad overpriced.  From this small distillery, and small stocks, the need to go to NAS allowed them to expand their single malt offerings to Skiren and Glasna.  Not sure I agree, but who am I?

A color of new copper pennies and I would assume there is color added. 

A slightly unique nose that’s all fruit and honey.  Peaches is the primary fruit and took me some time to nail it down. Diced Granny Smith apples, dried pineapples, sugar glazing, bananas, strawberries.  Vanilla cream with some mild oak and maple syrup take time to come through after a good amount of time.  A good, sweet nose.  

The body is thin and brings with it a sugary, woody and spicy mixture.  Peaches, tangerine, apples, pineapple, bananas.  A fruit bowl realized.  An oaky spiciness slowly works it’s way in to the finish. 

An slight oaky palate remains with a bit of ginger and a twist of orange that is unfortunately somewhat short. 

Pleasantly surprised as this is an easy sipper that has a fruity sweetness that’s not overblown.  This would most definitely be improved by a bump in ABV as it would pack behind it a bit more oomph. A drop in price of about $15 would also be a big plus. All in all, quite a joy.  [84/100][Tasted: 1/27/19]"

2.0,"This one is courtesy of @Scott_E as part of our final sampling round.   I don’t know about this one...it has potential, but just too young and rough around the edges.  Nose Is slightly briny, slightly oaky, a bit of fruit.  But, non-assertive.  Palette is similar.  Fruity, salty...but, it quite doesnt’ assert itself like it’s other brethren Islanders.  If I compare to the other Islanders of equal price:  a Talisker 10 and HP 12 have more complexity, assertiveness, and flavor than this one.  A Jura has as well, but personally I always found Juras to be the schizophrenic dysfunctional child in that Island group.   I always imagined an Islander Christmas office party where  Talisker is the brand that’s making printouts of her arse in the copier machine while smoking under a “do not smoke” sign, while HP is the pretty one dressed up as a Viking,  Jura is the drunk crazy guy, Arran is trying to be like Talisker but gets chewed out by Human Resources instead, while Tobermory and Scapa are the two wall flowers.  Anyway...This is about $45 or so.  A Talisker 10 is about $50.  If you really want the salty-briny sea air taste of an Islander, this ain’t it...go for the Talisker 10 for a bit of pocket change more.   So... I ask the basic question again...why does this particular one exist?  Market forces should dictate it be wiped away since better Islanders are there for similar pricing.  What do I know...just my two cents."

4.0,"Stop number 99 on the SDT is Scapa. The “Other Orkney distillery”, as many call it, is the only other distillery to inhabit the Orkney Islands with its much more famous neighbor...Highland Park. They too embrace their Norse heritage. Skiren is a Nordic word meaning “glittering bright skies”. Bottled at 40% ABV and is chill filtered and has colorant added making it a golden amber. Skiren is matured exclusively in first fill American oak casks

The nose is intensely fruity. Tangerines, apples, pears, honeydew, strawberries and banana. Sweet vanilla cream, cinnamon and toffee. Perfumes with some light floral notes. Far off bourbon notes, rich oak, maple and coffee with a touch of brown sugar. The first fill bourbon casks really work wonders here. 

The palate is light a fruity. Tangerines, strawberries, pears, artificial watermelon flavor, pineapple, coconut, papaya and banana. Yes a fruit basket’s worth of flavor. The oak flavors come in after a while with caramel, syrupy sweetness, cinnamon and nutmeg. A delicious dram. 

A light bodied mouthfeel that is lightly oily and mouth coating. Still enough to carry all those fruity notes though. 
The finish is medium short unfortunately. I wish it would have lasted longer. It’s sweet and fruity. 

This was a complete surprise as I did not expect such a sweet and fruity whisky to come from Orkney. One to relax with and enjoy with friends. I would not call this a noob scotch as it’s got plenty of qualities the connoisseur would appreciate, but is friendly enough for the uninitiated in the ways of the water of life. Now, I think that being at 40% hurts this whisky, but not as much as others. Bumping the strength to 43% would probably do wonder, but I think making the jump to 46% might change the character too much and it would not be the same fruity wonder. It’s not exactly cheap for a NAS at $80 or so, but it is one that I would consider purchasing. A solid 4 and a thanks to @Scott_E for the sample. 
Cheers"

3.5,"I got to say i was eager to try a Scapa, but i never knew it was from Orkney. Island whiskies are always a good thing but this one in particular lacks a little emotion. 

Bottled at 40%abv deep copper color. 

On the nose peat but very dim, spices but very dim, orange candy, impalpable sugar (i dont know if this is its right name), salty and sweet. Nice aroma but not too strong.

On the palate, Chocolate, Tobbacco, Spicy, Too smooth like water, first 2 seconds is like nothing.

Cake choccolate dry, Similar but inferior to highland park. Bitter notes. Finish is way too short. 

Overall it could be better. 73 over 100."
