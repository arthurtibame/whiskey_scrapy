2.0,"Pleasant floral nose.  Light grassy malt flavors.  Subtle sweet fruits, and vanilla as usual.  However the finish is rather nasty.  Not really spicy or earthy...just rotten burn.  Doesn't shine like a 10 year old ought to.  I would avoid this one."
4.0,"Rich fruit notes with spices and a very subtle peat taming the sweetness. Transcendent when paired with orange dark chocolate. Also difficult as hell to find anywhere, which is probably why it's on the pricey side."
