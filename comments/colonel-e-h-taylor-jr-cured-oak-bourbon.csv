4.0,Wow!  At $40-$45; this may be one of my new favorites!  Such complex flavors on the tongue and such a smooth finish for a 100 proof.  You have to try this one...

4.0,"A solid choice for a higher proof/older age bourbon, but didn't knock my socks off with any great undertones.  Would suggest an ice cube or two to bring out some vanilla."
null,Literally my favorite bourbon of 2014.  If you have a chance to taste it anywhere - do it.  I was lucky enough to snag a bottle - I honestly can't say I've ever had such a strong note of strawberry and subtle spice to compliment the sweet nose.  Finishes as smooth as any of the 60 bottles in my pantry.  Instant favorite

5.0,"You immediately notice the color on this one. It is a very dark reddish-copper. Then the nose, which is just as great as the color. Tons of sweet oak (emphasis on the sweet), vanilla, and a little bit of fruitiness.
The taste is full of sweet and creamy vanilla. I get the slightest taste of fruitiness, similar to an orange peel.
Overall, this was very enjoyable. I am glad I was able to get one for now and one for later."

3.0,"Probably more deserving of 3.5 stars. Decent. Not great. Bought it a couple of years ago and left it sealed until recently. Halfway through the bottle, it just an average bourbon. Nothing more. I’ve had far worse, certainly. But I’ve had far better as well, many in this same price point if not cheaper. From the point, the only Col. I’ll ever probably revisit is Sanders."

4.75,"Light corn dust, floral, lemon oil, brown sugar on the nose. Slightly oily, fresh bread, light cherry to the taste"
4.75,Not doing this review in real time. Tasted at Westport Wine and Whiskey in Louisville. This is one of the best unfinished whiskeys I’ve ever tasted. Expensive pour but worth it.
5.0,Incredible. Buy this if you ever find it. Super rare.
4.25,"Amazing and unique taste. Price for the bottle is not worth, but definitely worth a pour if it’s reasonably priced."
