5.0,"My no. 100 Whisky review had to be special, and it definitively was. I was long saving this mini bottle (5cl) for this special landmark and as soon as i opened it i knew it was going to live to the expectation. I truly believe this reviews are not made of hype, and i try to be as objective as possible. I have to say this because it is very important for you to know that i do not write this because we are talking about a discontinued bottle or a very rare and old dram. I write this because it is the truth. Bottled in 1980, (Woohoo!) At 43%, with a beautiful old oak color. This Johnnie Walker Premier was made out of whiskies from distilleries that do not longer exists nowadays. I read somewhere that it was intended for the japanese market, making it more difficult to come around one. When i ordered the 5cl mini bottle 8 months ago, the big one (750ml) was about 250£, and it was still available in some websites. I checked it today and it is harder to find than 8 months ago, but it is still out there. Lets review this beauty: On the nose is wonderful. Maple honey, caramel, tobbacco, smoke, salt, prunes, some beach aroma and rain forest notes, wrapped in a very perfumed and elegant way. Very complex aroma, lovely to nose. It is so nice that i took a lot of time before tasting it, just enjoying the smell. On the palate is delicious and rewarding. One of my regular critics about expensive whiskies is that most of them are kind of boring, because the distillers try to hard to make something easy enjoyable in making the flavors less bold. Creme Bruleè, caramelized apple, elegant old wood, almonds are the main notes for the palate, to start a long pleasant aftertaste, which is complex with salt, spicyness (can'tdefine what is it but it is not pepper, maybe ginger), and ashes from a bonfire. Overall it felt like a mixture from every Johnnie Walker out there. Absolutely stunning. 100 out of 100: 25% nose, 25%taste, 25% finish and 25% balance. It is the best whisky i have had to this date. IMPRESSIVE. SLAINTE!"
3.5,"You get your Johnnie Walker notes of smoky and peaty notes throughout but what stands out in this one for me is you get those deep sherry notes very similar to Dalmore 12 on your nose.

On the palate though is your normal Johnnie Walker notes in the background while those deep sherry notes sort of wrap around with it."
