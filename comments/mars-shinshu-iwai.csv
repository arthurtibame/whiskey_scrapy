2.0,Meh...just okay....smells like rubbing alcohol at first though it tastes much better than the aroma....finishing is okay. Picked it up compulsively when grabbing a couple Islay scotches at Costco.

3.0,"It's interesting, sure.  It comes in quietly--not Balvenie quiet; I mean you can tell it's alcohol.  But it does have some sweet accents mid-dram and it ramps up on the back end with a big-ass hit of spice.  Think like guerrilla sriracha."

2.0,"I actually bought this on a whim---it was reasonably priced relative to other Japanese malts.  And then I realized why.  The nose starts off delicate and floral...almost teasing you that the experience will be like a Hibiki 12.   Then it falls apart on the palette.  It's simply too spicy and sharp on the tongue, indicative of its youth.  I think it greatly could've benefited from more time with the wood.  I guess everything related to Japanese malts is soaring high nowadays....and once in a while, it's good to have something like this to remind us that not every Japanese malt is made equal."

3.0,"Mars Shinshu Iwai is a good news, bad news whiskey.

The bad news? It’s first impression kind of sucks. This alone might turn people away without a second thought.

If you’re like me, the first and most dominant thing you’ll get from the nose is acetone. Don’t breathe too deeply unless you’re looking to clear out those sinuses in a severe and unpleasant way. If you’re willing to soldier on through, this is where the good news begins.

After a few drops, the acetone is minimal, allowing other aromas to shine through like toasted nuts, wood chips, molasses, caramel and a touch of citrus.

The mouth feel is a bit light, offering cherry, oak, cereal grains and a buttery element. The issue here is that these elements are better, more intense, and delightfully defined when no water is added. That however means suffering through the nose if you want a more interesting palate. Sadly, this requires you to make a decision on where to compromise, the nose or the flavor profile.

The finish is surprising. While the proof is relatively low, this one lingers, offering a bit more for you buck. It’s a nice way to close out the dram.

I wouldn’t call this one overly refined, but if you’re willing to put in the time, this is a really fun, smooth and enjoyable dram to try, at an incredibly stellar price point.

3.0,Not mind blowing but not underwhelming. If bought worth the price if under 40. It literally reminds me of a lower shelf version of Nikka Coffey Grain with more Scotch than American Whiskey notes. Would buy to have as an affordable and mixable whisky. Need to try the Tradition next.
