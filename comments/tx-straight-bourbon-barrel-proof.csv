4.25,"Aroma is sweet, caramel with woody oak. Smells like the regular TX , taste is somewhat similar but on steroids. Has the sweet vanilla hits, caramel but with a barrel proof of 127.4 it gets your attention very quick. But it’s still very very drinkable. Faired better with a bourbon cube added to it. I do like it much better than their first run TX Bourbon I had a few years ago. Well done."
