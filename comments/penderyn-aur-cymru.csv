2.75,"Nose (w/o water): Initial smell of tropical notes, green apples backed with a warm cinnamon tone

Taste (w/o water): oak, slight spice, fresh and clean finish. At 46%, doesn’t taste full bodied. Probably better to dilute with water. None the less a great beginner whiskey I say."
3.5,Relatively smooth and a bit sweet. A pleasant burn at the end.

3.5,"Definitely a bit sweet with a sharp spirit edge - gingerbread flavor, maybe some orange peel, and definitely a nice smooth burn at the end. Pretty simple and straightforward, not especially complex, but this would be nice with Christmas dinner."
