4.0,The new Old Pulteneys are great. I may have preferred the 18 to the 25. Tasted at The Whisky Show London.

4.0,"Quite different to the 15 year, as the flavors don’t really emerge until mid-palate. The finish is long and heavy on the wood spices. Tasty, but I preferred the 15. Likely to cost about $150 when it hits U.S. shelves, which is close to the price of the much better but discontinued 21."

4.0,"Old Pulteney tasting event, Sydney, February 26, 2020, Whisky #4

Nose: Rich, dusky floral (hibiscus and old rose), dark fruits (dried dates), chocolate muffins, orange syrup, fresh oily cigar, cinnamon and oak. There is a faint suggestion of ash or charcoal in the distance.

Palate: Rich, sweet chocolate and blood orange marmalade arrival with a briny foundation. Herbal, spicy development with apricots, nectarines and hazelnut. The texture is creamy and full.

Finish: Long. Praline, nougat and orange chocolate with a dash of salty caramel sauce. Beautiful finish.

There is a similarity to some facets of the 15 year old expression here but this is far less dry and has a creamy rich quality. Not that the signature Old Pulteney briny dryness is lacking, but this expression has found a supurb balance. Adding water enlarges the dram but it is not necessary.

It spends 16 years in ex-bourbon and receives 2 years of ex-sherry finishing, which seems to be an excellent combination, but I can’t help wonder what a few casks of PX-matured spirit in the vatting would do.

This was also the first dram that I felt approached anything like the stature of the old 17 and 21 year expressions, although they are still much the superior drams.

At the moment there is no allocation of this whisky to Australia but when it does come (and it will) the price will be around $250-300, which was that of the old 21 year at the time it was withdrawn. Unfortunately as much as I enjoyed this whisky I will not be paying that sort of money for a bottle.

“Very Good” : 4 stars"
