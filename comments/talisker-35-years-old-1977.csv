4.75,"Nose: Magnificent - it is like you got teleported to the shore of Talisker distillery with a single sniff. Oyster shell and the creaminess of oyster, sea water, hint of peat and smoke,scent of grass and almond. You are basically facing the sea from the distillery. With water the more fruity characters like tangerine and grapefruit become more visible.

Palate: I like the nose more but it is still great. Some licorice comes in, continues to be peaty and salty. Some lemon peels and grapefruit as well.

Finish: Some woody notes come out but it is more of smoke and peat. 

Definitely a very high quality Talisker despite the relatively high cost, a great presentation of the best characteristics from the distillery."
5.0,"100 points... every time. That is Talisker for me. 

One of my last reviews on ""impressive whiskies i had in Scotland"", is this marvelous Talisker 35yo, from 1977 and bottled in 2012. This is a special release, that seems very hard to find and it has a 54.6%abv strength. 

Talisker is one of my favorite distilleries, and this expression is no exception to the rule. 

Well, lets get to business. 

On the nose: Beautiful talisker peat. Toffee, Oranges, Pepper, Sea; Typical talisker profile.
Peat with sugar went crazy bold here. Bonfire, Ashes; Nose went full maritime after first sip. 

On the palate, Very watery at the beggining
Then Boooooom peaty, peppeery, grassy peat. Oranges. Toffee. It is your typical talisker. Chocolate notes, Like snickers chocolate bar.

Aftertaste is also wonderful. Chocolate finish with peat. Lovely. Ashes like burning a chocolate house, lol. 

Overall this is one perfect dram. It tastes like any other Talisker but with more chocolate. Let it breath for a while, it has been on a cask for 35yo, it takes some time to develop fully. My score is 100 OVER 100. Sláinte Mhath!!!"
