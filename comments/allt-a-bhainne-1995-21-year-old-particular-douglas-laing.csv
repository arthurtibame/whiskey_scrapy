4.25,"The nose is gentle with oak, honey, soft nutmeg, buttercream and sponge cake. Smells like a bakery with alcohol. The palate starts off with honey, oak and baking spices, with toasted nuts, poached pears and fruitiness balancing everything out. The finish is long and coats the mouth with a nutmeg spiciness, along with barley, soft fruit, fresh biscuits and a hint of oak. Excellent."
