4.0,"[Whiskey Live New York 2016] - I'm being generous with my rating because I was only able to get a few sips out of this.  It's Tully alright, but a little more complex.  It's still not amazing, but I would like a bottle if I could find it."

Experience: need to sit with this more."

4.0,"Everything that I love about Tullamore. The bourbon, rum, and sherry casks give it a longer more complex finish that’s fruit-forward with plum and a little spice on the back end. Is it really worth a 4 rating? More like a 3.75, but if I’m going across the pond for my whisky, it is in my top 5 under $75.00 USD, so I will give it a 4."

4.0,"Blasphemy, a blend?!! Are these 4 stars really the same 4 that go to the best scotch single malt? I can see that if you've drunk some the cheaper Irish blends you might be a tad surprised but trust me. This is a great tipple late at night when you don't feel quite ready for a peaty Islay or Jura, but aren't quite ready for a Mcallan Fine Oak or Aberlour Abunadh. Amanda's description is spot-on, and if you like Special K Red-Berries, you'll taste a delicious hint of that cereal! (Do you ever secretly eat a bowl of Red Berries when your partner's fallen asleep watching a sic-fi flick?) Pleasant indeed - I would rate at 3.5 stars but it gets a generous half for its long, complex warming finish, standing up well to the Speysiders and as an aperitif before you start on the heavy beauties whether a  Macallan 18 or Glenfarclas 21. Recommended my hearties and please don't put me up in front of the judge! :-)"

4.0,"I definitely get the green tea, the fruit flavors are in the background, for me hard to separate probably because I am new at tasting good liquor and dividing the tastes I get individually, super smooth and delicious, definitely need to try it onc if you haven't. On the upper end of 4 stars."

4.5,"baking spices; cinnamon, nutmeg. can really taste the rum sweetness too. reminds me of a British baked treat"
3.75,Very nice drink. Sweet and vanilla to start. A bit oily on the tongue and a touch of spice in the finish. There are additional fruit notes as well. A very easy sipping whisky

3.75,OK Irish Whiskey but not buying again
4.0,"My favorite of Tullamore so far, although I have yet to open the 18. Even at 55% ABV it is smooth and has a low alcohol burn and wonderful complex woody flavors. No water or ice needed to make it drinkable. By far the most well rounded of their offerings."
5.0,"This is damn delicious. So smooth and so clean, clean. Definitely my new favorite high end Irish whiskey!"
3.0,"Amanda's final words in her excellent review say it best. Layered and tasty, but smooth and sippable. Fruit-forward, but without some of the notes that make that a turn-off for many including myself. The green tea and plum do not overreach, the tullamore body isnt lost, the cask finishes are all really pleasant to sip and let them lead your tongue around.

Neat it wasnt perfect. In my few tests about half a cube worth of water for a small tumbler worked best. A fat tumbler pour over 1.5 cubes with 1teaspoon licor 43 brought ALL the caskings out fabulously. I want to give it a 4, but 3.75 like someone else said is maybe the reach. 3.5 totally out of 5 I could see.

its unique, its tullamore, its Irish craft refined. Nothing to go stash a case of, but a bottle I definitely liked."
