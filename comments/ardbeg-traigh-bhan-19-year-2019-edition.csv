4.25,"Uncorked on New Years Eve 2019 as one of only two 19-year-old whiskies in my collection. 

It offers soft, rounded peat with some lightly fruited (pineapple) notes sitting on top of a heavy backdrop of salty sea air. 
The age is clear here and does a lot to mellow things out but also diminishes the peat smoke that makes Ardbeg great. A solid dram but one not worth the price of admission imo."
5.0,"Nose: Stone fruits, white pepper, brine.  There's a rich peat with beautiful threads of smoke.  Oak, vanilla, icing.  Oregano, basil.  Black and green olives.  Lemon oil, wintergreen.  Charred poblanos.  Bell peppers.  Complex and cohesive.  Unmistakably Ardbeg.

Palate: Vanilla, oak, ash, peat.  Icing - confectioner's sugar and cream.  Tannic, with mild bitterness.  Toasted oak.  Toasted cereal grains with honey.  Herbaceous and vegetal - tarry rope comes to mind.  This gets into both Laphroaig and Lagavulin territory for me - some campfire ash and char notes as well as deep, rich, meaty character.  The casks are on display, but in the best way possible.  Finish begins with a bright, ashy kick alongside plums, figs, and vanilla.  Slowly the fruit morphs into bananas, kiwis, and mangoes. Eventually everything settles into a honeyed toasted wheat bread, ash, brine, and light perfume.

Other notes: This is my second glass of this and I'm not mad.  This is Ardbeg at full tilt - the phenolic, complex, rich beast I've come to expect.  A beautiful glass and one I believe everybody should experience."
5.0,"Nose: Smoke, peat, earth, sherry, raisins.  Cocoa, leather, coffee.  Maduro tobacco.  Figs.  Cream cheese frosting.  Mint, wintergreen, lemon oil.  Dried thyme, basil.  Slightly vegetal - green bell pepper, cucumber, celery.  The sherry is contributing some beautiful sweetness - verging on cloying but not unappealingly so.

Palate: Soft and round - earthy, peaty, with whisps of smoke.  Peach, orange, mango, mint.  Brown sugar and vanilla.  Campfire ash.  Creamy.  Dates and figs.  Apricots.  Persimmons.  Wintergreen.  Lemon oil.  Honeysuckle.  Slight prickly alcohol, but not intrusive.  Finish starts off with more of that sherry sweetness.  There's a buildup into a splash of alcohol brightness.  And then the tannins from the barrel coat your tongue and mouth and longer, along with dark stone fruits.  Finish is long.  Beautiful."

4.25,"I re-signed my work contract for another 6 months tour of duty and so back down in my home town at my favourite whiskey bar where I spied this beauty and the Kilchoman STR on the shelf. $30 usd a pour better than spending $210 usd for a bottle. This is damn nice.. starts slow but then builds into a crescendo of awesome blended  flavor. Definitely a 4.25 maybe 4.5. Vanilla, salted caramel (probably the mix of chutney I was eating at the time), peaty smoke and more. It has kick, richness and power. It definitely beat the Kilchoman."

4.5,Such a beautiful Ardbeg - the smoke is everything you would want from this release. However its a bit priced over what I would be be going out and grabbing another bottle for.

4.0,"Bitter sweet finding this today.  Recently one of the best people in the Ohio/kentucky whisky world was let go from his job and frankly I'm a bit sour about it.  But hey with a release like this, they're going to sell out, best to get my bottle and pass on more available options down the road.  

So sour grapes aside, Traigh Bhan, my most anticipated dram of the year.  Lets dig in.

Nose - Ok full disclosure I've never had a whisky's description notes be so dead on for me.  First nose without any real time in the glass and I get a common theme of a candy cigar and light smoke.  Yeah I know, nothing special here.  It's however pretty smokey given the 19 years of age.  Once it opens just a hair there's  lemon lime with a heavy lime note.  This of course is an ardbeg classic note.  I then get perhaps a smoked pineapple.  

Taste - More of the lemon but some sour and bitter pineapple notes as well.  Spicy notes, there's a real hot spice note here that I don't get often in Ardbeg.  The smoke is a bit refined but it isn't lacking in some punch either.  Anyone worried that 19 years would let the smoke fade too much I think you'll be impressed.  This is really fruity, spicy, and I can see some touches of chocolate going on.  

My first impression was it was a bit thin but on second though maybe it's not.  I can't tell if there's some sherry casks in here or what ardbeg is doing.  I don't believe this is 100% bourbon maturation, but I can't place what the other barrels are.  The spice makes me think european oak but the chocolate note and some of the sweetness means it is almost assuredly oloroso (doubtful it is european oak in that case).  Water is actually bringing down the lime and giving me a bit more sherry notes.  

299.99 USD retail vs 169 pounds.  No wonder it sold out in the UK...they're screwing the rest of the world and no shocker american's are buying this stuff up from over there.  This is just beyond stupid pricing and it is hurting the home market despite on the surface looking to be a favor to them.  But pricing aside, should you buy it?

Yes.  

This is absolutely outstanding whisky.  Should you get a second?  That's where the price point has me passing.  I can't see getting a backup at 300 bucks.  300 is at the high HIGH end of my normal comfort zone and I have a feeling most don't want to spend that ever.  It's over priced, but it's just so dang good.  

4 stars, this is exceptional without reaching into the truly rare and special levels."
4.5,"Coming in 3rd in our tasting last night at @Richard-ModernDrinking’s, behind Michter’s 10yr 2019 rye and Octomore 10 Dialogos.  

As much as I absolutely refused to buy this and give in to the Ardbeg pricing machine, just out of personal philosophy, I admit...this is damn good.  Not to the level (or price ) of the older 22, but much better than its siblings.  As to be expected.  

Wet ropes, tar, OILY, real oily.  Day after a campfire by the beach.  Smoked fish over coals.  

Really well made.  Worth the $300USD?  That’s individualistic.  I’m still not going to buy, but I admit...it’s freakin good. 
Thanks @Richard-ModernDrinking for the pour and take home sample!"

4.5,"Nose: smoky wood dominant, some chocolate
Palate: sweet caramel, peaty and smoky as always, the label's tasting note shows ""chilli chocolate"" which I agree is a great descriptor. Strong flow back from throat after swallowing
Finish: Lingering on the chocolate sweetness"

5.0,"Very smooth, rich and complex. Well balanced in all areas of Ardbeg signature notes."
4.0,"Nose: Soft smoke, salt, cloves, nectarines, lemon. Refreshing! Invigorating!

Mouth: Dark mint chocolate with a dusting of chili, hint of pineapple, a juicy salmon off the barbecue; the smoke is very well balance and integrated. The flavors tilt more to the bourbon influence than the sherry - I’d guess the barrels are 80% the former.

Finish: Creamy, dark chocolate, plum, menthol smoke, ends dry and a touch tangy.

Elegant and sophisticated, this tastes like it was bottled on a cool summer evening rather than during a storm, as the bottle proclaims. It’s recognizably Ardbeg and yet distinct from the rest of the core range. While it faces the same problem as every Ardbeg release that has to justify its existence in the shadow of the 10 and Uigeadail, it’s a much stronger contender than An Oa, the last permanent addition to the range. I’m not sure I could recommend buying a whole bottle at this price, but it’s definitely worth sharing one with a friend. A great start to the new whisky season."
5.0,Time to find a bottle
4.5,"Nose- sweet chilis, peat smoke, pineapple, lemon oil, green apple, pine needles

Palate- Fire wood initially, peat smoke, rosemary, mango, citrus, sea salt 

Finish- Medium, creamy finish with notes of bonfire, bright citrus, and peat smoke 

Absolutely beautiful nose. In fact, the best nose I’ve experienced with an ardbeg. As a matter of fact... this is the best Ardbeg i’ve tried (although the 10 is pretty close to it, and about 7 times cheaper). Lovely pineapple and peat smoke, with a prominent green apple note developing as the glass sits awhile. The palate leads with, of course, peat. Lovely bonfire peat, followed by a wave of citrus and herbal notes. The finish is an enjoyable one. Not the longest in the world, but the peat does linger a while. Overall, it’s great. But due to value, I would take an Ardbeg 10 all day"

4.25,"Ardbeg and Macallan provoke a lot of intense fan devotion and, as a consequence, have some of the most extreme pricing in the single malt market.  The unfortunate reality is that those prices put their virtuoso expressions out of reach for the average consumer, including this humble whisky drinker.  Nonetheless, I was lucky enough to try this $300-400 bottle at a recent tasting that focused on sister brand Glenmorangie.

In contrast to its Islay neighbors, Laphroaig and Lagavulin, Ardbeg's malt seems characteristically ""heavy.""  It's dense and oily, an effect that doubles when aged in sherry casks that darkens and enrichens the fruit notes already present in the distillate.  What it shares in common with those other distilleries is that it reaches peak balance and complexity in its mid to late teens, so Mickey Head and team made a wise choice by fixing this new permanent lineup addition at 19 years old.  At this age, the smoke has softened up enough that it doesn't aggressively attack the palate, instead blending together flavors of long-steeped tea, cedar woodsmoke, and barbecue char in an intoxicating combination.  This whisky has pronounced streaks of brown sugar, caramel, and dark chocolate as well.  It's an overelaborated Michelin star restaurant dessert of a dram, and one of my favorite Ardbegs.  Although it's hard to find a direct comparison, Lagavulin Distiller's Edition has a similar profile and is close in age (around 17 years), for about $200 less.  In light of the stratospheric pricing, I have to deduct a half-star or so for this bottle."

4.5,"Delicate peat overlays pear and other fruit and herbal notes. A wonderful sipper, with the age clearly mellowing out any harshness it once had. The only knock against it is that it might be a bit too delicate for some."
4.25,"The nose isn't all that strong actually, though some smoke stands out - not so much peat, but there is some. It doesn't smell particularly sweet, though it does have some light fruity scents and a little bit of light bitter herbal nose. The palate is rich and full, starting with smoke, peat, and fruit. The fruit is a little hard to place, but I think it tastes a lot like apricot - really, it seems distinct from the pineapple that they claim. It's sweet, but rounded and rich. This is much closer to the 2019 supernova in quality than to the 2015. The flavors all balance nicely and it's quite tasty. This is definitely comparable to the 2019 Supernova in quality, though it tastes more like the 2015, but with some beautiful fruity richness that makes it what it always should have been. I see where the chili in the description comes in a bit, adding some spiciness and harshness in a way that is not out of place. There's some dark chocolate that blends well with the chili. The spices are balanced, with a little bit of cinnamon, some black pepper, and moderated clove that brings in soft tannins. There may be some peat, but it skirts tasting like gross bread. This is a great whiskey by any standard. I sure hope it isn't one that breaks the bank because I'd like a bottle. The chocolatey finish is really nice. This is super nice to drink. I'll go ahead and call this my favorite ardbeg release. It's so good, but sadly the price is far too high."
4.75,"As salty and acrid as the smell of an Ardbeg must be, as viscous and full as an oil lamp hanging on the bow of a ship that sails the ocean, along with cloves, orange, chocolate, licorice, vanilla and coconut. There is also a clear woody component, with pine needles and damp wood, resin, to which a hint of leather is added. All well balanced and harmonious, pungent.
Silky on the palate, it slips, leaving a patina almost chewable on the tongue, with the sweetness that caresses it with a sugary and caramelized profile, but you can't fool yourself, the peat is well present, moist and fleshy, with the acrid smoke that pinches the walls of the mouth. Liquorice and chocolate rest together, with the leather soaked by the splashes of the ocean as a counterpoint, leaving the citrus fruits (orange, but also a scratch of lemon peel) in the background. In length, on the damp wood of the bonfire are thrown some car tires, just to revive the atmosphere, with the peat that is still lively despite the not so young whisky. More coconut in the background. Moss. Complex and layered.
A finish that fills the mouth for a long time, with ash, ocean, chocolate, orange, leather... even the empty glass recalls the flavors just picked.
Rich and full without being explosive, age has greatly benefited this Ardbeg confirming its spirit, which is fully recognizable but reflective, with the strength softened by time but not bent. The aromas are well balanced, the alcohol content very centered, it requires attention and care, strange to say almost, but it is a meditative Ardbeg."
