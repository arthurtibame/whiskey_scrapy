3.25,Just ok

4.0,"Nose: Ripe bananas and cream, hints of maple and vanilla, ghosts of nutmeg and slightly floral

Palate: Toasted oak, cream, maple, turning slightly floral toward the finish 

Finish: Medium, with palate flavors giving way to slightly smoky barrel notes and a hint of nuttiness and pipe tobacco

It is hard to believe this is just 2 years old. This definitely benefits from opening up. I have had this bottle open a few months and it is far more impressive going back to it now."

4.25,"Really good. There’s a depth to it that I’ve never experienced before and can’t put my finger on it exactly. But I’m on the hunt for whiskeys that are more like this.
It is young (2yr) so I can’t wait for their 1st properly aged version that comes out later this year."

3.0,"Present immediately is the classic Lincoln Country Press profile you'd come to expect from drinking Jack and other Tennessee whiskies, with the bourbon picking up the faintest of smokey flavors in addition to the classic bourbon profile. Compared to a Jack Daniel's it's sweeter, a tad more complex, and owns a more pleasant mouth feel and taste.  This 2 yr version tastes very very young as the flavors are immature and a bit harsh. Needs around 2-3 more years in barrell, which is exactly what the distiller is planning."

5.0,This was a 2 yr reserve that I tried on the tour. It was the fourth one you tasted (out of five). Nutty and earthy aromas. Super excited to see how the 4 year batch turns out.
null,"I find it hard to really describe this, but I like it.  It has a really interesting, compelling  nose.  The taste is also quite distinctive.  I picked up some when I was in Nashville.  If you like whiskey I strongly recommend that you take the tour of the distillery next time you're in Nashville (which includes a tasting of their whisikies).  If you like, pick up a bottle (or two) of this stuff, because you can't buy it anywhere else."
4.0,Definitely a unique flavor to it...worth picking up if you go by the distillery
