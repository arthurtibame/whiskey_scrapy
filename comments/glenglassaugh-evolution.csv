4.25,"Bottle kill review.
Sweet bananas foster, butterscotch, creme brulee, cherry cola, and milk chocolate on the nose. The palate is creamy, a little young and hot, it's also sweet but not cloying with more butter scotch, bananas foster,  vanilla and caramel. The finish is long, sweet and peppery with more butter scotch and some toffee.
And, oh yeah, the empty glass is amazing, with all the various notes hanging on plus some added berries."
4.0,A very nice dram! 50 Abv and rich taste. It says Ex-Tennesee cask but it is a first fill.

3.75,"I am quite conflicted about how to score this product. In regards to flavor, texture, and finish I think that this bottling is an EASY 4 star or even 4.25. My conflict comes in regards to the 80$ that it costs in my area, and for 80$, one can purchase stagg jr, blanton, ECBP, Etc etc. So my score of 3.75 is in accordance with my overall rating, not just taste.
Taste, flavor and texture earn an easy 4 stars. With plent of sweet fruitiness and campfire flavors, there is a pleasant but mild burn (more likely due to the proof than a true 'spice' burn), and the texture is, while not oily, somewhat slick and smooth. If this were 20$ cheaper, I'd be blowing up every liquor store in Tenesse for a resupply! If youre a fan of somewhat light and bright, yet full and rich, fruity noted whiskey then this may be worth seeking out!"

4.25,"The aroma emanating from the glass is of unripe banana, a pinch of lemon, custard, nutmeg. Slight hint of wood in the background. Sweet but not too much, quite linear.
In the mouth it is very creamy and caressing, a fruit cake with cream: prickly pears, yellow grapes (almost vinous), peach, vanilla. A spicy touch cheers the tasting, with the alcoholic boost that adds color. Wood.
The finish is medium-long, of spiced wood, grapes and vanilla.
Curious whisky, not particularly complex but with unusual aromas, pleasantly original and far from boring.
For those who are not looking for strong emotions but even not trivial."

Comes across young and mildly astringent though. As cascode noted not really for someone who likes sherry bombs and powerful flavours....i.e. me :-). 3.5 placeholder rating but will be interesting to see how it evolves."

4.0,"Sitting a Vaughun's finishing up and, after taking an earlier account of their stock, I saved this one for after my dinner and to soak in Game 2 of the World Series.

This is a fresh fruitbowl of apples, pears and pineapples.  Given time, soft faints of charcoal appear and the sweeter vanilla notes.  A simple, delicate nose.

This arrives soft and creamy.  A mix of differentiaing flavors is intriguing and pleasant.  Orange creamsicle is the foundation flavor and supports the additional flavors of toasted coconut, ginger spice and apples. A touch of an oakiness begins as it fades to the finish.

A long lasting finish is welcoming as the diversity of flavors come through.  A citric lemon and orange bitters, countered by sweet coconut and pineapples; somewhat pina colada-ish.  A bit of ginger zing keeps the palate awake.  A drying woody sensation remains on the palate, akin to chewing on a toothpick.

As always, a touch of water smoothes and softens the zingy palate.  It also happens to draw out more of the tropical notes.  I preferred this with just a smidge of water.

Quite refreshing.  The tropical notes conjure a summer beach sunset on an soft sandy beach.  This is a perfect whisky to compliment that image (hopefully a reality for someone; namely me).  [88/100][Tasted @ Vaughan's, Hartford.  10/25/17]"

3.5,"Nose: Intensely fruity with apple, pear and a hint of over-ripe orange. Some banana and wafts of coconut as well as vanilla notes. After a while a definite oak character shows through which is when you figure out where all that fruit and vanilla came from - reasonably fresh ex-George Dickel casks. Ah ha!

Palate: Fruity but the main impression is of young, fresh barley. This is obviously a young spirit, but it is uninhibited and very enjoyable. Light and quite sweet with a certain brassy, grassy, hay-like undercurrent. Refreshing.

Finish: Surprisingly long and fruity sweet.

Quite delightful. Critically it has not been lauded, which I think is a shame as there is a lot to like here.  All up a real success. I'd recommend this to a friend, but maybe not one who only likes sherry bombs - this is a vigorous, young bourbon-driven experience.
    
Update: Near the end of the bottle, about 3 months later. This just gets better and better. Oxidization does it no harm at all and with time it gains some wonderful complexity. Great stuff.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

null,"Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. A very good expression with flavors of apples, sherried fruits, nuts, and spices."
4.0,Not sure I would go as high as 96 but absolutely deserving of the high praise. Look up “benchmark single malt” in the dictionary and this should be the example given. About the only thing I can criticize is the color (seems too light to be this good) but every other aspect falls within A-A+ range.
4.0,"Bought this on a whim. This is a young looking and tasting whisky but still manages to be pretty smooth and silky. The complexity is there with chocolate, vanilla, honey, floral and a hint of salt on the nose. Some apricot joins on the palate and at the back end a hint of peaty smoke. Very nice mouth feel, creamy. The finish is less interesting, floral and honey. Overall a very nice whiskey, would definitely buy again. Sometimes a whim pays off."

3.75,"I started looking around a few weeks ago for some scotch that would make a good summer sipper. I generally prefer bourbon in the summer, usually with a rock or two. So I wanted something on the sweet side that would stand up to ice. After reading a few reviews I found this. It fits the bill very nicely. 

Glenglassaugh Evolution is an NAS expression aged in first fill ex-Tennessee whiskey casks. It is non-chill filtered and has no color added, being a pale gold in the glass. It produces a few skinny legs when given a spin and is bottled at a respectable 50% ABV. 

The nose is wonderful sweet honeyed barley, orchard fruits, hints of dark malt, caramel, vanilla, just a slight burn. A few drops of water kills the burn and turns the nose slightly darker, more malty. Either way it’s really nice. 

In the mouth it’s sweet honeyed barley, mild heat, caramel, and vanilla. Wonderful bourbon influence, like blending bourbon and scotch. It has a fairly thin mouthfeel, but this does not detract from the experience. Water does the same for the palate that it does for the nose: tames some heat and brings out a darker, maltier tone. 

The finish is medium with oak, pepper, and hints of smoke. Water has no effect on the finish. Overall this is an excellent whisky that will make a pretty good summer sipper. Add to that a sub-$50 price tag and you have a winner. Solid 3.75/5."

NAS, non-chill filtered, no color, 50% abv 
 
Opened on a whim and wow, just wow!
This whisky...damn! 
Butterscotch, malt vanilla biscuit, sugar cookie...tropical fruit, hint of banana...tiny apples...flowers...coconut syrup(the kind you have in Hawaii)...touch of clay or putty way, way in the back...
The arrival is sweet and syrupy with a little tang.  Well balanced with its atmosphere. Development swells in intensity. I recon because of the taster preference of 50% abv. Thank you for that  Glenglassaugh.
 The finish is of a moderate duration leaving me with pear and oak and a kind of chewy-ness.

Highly recommend for the sweet seekers and also  a nice break for the peat seekers.

This distillery came back into production in 2008. So age statements are still pending. However if this is a sign of what’s to come...I anxiously await! And for all of that I would give this a gold medal. 94! Glenglassaugh you are onto something special. Keep up the the good work."

3.5,"My girlfriend and I have been working our way through a bottle of Evolution that we were given at a BenRiach event earlier this year. (We were given one each, actually, though I imagine the other one will end up in a Dirty Santa gift exchange before the end of the year.) As free bottles go, it’s hard to complain. The nose belies the Tennessee casks that incubated the whisky, with rich and creamy notes of toffee and butter. The taste is spicy and creamy, with rich chocolate biscuits of the Bourbon genre and a streak of caramelized sugar. At its bottling strength of 50%, it’s best drunk in small sips to fully appreciate the concentrated flavors. Unfortunately the finish is disappointing: the alcohol overpowers the other flavor components, perhaps belying a youthful nature to this NAS spirit. Water harms more than it helps, tempering the finish but muddying the nose and palate. Evolution’s name suggests it’s a work in progress; let’s hope future batches improve under the intelligent design of master blender Rachel Barrie."

4.0,"Glenglassaugh tasting evening, Sydney, Feb 19th. Whisky #1

Nose: Fragrant grassy malt, sweet honeyed cereal, tropical flowers and fruit, red apple and a hint of bubblegum. A dash of water brings out some oak from the background. [The dry glass is fragrant honey].

Palate: Sweet malty arrival with a hint of spice. The development brings a honeyed vanilla touch balanced by a light salt note. Adding water amplifies the spice and sweetness together. The texture is quite full and satisfying.

Finish: Medium/long. Stewed fruits with an earthy, grounded quality. There's a sweet cereal note in the aftertaste which is very pleasant.

A very fruity and fragrant nose (but I don't get the slightest hint of the ""campfire"" note mentioned in the official notes). The palate is very agreeable with no intrusive off notes, just a mild spice touch with a sweet, rich and slightly vegetal background that gives weight but is not cloying.  Great stuff.

I reviewed this about a year ago and at that time I thought it to be fruitier and lighter, but although the profile of this batch is richer the overall level of quality has not diminished - if anything, it has increased.

Note: In 2016 the distillery was bought (along with Benriach and Glendronach) by Brown Forman who own Jack Daniels, so since that time the whisky has been matured in JD casks instead of Dickel casks. Whether this will have any noticeable effect on the product we won't know for a few more years, but I'd doubt it would.

I think this is a greatly underestimated single malt. It has some qualities reminiscent of Bruichladdich and others that bring Mortlach to mind. The Glenglassaugh distillate is ""big"" and can handle forceful maturation in a wide array of casks, which is exactly what they do.

Previously I rated it at 3 stars (adjusted to 3.5 when the fractional system came in here). I'm increasing that again to 4, as this fully deserves the summary tag of ""very good"" (however I think the official score of 96 is way over the top - it's more like 90). Remarkably, it's also reasonably priced, to the point where I'd call this a bargain.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.25,"Very fragrant with honey and plums, mineral water, and dry white wine characteristics. A touch of smoke, mild pepper, tart apple frutiness, and salted pretzel palate, and the heat from the proof comes on stronger than you'd expect from the nose. Long finish, stewed vegetables and gentle wisps of smoke and pepper linger.

This is not an easily classified whisky. The closest might be Johnnie Walker Green, it pulls in a lot of directions but is still quite balanced. Very intriguing, one I think will need more tastings to appreciate."
