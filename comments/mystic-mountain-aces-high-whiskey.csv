2.5,"Appearance: Looking into my Glencairn the color of this blended American whiskey is a sweet corn light yellow. With a swirl I notice the legs are very thin and watery.

Nose: After my initial sniff, my first impression is “sweet.” Upon closer inspection I detect notes of caramel, cotton candy, Sour Patch Watermelon candy, and I also detect a note of carrot cake with the cream cheese frosting.

Taste: The body is well-rounded with just a small sharpness in the taste. The palate is not as pronounced as the nose, but I detect notes of oak, almond, sourdough pretzel, blackberry, and ash & BBQ char (This note coming from, if I were to guess, from the 8 charcoal filters used in production).

Finish: The finish is short and the final sensation is a clingy dry sour in the back of the throat.

Thoughts: In the overall category of “Blended American Whiskey” I find, at least in the whiskies I’ve tried, that products are either hit or miss. For me anyway, what I mean is other categories I have generally liked. Overall, they are good. In this category it’s a bit more risky because it could be good or crap. All that to say, I am happy with this whiskey and though it may not be the best or win an award from me, it’s a decent dram I’d be happy to drink. I say give it a try, it may be a hit or miss for you, but if you’re curious I’d say go for it. Mystic Mountain, thanks and keep it up! Cheers!"
