3.5,"Only 43% alcohol but it comes with a significant burn, just because it’s too young. If you put an ice cube in the glass and wait a few minutes, you can tame the alcohol and end up with a nice, pretty whiskey. But still.

I really ought to try making a highball out of it. It seems like that’s what it’s really for."
4.0,"Nose- herbal (rosemary,rose water, wild flowers) pear, honey, ginger, musty oak

Palate- honey, herbal notes of rosemary and wild flowers, white chocolate, orange peel, malt, light oak

Finish- Medium, oily finish with bright ginger and chocolate 

Very good. Does not disappoint, great for the price. Finish could be longer and could have a bit more complexity to it, but the more I sip the more flavors open up. By no means is it bold and in your face, more light and elegant, in all the best ways."

Viscous mouthfeel 
Gentle, fruity palette with a surprising but pleasant  burn closer to the tip of your tongue."
3.75,Smooth with light plum notes
3.25,"Honey, light vanilla, floral on the nose.  Palate is smooth, floral, creamy, slight pepper on the end with no alcohol burn to speak of.  Medium finish reinforcing the initial palate, but slightly dry. Decent choice to share with a new whiskey drinker, or as a first pour of an intro to Japanese Whiskey tasting."

3.5,"As hyped, just a wonderful blend of Japanese whiskey ticking off all the right boxes with finesse and elegance. Would love to score much higher but that would likely conflict with the aged statement examples going for big bucks. But if you took this NAS version and added some extra depth and complexity, would absolutely rate it as perfection. As it stands, it's an excellent Japanese NAS bottle at an accessible price so ig thumbs up."

3.5,"★★★½
Déception!
Après un coup de circuit avec les Quinta Ruban, me voici retiré sur trois prises avec ce whisky japonais trop cher pour ce qu'il a à offrir. J'ai l'impression de voguer sur une rivière limpide où une eau cristalline me comble de bonheur. Malheureusement, je ne me suis pas ici pour m'abreuver d'amour et d'eau fraîche!"

4.75,"I just realized i have never rated this whisky in barreled, i simply love this monster, it is one of my favorites and i am writing this review out of my memory. 

43%abv, burnished gold.

On the nose is so complex. It chanhes everytime you enter into the glencairn. Orange jam, floral notes, kiwi, lemon, chocolate, creme brulee. On the palate is full of oak, oranges, dark chocolate and it leaves you a full mouth sensation that starts in your tongue and starts building up till it reaches the top of your mouth.

I have drink it enough to low its original score (it was 100) to 97, but it is one of my all time favorites. Slainte!"

4.25,"Nose: Honey, floral notes, a hint of cinnamon

Palate: Quite smooth initially. Notes of peaches, cereals, cinnamon. Some sherry cask coming through. 

Finish: Short to medium. Mild to moderate burn and tannins. Dried fruits. Very slight hint of peat smoke.

Overall a very good whisky, but there are definitely much better values out there in the Japanese whisky category and any whisky category for that matter given this price point."

4.0,This can be a very divisive whiskey I have tried several bottles of it and every group I drink with has different things to say. For me I really like it. It is smooth and pleasant to drink neat or with a touch of water or a bit of ice. The flavor lingers in my mouth and it changes wonderfully and the burn is nice. I do think it is about $10 overpriced but it is a very good whiskey for special occasions but too pricey for an everyday drinker.

Overall the flavor is stronger than two other Japanese whiskies I've tried (Nikka Malt and Toki) but still more mellow than most Scotch."

4.5,"The smell of alcohol pours over the top of the glass on each approach. The harsh sense dissipates upon the taste of the refined liquid. The forward wood notes fill the pallet and are complemented by the balanced cherry and vanilla flavors.

4.0,Light burn
4.5,"Light and floral, almost a green apple on the nose. Super delicate and refreshing. Absolutely amazing"
4.0,"Nose: Sour Green Apple, Pear and  Persimmon,  Honey Dew Mellon and Red Plum. 

Opens with light malt and white wine becoming more substantial with some corn sugars and wood notes, the malt is carefully contained in percentage to prevent it from stepping on the finer notes and more subtle floral fragrances. 

Finishes slightly dry and pungent, incredibly pure and completely burn free. 

The latest standard ""Harmony"" offering from Suntori is a well refined exhibit in Japanese craftsmanship.  The array of subtle or even delicate notes persists with astonishing balance as the name ""Harmony"" truly stands up with dignified assurance.  Hibiki has become known as a brand that demands respect, and for good reason, this whiskey is a distilling essay on how to craft a balance of well blended notes into a carefully planned  impression.  An array of brilliant and strikingly well produced essences of whiskey.  That's Hibiki Harmony. Cheers!"

3.75,"Big vanilla and green apple nose with jasmine flower—smells amazing; fairly big burn for a blend by a major Japanese distiller, oak and apple with some honey; finishes with honey and persimmon; overall not as complex and fruity as the original hibiki and I will never forgive it for that, fair or not"
