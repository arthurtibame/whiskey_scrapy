5.0,"Nose - Vanilla, dark brown sugar, hint of dark cherries, very faint mint and possibly stale/old dill.
Taste - Hits the tongue spicy sweet of a vanilla caramel with a bit of freshly cracked black pepper. Cinnamon spice, faint mint/dill, buttery, yet dry.
Finish - Lingering buttery feel, cinnamon spice, mint is gone, but is more of a faint dill. Lightly oaky but almost no bitterness with a hint of slightly sour dark cherries.

3.0,"So my note is actually for Pikesville Supreme 80 proof Straight Rye Whiskey. I tasted it against Rittenhouse, my favorite rye. The nose (Pikesville) initially was strongly ethanol with mint and oak, mellowing with time in the glass to a buttery caramel. I tasted grassy cereal before a quick spicey burn with anise that lasted through a long finish. With a few drops of water the nose turned slightly yeasty and the flavor was sweeter and the burn was slower. The finish was a nice lingering spicey anise glow. As nice a dram as it was though, it was hands-down advantage to the Rittenhouse which was sharper, cleaner, sweet-tartier (spell check didn't like that word), with a nicer oily-sweet lingering finish. FWIW, Old Overholt straight from a pocket flask had characteristics of both."

4.0,"Gorgeous, rich nose: vanilla, creosote, an old leather armchair, cloves... the mouthfeel is amazing, fills your palate while toasting it with a pretty intense burn. Almost like it doesn't think you got enough up your nose already, so it tries the back door. Takes a couple of sips (or a bit of dilution) before the underlying flavours start to come through, but it's really all about the fire and spice. The finish is long, hot and full of flavours that you didn't even know were there: ginger biscuits, flamed orange peel, spiced mince pies, brandy soaked pannetone – there's nothing subtle about this whisky, it's a big rye-heavy punch on the nose; and its tremendous."

4.0,"Go-to rye, 2nd best only to Willett 3yr Rye. Overall 6th best of 60+ bourbons and ryes ever tasted, just after Bookers, Willett 3yr Rye, Dickel 9yr, and Johnny Drum. Better than High West Double Rye, Knob Creek Rye, and Colonel Taylor Rye, Baby Sazerac, and Basil Hayden's. Much, much better than Redemption 8yr Barrel Proof Rye with its overly dry/dill/medicinal finish.  A few drops of distilled water helps this. Just sweet enough to pair well with nearly anything. Often I finish tastings with this, as it's still attractive even after trying 20 whiskies. I look forward to comparing with High West Rendezvous Rye and Michter's Barrel Proof Rye (which is supposed to be slightly better, though at much higher cost). Higher proof, better aged version of Rittenhouse Rye."

4.0,"Maryland versus Pennsylvania is *the* rye debate. OK, maybe not, but much like how much of Western philosophy can be (over)reduced to a question of Plato vs Aristotle, rye whiskey tends to fall, for me, into two categories: mellower, sweeter ryes with plenty of other grains (usually corn) in the mash bill (aka Maryland style ryes), or punch-you-up spicy ryes that usually have very little of anything else in them (Pennsylvania style ryes). This is Maryland through and through, with a rich mouthfeel that delivers plenty of cinnamon, caraway, and spice, with the tiniest hint of dill, but wrapped up in enough of a blanket of caramel sweetness to soften the impact. Very enjoyable stuff!"

I was surprised the nose didn't give an earlier indicator of how strong this would be.   I didn't get the typical rye flavors of mint-eucalyptus, but instead a more chocolate-y leather profile...like a Speysider or Highlander.  Really a great sipper...add a touch of water, and the flavors open up.  Thanks Richard!"

4.0,Excellent value.  It's a softer gentler rye.  Good introduction for bourbon drinkers given its high corn content.  Arrival is sweet with caramel.  You get the rye notes in the development and finish.  Cereal and biscuit notes.  A hint of spices and not not much pepper.  I get a subtle chocolate note.  Even at 110 it handles well.  A touch of heat but is balanced well.

3.0,"If nothing else, the bottle itself is beautiful. Unremarkable colour (especially considering the high proof), and a nose that I would initially describe as . . . dusty. Just dust, caked dirt, gritty, something akin to a dry farmhouse. Persist and you get some nice baking and brining spice (lots of clove, anise, caraway seed, a touch of dill, faint mint), vanilla, fresh-cut lumber, and faint sweet cherry and grape. Surprisingly little burn at 110 proof, though the heat builds considerably on the tongue. A flavour that's quite mild--initial fresh grain, baking and brining spices, but it's an oddly thin character at this proof, and it's buttressed by a lot of dry-wood, toothpick-y bitterness. A bit of vanilla, faint cherry, apple and applewood. But a lot of fairly harsh graininess.  And a surprisingly short finish as well, that's dry and tannic. A bit of cinnamon and apple after a few sips. Curiously--and I'd have to do a side-by-side to confirm this--a bit of a disappointment: a notch below Rittenhouse for me, even at a much-inflated price. Not terrible, but stick with the Ritt."

Notes: This is my first time reviewing a rye whiskey. I’ve historically been pretty stuck in just bourbons, but have been enjoying ryes more as of late. There is two things I can say about tasting Pikesville 6 Year: I pick up quite a bit of Mr. Pibb flavor in here, from the nose into the finish there are notes of spiced cherry cola throughout; I’m definitely not mad about that. Secondly, this pour is not only spicy, it is hot. The heat persists from the first sip all the way the finish. Because of this, a few drops of water would do you good if the heat is a little much for you. Once the heat dissipates...say a minute or two after you drink, I start to taste come candy sweetness back in my cheeks. Ultimately, the flavor is solid, the color is gorgeous, and it comes in a handsome bottle, a nice addition to any collection"

4.0,"Paid $39.99 @ BevMo ($49.99 minus a $10 coupon).
At this price point, I don't think you can find a better Rye. Right upon entry you are hit with Vanilla, brown sugar and maple syrup. Pretty viscous for a 6 yr old Rye and baking spices begin to swell on the mid palatte. Finish is long with a kick of clove and a spicy oak finish. Incredibly smooth for 110 proof. Other than coming from the same distillery, it really doesn't share the same flavor profile as Rittenhouse. It is a superior dram in every way. Strong recommendation! 4.5/5"
5.0,"Pikesville Straight Rye is a ""barely legal"" rye whiskey, as its mashbill contains the minimum amount of rye (51%) to be called a rye whiskey.  As a result, the spice and the bite of the rye is softened by the  sweetness of the high corn content (39%).  Aged for six years in new charred oak barrels, the influence of the casks adds depth and complexity to the flavor profile.  At 55% ABV Pikesville drinks very well at full strength with very little alcohol burn.  However, I find that a splash of water opens up the whiskey, bringing out more dark fruit.  NOSE: Vanilla, Oak, Cherry Cola, Leather, Dill, Anise, Baked Apple, Cinnamon, Toffee.  PALATE: Caramel, Vanilla, Dark Fruit, Spicy Oak, Leather, Cinnamon, Dill.  FINISH: Dry... Oak, Leather, Dark Fruit, Cinnamon, Dill, Anise.  Pikesville is an incredible value at $50 and merits 4.5 stars.  I wish it had a higher rye content, but that's a minor complaint."

I say this with a healthy appreciation of Rittenhouse but for me, Pikesville just has a little something extra. The bump in proof goes a long way and this Rye has a few extra dimensions for me that Rittenhouse is lacking, tasting more refined and nuanced, at least to my palette. I love Ritt in a cocktail but it’s not a Rye I’d feel the need to sip per say. Pikesville I could go in either direction. Anywho, just my pair of pennies. Cheers!"

3.75,null
4.0,"55% abv (110 proof)

Nose: vanilla, sugar cookie and creamy rye spice. Almost dessert like. Touch of ginger and a hint of mint in the background.

Palate: caramel and big rye spice dominate; vanilla and brown sugar compliment on the development; hint of tart apple at the end; full, soft and mouth-coating texture.

Finish: medium length, nearly perfect balance of rye spice and bourbon notes; juicy fruit and spearmint and hint of cocoa pop up on the tail end.

Value: $45-55 bucks American. Worth it.

Final thoughts: this is simply a great rye whiskey that fits all moods. The rye spice is robust but not overpowering, leaving room for the barrel influence to shine. A dash or two of water balances this pour even further, making it enjoyable for high proof lovers as well as rye novices.

Score:

4/5

Everything in the aroma carries over into the taste which opens with sweet cinnamon, nut, and black cherry notes and then switches to a spicy almost chili pepper like finish. Not a lot of herbaceousness to this for a rye; just a hint of anise, clove, tobacco, and mint in the finish. Tastes more like a high-rye bourbon, but in my opinion is not a bad thing at all.

Mouthfeel is vicious and chewy. Finish is medium to long with a cocoa powder note coming after everything else fades. 

Can’t recommend this enough. Just delicious from start to finish."

The palate is very sweet with notes of maple, ginger, spiced apples, and cinnamon. Digging a little deeper, burnt brown sugar and dry roasted peanuts present themselves in the background. This tastes pretty smooth for being 110 proof.

3.75,"Take the last train to Pikesville and I'll meet you at the station,
be there by 4:30 for I've made your reservation..

Ok enough Monkeeying around,  (inspired by Olddude and maybe 4 other guys), Pikesville is a pretty heady rye, with a rich nose of sweet red hots and oranges and a touch of lemon grass, a nod of leather(old english) I like the direction Heaven Hill is going with this one.

Front: as advertised it is a rich dose of hot and spicy rye, there is no mistaking the distinct rye grain taste with some chaff and dusty barrel treatment riding shotgun.  Some dark brown sweetness, almost a molasses, makes a short appearance in the middle.   Anise and clove with nibs..(thanks Fafnir)

FInish: tapers off warm and salty, the rye grain is never ending loads of it and still warm burning down the gullet and yet smooth with hints of citrus.

After all this is a stout and only mildly cut, high proof libation,  this may be a serious rye drinkers rye as much as Willet or Whistle Pig considering the full bodied notes and lack of impurity.  The pricing on this bottle tends to be a bit high but there is a lot to offer here, I can get behind the idea of this being a ""go to""  bottle, much like the Knob and Russels Single Barrell ryes.  It seams Heaven Hill has their own entry in the serious but not exorbitantly priced  ryes market as well. 

Certainly a bottle any serious rye drinker would want but maybe not one that a novice rye drinker is ready for, a decent HH product all the same."

5.0,"110 Proof Pikesville Straight Rye. This Bad Boy of Rye is flavor busting, but with a very unique deep rich flavor profile, different than anything I have tasted before. The nose and taste of this reminds me of pecan shortbread cookies my wife makes for Christmas, that she dips half of each cookie in dark chocolate. Needless to say the nose is wonderful. The flavors are bursting with the bakery spices, chocolate, a good nuttiness, and shortbread cookies. This is a great flavor bomb and very unique too boot. The heat level is a little hot, but doesn't get in the way. Perfect sipper neat in a glencairn. I like Rittenhouse, but this Pikesville takes it off the charts. Great whiskey that I can get for mid 50's, and I'll say its worth it. I will get this again for a nice change and let me remind you - This Is Not A Normal Rye! Which is a good thing in this case!

4.0,"You know those drams where you wonder what it would be like if you could bump the ABV up to 46%, or the drams that make you wish they had a bit more depth of flavor, or the drams you wish you could turn the intensity up a few notches? 

This is not one of those drams. 

Enter Pikesville Straight Rye.  There’s been a lot of chatter about this rye recently, and even I had seek out a pour of it before hunting down a bottle (I previously reviewed this on the fly). When I found it on special for $40, I couldn’t resist. Let’s see this bottle’s specs. 

Mash Bill: 51% Rye, 35% Corn, 14% Malted Barley
Age: 6 years
ABV: 55%
Price: $39.99 (typically seen for $40-$50)

Nose: Rich and sweet. Red vine licorice, candied cherries, vanilla, rye spice, and burnt caramel with a bit of the accompanying smoke. All of this is enveloped in the aromas of a walk-in cigar humidor. The proof is suspiciously concealed. 

Palate: Rich, full-bodied, fruity, and spicy. The sweetness is definitely there but it’s almost an afterthought because there’s so much else going on.  Woody cigar tobacco, more red vine licorice, cherry syrup, and burnished crème brûlée crust. A tiny bit of balancing salt. Dangerously drinkable at full strength, water is unnecessary. 

Finish: My goodness, this is long and it hangs around afterwards. I’m curious if it smells like I was steeped in tobacco after drinking this. More spice and oak, leather, and burnt caramel sweetness. 

Overall Impressions: Highly enjoyable dram. I tasted this alongside it’s younger cousin, Rittenhouse Rye Bottled-in-Bond (review for this forthcoming). I’m finding conflicting information on Rittenhouse’s mash bill (I also found conflicting information on Pikesville’s mash bill until I confirmed it on a Heaven Hill page) and after tasting these side-by-side, it’s hard to imagine it’s just 2 years of age separating them. So I’m calling them cousins instead of brothers until this is clearer to me.

Verdict: This begs the question - if you could only have 1 rye....?  I’m unabashedly loyal to Rittenhouse for the balance of price, quality, and adeptness as a mixer. I imagine Pikesville could also be a great mixer, but at $40+ and with all these rich flavors, it would be remiss of me to cover them up. So I’d want to keep Rittenhouse around for my Manhattans and Pikesville for my sipper.*

For now, I’m feeling pretty good about sticking with my original rating of 4.0, but I’m very curious how this will evolve over the course of the bottle.**

4.0 ~ 88 ~ Great

*As a little tasting experiment, I also poured myself some Michter’s US*1 Single Barrel Straight Rye, a bottle Distiller describes as “Rich & Full Bodied”. Now, I know full well that this was a bit of an unfair comparison given how intense I knew the Pikesville was, but I did it any way for curiosity’s sake. The Michter’s transformed into a light, herbal, floral, and fruity dram, attributes not typically ascribed to it en masse. I won’t be writing up a review of this tasting of the Michter’s because it was a bit unfair, but it just goes to show you how powerful and rich the Pikesville is. 

**I’m also curious to see how Pikesville stacks up against its up-and-coming NAS brother, Elijah Craig Rye, which will launch with a limited release in January 2020 and is confirmed to share the same mash bill as Pikesville. Here’s to hoping I can get my hands on some to compare!"

4.25,"Nose: Comes in with a bit of nose hair scorching heat. Baked bread, cherry wood, and a kiss of spearmint. 

Palate: Richness is the key here. That baked bread with roasted almonds, homemade applesauce, and a round full baking spice.

Finish: This whiskey keeps going with it's finish. The age is noticeable with cinnamon and sweet oak, cigar tobacco, and a touch of leathery dryness. 

This is a great rye. Buy it!"

3.75,"Let’s get this out of the way early. I’m not a big rye fan. 

For me, rye is like the girl you keep going back to even though she inevitably burns you every time. Rye is my ex-girlfriend of the whiskey world. 

Moving on. In my latest transgression, I’ve seen a whole lotta chatter here and on YouTube about Pikesville. Pikesville is different they say. It’s a “barely legal” rye (a term I still don’t much care for). I thought to myself, “Balcones rye beat you up, Lot 40 was fun at first but then wrecked you, but maybe this time it’ll be better.” 

Well, so far so good. 

It looks like a rye, and smells like a rye, but the minute it hits your lips, it gets sweet. Sure there’s the spice, but it’s dressed up, gentler. That gives way to more brown sugars, cigar tobacco, and some caramel. It’s almost a bourbon in rye clothing. The finish from that 55% lingers but she’s warm and kind, not aggressive and temperamental like some ryes can be. This rye is all right. Maybe this one won’t burn me. Maybe this time it’ll be different. Maybe this rye is the one."
4.75,"Ive seen glowing reviews on this(really high score at Whiskey Jug) and was excited to try. This is basically Rittenhouse100 aged two more years with 10 more proof. Pikesville is only $11 more in my neck of the woods($39.99). Poured neat, nice dark color with nose of baking spices, cotton candy, smoky oak, dusty rye and faint dill. There is a whiff of ethanol but not overbearing. 110pf coats the glass well and has oily mouthfeel. Palate is a juggernaut of sweet spice, cooked molasses, burnt pie crust, raw vanilla, rye and oak with smoky heat throughout. Rich and absolutely delicious! It runs a little hot at proof yet still remains smooth. Finish goes into next week with lasting sweet smoky charred wood, toasty cinnamon and rye spice. Bold, brash and full of flavor the extra proof really bringing it. The powerful taste delivery reminds me of Old Grand Dad 114. If you are a fan of ryes buy it, its exceptional !! You will not be sorry......98/100.......New top dog rye for me. Going through this bottle Im now picking up a wonderful rich chocolate note. This rye is truly complex and fantastic!!..."

4.0,"So I checked out a new whisk(e)y spot that was recommended to me.  I liked the atmosphere of the place, but most of the pours were ridiculously overpriced.  Sure, there were some harder to find bottles (some Hibiki and BTAC to tempt me....) but don’t get me started on the prices (let’s just say $300 and up and we’re not talking about Port Ellen’s or Brora’s).  The list of highway robberies goes on and on.  $120 for a pour of Glendronach 19? $100 for Balvenie 21?  $80 for a pour of Birthday Bourbon?  Seriously?  These were not “venti”-sized pours either. 

Not to be deterred, and not to turn it into an evening of settling for overpriced cocktails, I did locate a bottle of the Pikesville Straight Rye tucked away on a shelf. 

For the sake of brevity and in light of the setting, I will treat this more as an “impressions” tasting - how much did I enjoy the qualities I experienced, what I liked or stood out, and where does it rank compared to other things I’ve tasted, etc. 

Everything I’ve read recently about this rye is true - different, delicious, rich, flavorful, balanced, and pleasant. It got better as I went along - layers of flavors uncovering themselves on subsequent tastes. It doesn’t drink like 110 proof either.  I would definitely pick up a bottle of this later to do a proper tasting and enjoy at home for much better VFM. 

This ranks right along with the other drams I’ve rated 4 stars. It may even deserve higher. I’ll update this score accordingly when I hunt down a bottle and open it up. Highly recommended, especially if you can find it for ~$40-$45 a bottle."

NOSE: Big and Bold. Dry and Dusty. Fall/Mulling Spices including Cinnamon, Clove and Orange Peel. Hay and Old Oak. The Orange Oil becomes dominant after time in the glass. A Floral Note also makes an appearance, but it flits around the edges, coming and going. There is some heat from the 110 proof. 
NEAT: Oily, Dense and Heavy. Spicy, but it enters a little sweeter than the nose would suggest with light Vanilla. Orange, Rye and Oak dominate the mid-palate. On my first pour I noted some astringency, but I get none from the second pour a couple months later. However, the Orange Oil note is much more prominent on my second tasting. Goes down with a nice warming sensation leaving a lasting coating tingly finish of White Pepper and Dry Dusty/Musty Oak. Damn this finish lasts forever, layering flavor on top of flavor with each sip. That's the hallmark of a great whiskey for me. 
SPLASH: A few drops of water makes the Orange Peel even more prominent and brings some added Brown Sugar Sweetness as well. A few more drops and the sweetness hints at Gooey Caramel. 
VERDICT: I'm glad I finally tried this one. It may be my favorite rye now that the High West Double Rye extra-aged stocks are gone. I picked this one up on sale for around $40, but it is usually closer to $50. It may not be a frequent buy for me as it is almost twice the price of Rittenhouse, but it has definitely earned a spot on my top shelf."

4.25,"Neat, neck pour.  I like this a lot on the nose.  Mild rye, sweet corn, light caramel, apple.  Light oak.  So inviting for a rye.

Viscous and syrupy in texture.  Very sweet and light on the tongue.  On the taste, rye quickly gives way to a vanilla angel food cake.  Oak and caramel come back on the legs.

I know this is a barely legal rye which explains the delicious qualities and lack of spice compared to other ryes.  This is one of my favorite ryes at this price point for sure."

3.75,This highlights rye over sweetness. The nose is eucalyptus mint and some toasted cinnamon and caramel. The pallet is sweet up front then spicy going down. Cherry and oak are added however the cherry gets dominated by the oak at the end of the bottle. A great bottle at a great price however I don’t know when I will get it again.
3.5,"Nose is vanilla, grass, and spice.

Taste is fresh cereals, leather, rye spice, and a light sweetness.

Finish is long from the high proof."

I've moved away from bourbon and rye drinking (or at least enjoyment of a lot of the entry to mid range stuff) in the last year or so but now and then you get flashes of perhaps not brilliance but a good combination of flavours, balance and quality at a decent price.

This is one of those drams for me that still keeps me dipping my toes and taste buds into the bourbon and rye whiskey world despite me falling out of love with the general flavour profile."

4.25,"I'm not a rye guy, but my brother is. So during Christmas we bought Old Forester 1920 and this to split. My main experiences with rye were: 1) superior ingredient to bourbon in cocktails, 2) sneaky good and cheap on the rocks options at bars like Jim Beam Rye, and 3) gross-tasting Bulleit Rye. Pikesville Rye has made me rethink the category.

The nose is so similar to high rye bourbons such as Four Roses, with just a little more cherry and rye kick. Strong aroma of orange/citrus, grass/corn dust, burnt caramel, cherries, and oak. I don't detect any licorice or eucalyptus that I've gotten in 95% rye mashbills. I really hate licorice so this was a welcome reprieve.

The high rye spice and oak continue on the palate, it definitely shows its age and proof after a few seconds. The cherry flavor really stands out on the tongue. I can see why people think cherry cola when tasting this, but honestly a sugary soda of any kind tastes nothing like whiskey. The spice really comes out in the finish, with strong peppery notes. It begins to have a cherry medicinal quality towards the end, and this is really the only thing that is holding me back from giving it a 4.5. I wish that flavored cough syrup note didn't appear.

If you're a bourbon drinker and have been turned off by high rye whiskeys, definitely try this or start cheaper with Rittenhouse. I've had a few nice ryes since purchasing Pikesville, but none have been as good."

4.25,"This one is surprisingly a long time coming. I'm fairly sure (although not certain) that I sampled this while at the distillery, side by side with Rittenhouse. Of course, with Rittenhouse being a superior rye, it was even more surprising to find that I fell for this one (or so I remember). So, I finally picked up a bottle of ""top shelf Rittenhouse.""

The nose invites fresh rye, but also a much deeper blend of spice, likely from the longer aging. It seems like a simple scent of cinnamon mellowed out with oak and caramel, but of course, the best things usually are simple.

The initial taste is almost that of a high-rye bourbon, which is to say oily, obviously full of rye spice, but letting the oak and vanilla take point. Then, like one of the best magic tricks I've seen in a while, the cinnamon (mellowed much more with age than one would taste from Rittenhouse, however) explodes forth when given air. It doesn't stop there, though; as more air is introduced, slight hints of freshly cut grass, more oak, and more of the oily body come into play, like Pikesville shouted invites from the rooftops to this party that they're having.

The finish, as a good rye whiskey should be, burns the mouth, but not from alcohol, oh no, but with the cinnamon spice of a challenging spice candy. It's a much longer finish than that of Rittenhouse, which really defines who the big brother is here. If my distillery adventure truly wasn't a fever dream, then me saying out loud during tasting, ""I remember why I love this whiskey so much"" makes sense. Thank your god that the Heaven Hill bandwagon finally broke down. I like their products as much as any other normal collector, but now that the media train is on Buffalo Trace (for reasons unknown to the universe), I can seemingly enjoy their products, including this one, much more now that I can find it without going on side quests."
