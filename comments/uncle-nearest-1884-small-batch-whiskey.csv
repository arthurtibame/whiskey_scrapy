2.75,"Uncle Nearest 1884 Small Batch
Pours in to my Glencairn the color of very light tan suede. Takes while to form small slow moving droplets.
NOSE: Thin (I know thin isn't a smell, but more of an impression) and Stinging Hot. Not very complex. Corn Dust and Oak. Maybe a little Banana? There was a floral note initially but it faded rather quickly. 
NEAT: Enters the palate very sweet with Caramel and Light Banana. On the Mid-palate this is Hot & Young and it moves right to a Hot Bitter Medium Length Finish. Mouthfeel is relatively thin. If this is Seven Years Old, I'll eat mine and your hat. 
SPLASH: Improves the palate a good deal just by reducing the heat, but doesn't really add any flavors or depth. Does make the mouthfeel a little creamier. If this is going to be finished anytime soon, it will be with a splash or a large cube.
VERDICT: I'd been tempted by the UN1856 on shelves here locally, but hadn't bitten. When this one popped into my Facebook feed for $50 with a flat rate shipping rate of $5, I bit on impulse. Something I probably wouldn't have done in a brick and mortar store. I figured I was pretty safe. Sourced Tennessee? Has to be Dickel, and I love Cascade Hollow (sorry, can't make myself type the words ""I love Dickel""). A claim of 7yrs? That is a decent age. Those factors all played a part in my decision. After sampling I researched and read that this was supposedly sourced from two different TN companies. Leaving out Jack (who claims to not source) who else has 7 year old stocks in TN? The fact that the word Straight can not be found on the bottle anywhere should also have been a red flag. If this is truly 7 Years Old, what prevents them from calling it straight? Aged in used barrels perhaps? A mix of Bourbon and Rye mash bills? I'm hoping that this is one of those bottles that get better after it's opened. If so I'll report back and let you know, but for now I'm giving this one a too kind 2.75."
4.75,Lovely whiskey to ring in the New Year and any occasion!

3.25,"Nose.... Soft notes of bananas, nutmeg and caramel are prominent...

Color... Dark gold, almost slightly amber..

Taste...Balanced and smooth, and not at all overpowering, this is creamy and corn rich.   Notes of vanilla and cherry come through after breathing it in...

Overall... This is definitely a mixer for me. While I do enjoy the taste, it just doesn't have much complexity from start to finish.  I'll keep this around, but cannot suggest it.. Beginners whiskey..."
