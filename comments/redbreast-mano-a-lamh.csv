4.25,"A weekend of 4 Irish whiskey samples.

3/4 Redbreast Mano a Lámh (2000 bottles limited release / 17-20 years old / sherry butt only)

Nose: the sherry cask only maturation of course crushes your nose buds. Thick orange sultana syrup sprinkled with burned caramelized sugar spices with cinnamon and powdered ginger and sprayed with fresh lime juice

Palate: spicy, mildly hot and oily. Some flavorful oak tannins. Hard to explain but very unusual and really good. 

Finish: the caramel and oak are accompanied with the intense sherry into a very long finish

Although I’m not really a fan of sherry cask maturation this one is really enjoyable. The characteristic single pots still taste of Irish whisky is something you really need to get used to and this whisky really demonstrates this quite intensely. But it is so brilliantly put together that combined it all falls in place so well. Every stage is impressive and really intense and deep. 

This was my third pour of this whiskey and this was the last time I will get to taste it. Forever. A once in a lifetime opportunity and I’m glad I had it. A Irish friend of mine had one of the 2000 produced bottles and now it is empty and I was given a last sample bottle from him."
