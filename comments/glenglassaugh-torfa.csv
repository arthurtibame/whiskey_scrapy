4.0,"A good amount of smoke, I could smell it before I even put my nose to the glass. Also hay, lemon, honey. Buttery, rich taste with a bit of a candy finish. Had a bite at first, but by the end of the glass the butterscotch was dominating. Fine quality NAS, and easy drinking for 50%. Hard to find in America (I got it at the fabled Julio's in Massachusetts), worth picking up if you see it and you're looking for something different."
5.0,"Quelle experience! Excellent whisky, subtilement tourbé. Superbe. Il vaut son 92 donné par distiller."
3.0,"Vanilla and pear on the nose with just a hint of iodine. Peat not super strong, but this is HOT.  A few drops of water cools it off and brings out the palate of smoked meat and chocolate.  Its still a hot finish"

4.0,"A nose filled with slight sweet peat, cotton candy, ginger, and apricots. The palate brings oak, black jelly beans, heather, honey, and brine. The finish is a gentle roll over of smoke and sweetness that lasts a medium length. Thanks so much Paul for the experience, and I will have to give this one a 4.5. The non chill filtering, and no coloring added, is a definite bonus. The theme of this dram should be something sweet, but powerful, like ""Rocket"" by the Smashing Pumpkins."

4.0,"Did somebody splash Lagavulin in my Kilkerran 12? That's one way to think of this whisky, which I ordered a sample of on the strength of the reviews here. The pale straw liquid introduces itself with lucious smoky aromas and a dash of pencil eraser. The flavors are citrus, sweet and oily, with the lemon notes accentuated by a drop of water. The finish is just a tad dry and pleasantly bitter. Friends, please welcome another member to the Big Bang for the Buck club."

5.0,"Dear Ardbeg,
I'm sorry for my wandering eyes which led me to this one night stand with Ms. Torfa.  I couldn't help it.  As much as I love your briny salty aromas, followed by that peaty, smoky taste, Ms. Torfa offered me the same but with a significant discount.  She lured me with those ""come hither"" smell of peat and brine from yards away, as the bartender opened her up.  She then fully captured me after that beef jerky, ocean water up your nostrils, BBQ taste.  But, don't worry...you're still my favorite...it's just that when I'm tight on funds, I now have another that I can go to."
3.0,String peat start. Better with water. Would not buy.
5.0,"Oh god what Scottish wizardry! An absolutely wonderful dram, with a nose you smell 6 feet away. It's complex, satisfying, full and long, with sweet peat, honey, cut grass, and apples along the journey. What a revelation, especially on the finish!"

4.0,"With a low-medium peat level (20 ppm), this very young bourbon-barreled Speyside is an excellent mix of a rich and sweet whisky (as promised), with earthy peat, smoked meats, and a vanilla sweetness. https://youtu.be/72vISN75EUA."
4.0,"Nose: Spice, orange zest, warm pie crust
Palate: Deep, warm, velvety. Refined on the tongue but sprightly on the sides. 
Finish: Shortbread cookie turning into warm pudding. Medium-long finish. 
Notes: Lovely all around

3.0,"Scotland trip update, tried this dram at Amber Bar in Edinburgh, one of the best and most affordable places in the city and my No. 1 recommendation for a whisky bar there.  Torfa is most similar to, but not quite as good as, Ledaig 10.  It’s all acrid peat and citrus on the nose, followed by an earthy palate of chewy loam and sharp orange citrus again.  The finish continues with that sharp, slightly astringent peat note.  It’s a hair too harsh and sharp, and I say this as a devoted fan of Laphroaig, Lagavulin, Ardbeg, etc."

4.0,"Un nez assez rond, très proche du classique de Speyside. On sait qu'il est tourbé mais c'est très léger.
En bouche, la tourbe se révèle vraiment, c'est chaleureux mais en même temps acidulé. Assez fort, épicé mais la rondeur est très agréable.
La finale est longue et très sympa, légèrement acidulée sur la langue."

3.5,"Sweet, a little herbal, and smoky. Not quite bonfire, not quite seaweed smoke either. It’s medium on both. A tad hot, add a drop of water, it improves it. One review said pepper on the palate, it’s there. The finish is smoke, an almost candy sweetness, then smoke again, a tad bitter and then it’s gone after 30 seconds or so. Definitely worth trying if your easing into smoke or peat."
3.25,"Mild, smooth, very light peat smoke"
3.5,"Has almost a coastal nose with plenty of smoke.  It has sort of a smokey meat scent.

This is quite peaty - it has a sweet middle, butterscotch and barley malt, and a smokey hot finish.  I definitely get malted barley on the tongue early and late, but it kinda fades with the smoke in the middle. Salt and pepper, pepper, pepper, and more pepper.  Tingly pepper, it actually reminds me of tingly sensation caused by szechuan peppercorns.  It does have a beef jerky flavor.  The balance of the whole package is not quite there, but I like this whiskey.  It's an enjoyable drink and this would be a great pair for smokey barbecue."
4.0,Peat and grain on nose. Some spice and peat and vanilla on palate. Smooth sweet finish.

4.0,"Very nice.  Tastes like a cloud of smoke surrounding lighter, sweeter flavors."
4.0,"Very nice dram Clear, a little but smoky and sweet Well balanced"
3.75,"Torfa is apparently the Old Norse for turf. Bit of hard work there for the etymologists.  

This is Glenglassaugh's first foray (since its reopening I guess) into a peated malt and at 20ppm it is on the lighter end of the bog band. That might give the impression that it is a little restrained or muted. Not so. It is a sprightly young NAS, matured solely in ex-bourbon barrels and, with 50% abv, it delivers a nice kick.

The nose is of light, sweet peat smoke mingled with citrus; a youngish waft but not an off-putting ethanol or acetone smell. Just an airy manner of freshness and youth. 

The taste delivers a pepper smack and a playful alcohol jab initially. Enough to widen the eyes and waken the senses. A sweet orange develops with supporting salty, oaky notes. The peat smoke is most prominent at the finish and it is fairly strong - probably another indicator of its youth. The lingering finish is a salty, sweet peat that is mmm-mm-mmm. 

That's the way to do it. In your face Ledaig 10!"

4.0,"A cold Friday evening finds me finally getting some time to sample this whisky provide by @Generously_Paul  Threw on Portlandia from the DVR (even catching up on tv shows, let alone my samples).

Subtle peat and maritime brine/seaweed are introduction to this dram.  As you work the nose, a touch of iodine comes through with the fruits: apples, lightly toasted coconut, pineapples. Throw some vanilla cream to top it off. 

The whisky arrives on a thin, weightless and silky body but delivers a spectrum of flavors.  Smoked bacon or jerky, white sugar sweetness, butterscotch and fresh ginger root.  At the tail end, a flash of banana pops in and immediately out. You can feel the transition from sweet to zing very linearly: point A to point B. 

What remains is charcoal and earthy. Black pepper that fades to bitter dark chocolate and oak.  The soul is left quite warmed. 

From start to finish this whisky delivers rich, bright and full aromas and flavors. If this whisky could be improved it would be to lengthen the finish. A quality whisky that is unfortunately not readily available (at least near me).  [90/100][Tasted:2/9/18]"
4.0,"Sweet mild peat, hint of barbecue apple and ginger as GP and LeeE noted. The alcohol / spirit integrates well....I thought maybe a point or two down would let more flavour come through but a drop or two of water didn't do anything. Not as complicated new make as Craiagellachie 13 but like that drop it's very well balanced. Reminds me of the 22 year peated Connemara I had last week (which I preferred although it's 3 times the price) without the mild buttery oiliness. $60USD here in NZ and a solid 4 for me."
4.0,"Stop number 61 on the SDT is Glenglassaugh. This Highland distillery was founded in 1875 and was producing single malts (mostly for blending) for over 100 years until it was mothballed in 1986 during the great whisky recession. It sat dormant until it was sold in 2008. Production resumed and Torfa (Old Norse for turf and turf meaning peat in this case) is one of the first offerings from the newly matured whisky. 

Torfa is a NAS expression peated to a level of 20ppm and is 100% ex-bourbon matured. It’s bottled at 50% ABV, non chill filtered and natural color of pale straw. 

The nose is intensely sweet and fruity with a backbone of smoky peat. Peaches and cream and pie crust...basically a peach pie with whipped cream. Apricots, white grape juice, apple juice. Lemon/lime citrus and candied pineapple, pears, oranges and tangerines. Surprisingly I got sunflower seeds/oil. It was brief but there, not something I’ve ever noticed before in a whisky. Pickled ginger, vanilla custard, buttercream frosting. The peat makes itself known here with sweet smoky bacon, brown sugar glazed ham and pan fried whitefish. Olive oil brine and soot. Black licorice candy and after a while some mint. Towards the end it turns grassy with dry hay. Much more complex than I would have guessed. 

The palate arrives with a burst of sweet peat. Lemon custard, peaches, apricots, pears and apples. Smoked ham, bacon and brisket. Light spice in the way of black pepper, ginger and cinnamon. A bit of vanilla and butterscotch with a hint of golden raisins. A very light oak, almost completely hidden. As @Telex noted, I get black licorice jelly beans. Slightly vegetal/ earthy, like unwashed celery. Peat smoke, not too strong though, but just enough to be really good. 

Light to medium bodied. Oily, creamy and mouth coating. 
The finish, unfortunately, is on the short side. Smoky with a general sweetness. 

I was surprised by the sheer sweetness here, especially considering that it’s all from bourbon casks. Very fruity and quite smoky for being only 20ppm. I suspect we are dealing with refill casks since it is a very light color even at 50% ABV, which would suggest that most of what I am smelling and tasting is distillery character and not casks influence. Still it’s damn good very drinkable at 50%, no water needed.  I’d love to try this with a sherry or port finish. I paid $70 for this bottle and it’s right on the edge of worth it/ not worth it, but I say it’s worth a try. A stronger finish would have pushed this to a 4.5, but I’m giving it a 4-4.25. 
Cheers"

4.0,"I randomly selected another fine sample from our distillery tour samples last night.  The Glenglassaugh Torfa was supplied by @Generously_Paul in this round.  It’s their take on a peated whisky.  It comes in at a strong 50% ABV and is a pale, straw color in the Glencairn.

The nose is really smoky- BBQ’d bacon and brisket with a heavy sweet fudge and toffee hiding just behind it.  There’s no sea air or salt notes here at all.  Sweet barbecue smoke...and it is amazing.

The first thing I noticed on the palate is that it’s velvety smooth.  There’s smoke, chocolate and hints of vanilla.  They dance around wonderfully and keep all of the heat well restrained, especially for a 100 proof whisky.

The finish is sublime.  There’s a very nice buttery warmth that just lingers on and on.  Those same chocolate and toffee notes sort of dry coat the tongue and will stay there until you rinse them away.

Overall, I really like this malt.  The constant presence of underlying sweetness doesn’t sound like it should be there in a peated malt, but Glenglassaugh somehow makes it work.  It’s a sweet dram, no doubt, but the smoky meats and peat really work here, too.  This bottle runs about $70 and I think I could find room for this during some tasting sessions from time to time.  It’s a solid whisky that I really recommend.  It’s a good way to introduce a newbie to peated whisky.  Thanks for the sample, Paul.  4.25 stars."

2.0,"Ostra i mocna, z lodem pali w mordę niczym tania berbelucha, z wodą idzie wypić, ale smakuje rozwodniony, z sokiem jabłkowym ma intrygujący smak, z cola paskuda"
4.0,"The color in the glass is full gold.
The nose is very fresh and sweet, with vanilla, caramel, melon and a persistent herbaceous scent. The peat is little more than an ethereal puff of smoke that twists the aromas, more marine than fleshy (one reviewer I read speaks of ""smoked herring"", and I would say that makes the idea).
On the palate the youthfulness of the malt is felt, at times almost cloying, were it not that the alcohol breaks the tone giving the boost to the mineral peat, still accompanied by caramel and ripe fruit. A touch of pepper and ginger revive the taste, which however remains always very fresh and pleasant, alternating sweetness and salinity in a fairly balanced way. To be peaty, I must say that there is little smoke here, we are more on a meadow overlooking the ocean to munch a ripe melon, looking for someone who has a lighter.
And evidently in the end we found them, because in the end here comes some ash with fruit and a touch of ginger, medium long."

4.0,"Glenglassaugh tasting evening, Sydney, Feb 19th. Whisky #7

Nose: Fragrant sweet smoke balanced by citrus fruitiness and floral hints, but the nose is solidly founded on the crisp, clean smoke.  Over time beeswax, lemon, dried fruit, coconut, crème brûlée, pineapple and a delicate cinnamon spice all emerge. [The dry-glass aroma is honeyed smoke].

Palate: Sweet, buttery, lightly briny and smoky arrival - like kippers cured in brown sugar. A resinous note from the cask and a little raisin sweetness come out in the development, together with mild ginger spice, but hot on their heels is whole a bushel of fresh tropical and stone fruit. The texture is creamy and satisfying.

Finish: Medium/long. Faintly salty smoke.

This was the 7th offering on the tasting night and although the 42 year old expression before it was an impossible act to follow the peated whisky had to be the last performance of the show.

It's a very approachable, sweet, floral, peaty dram. Somewhat reminiscent of Connemara Turf Mór but with greater body and complexity.  The pervasive smoke that propels this is not a west coast medicinal sort of smoke - it's much softer and woodier and more like Benromach smoke.

The nose is complex but restrained and takes a while to develop, but the real heart of this whisky, and what makes it work so well, is the oily and dulcet character of the nose and palate. This gives the spirit a creamy weight to offset the relatively high abv and allows the aromas and flavours to shine out.  Recommended.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars."
