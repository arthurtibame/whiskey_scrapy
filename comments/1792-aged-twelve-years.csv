3.75,"Another day and another allocated Bourbon found its way into my market! This was one that I had been half heartedly hunting given my lack of enthusiasm for big oak. However, today when it fell in my lap at SRP (49.99) I just went for it. Let's see how it tastes:

On the palette it's reserved with big vanilla, toffee and cocoa notes... This leads to clove and nutmeg.. oak is a late big arrival with a dash of cinnamon and a hint of leather on the medium finish.

Overall it's quite a lovely dram. Simple, well aged Bourbon with no frills. $49.99 seems about right for this experience. Is it worth hunting? Not really. Is it the best 1792 release? Outside of some great FP Picks, 💯. 

So in summation, definitely a buy at SRP and hard pass beyond that! Cheers all!"

4.0,I was expecting more from a 12 year. That said this one is still very good. I got a sweet vanilla with oak taste. Again I expected more oak upfront with a 12 year.
2.0,Not my first choice.

Cherry and oak on the front with a finish of leather that dries quickly"

4.0,"I found this 1792 offering to be an expanded and noticeably seasoned upgrade from some of the younger expressions. This is a full, rich & creamy experience. The nose mixes baking spice, vanilla & toasted almond. The flavors to me are salted caramel & big creme brûlée’s. The finish is nice & pleasant. This would be an excellent frequent dram if more readily available."
