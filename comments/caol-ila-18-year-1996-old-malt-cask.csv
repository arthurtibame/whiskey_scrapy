3.75,"At most parties, there is at least one character behaving a bit peculiar, as if not belonging to the group. That's the one. In a blind tasting, I would have taken this 1996 Caol Ila from Hunter Laing for a Laphroaig. The nose features musty, earthy peat smoke, briny seaweed, pears and loads of white pepper. At first sip, your palate is hit by a pyroclastic flow of dusty peatiness followed by coal ash, subtle vanilla and lemon zest. Over-brewed tea and wood spices dominate the medium finish. With that being said, I'm somewhat disgusted but weirdly fascinated.
