3.0,"Ohio Dept. of Liquor Control delisted this juice so I've been picking these up for $21.00 lately. it's a nice mellow theater that doesn't linger long in the tongue with tastes of light oak and Carmel, but it's not very complex. while it's what what I've been paying for it I still would like to see what develops with more time on the barrel."
