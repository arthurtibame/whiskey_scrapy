4.5,"This guy found it's way back home from Japan by way of a fellow bourbon brother, fortunate for me!

NOSE: Heavy oak and vanilla extract dominate the nose upfront with a subtle baking spice trying to peak through.

TASTE:  Flat Cola with a spicy honey lead the charge with a hint of orange zest and caramel chews laying in the background.

FINISH: Very bold up front with flavor and light burn the sustains through the sip, fades quickly leaving you wanting another.

 BODY: Light and clean, slightest oil that is gone in a flash, well balanced.

OVERALL: Loved it, even without it being cask strength it still packs a punch with full flavor. Blantons does it again.

As always keep drinking my friends, Skol!"
5.0,Smooth with a strong Oak finish.
