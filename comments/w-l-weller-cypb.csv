4.0,"This is lovely, as all Wellers tend to be - mellow, sweet, almost coquettish with the short finish but mature in choice of perfume. LOVE the way this smells. Reminds one what Bourbon should be. Only detraction is a personal one: I want the proof jacked up by about 10. But I like my firewater to whip me on the way out."

4.0,"Slow start to the legs, dripping down the glass then catching up mid-way. 
    
    The nose is sweet, medium in intensity - crisp apricot, green apple, butterscotch, wildflower honey, oak, leather, grape candy, orange peel. 
    
    The palate is soft and gentle to start - a buttery mouthfeel without a lot of complexity - candied sugar, vanilla, butterscotch, cake batter, lavender - rye-like cinnamon spice finishing the sips with a medium length. By comparison to the 107 might have you thinking the 107 has bigger sweetness (and at the same time, more spice on intro), but going back to the CYPB I think definitely shows a rounder sweetness, and an oakier sweetness. 
    
    That said, when blind and the 107 tamed with a bit of water to even the playing field,  I still had 107  take the win on my first rodeo with this new limited edition. 
    
    That said, the CYPB is continually offering up sweetness when drinking it alone. Each sip grows sweeter compounded on the previous sip. As it opens up I hope to keep finding more layers that I didn’t in the first visit. 

UPDATE 8/14: Another pour, this time along W12.  Much more difficult to differentiate. The nose on this pour just rules - it is everything you want in a bourbon nose. I personally favored the sweetness of the CYPB to the 12, but noticed it was a slight bit harsh to drink compared to the more mellow 12. That said, you still get, perhaps more, oaky sweetness out of the CYPB. 

Personality in favor of polish, this definitely made me look at the CYPB differently. It is a really lovely drinker."

3.0,"Weller CYOB is a limited edition Weller product. It's  95 proof. Aged for 8 years on the highest floor of the rickhouse according to the back of the bottle. This one I have yet to see in the wild and would anticipate it would fetch more than Weller 12 if you can find it online. 
Tasting: 
Sweet Brown sugar and vanilla upon entry. Clove kick on the mid pallette with a medium length oak and leather finish. Real nice pour, however, still not on the level of the Weller 12 yr. It's far more complex than the special reserve and a smoother pour. I would rate this a little below the Antique as I prefer the higher proof.
Definitely worth getting a pour if you can find one for a reasonable price.
 If you can find a bottle for $50 or less it's worth it. North of that you would be wasting $$ unless you just want to have a limited edition Weller Bottling. 
3.5/5 based on the price I paid for the pour. Glad to have tasted it but I don't think I will spend a whole lot of time hunting for it."

3.0,"Hey these things actually open and don’t just sell for outrageous prices on secondary! This is the new release from the Weller line. Aged 8 years, 95 proof, and stored on the top floor of the rick house. Picked up for $45

Nose: Picking up mostly light fruity notes, more specifically citrus. Not a great deal different from WSR, but the flavors are more pronounced.

Taste: Tasting this alongside WSR to keep myself in check. Oh yeah, this is a sweet one. Cherry, caramel, and vanilla are the three main players in this one. Mint follows behind them all as a secondary player.

Finish: This is where CYPB blows WSR out of the water. Whereas WSR has a pretty short finish, CYPB has nice caramel notes that linger on for awhile after swallowing. Again, mint notes follow behind, but the caramel is the leading flavor.

Overall: Yeah this is good. I’d grab this all day for $45, but definitely not for the $350 it’s been going for on secondary. Probably my favorite of the Weller line, granted I didn’t care for W12 too much.

Cheers!"

3.25,"This is a case of “don’t meet your heroes.” A disappointment when held against both Antique 107 (especially great store picks) and the 12 year. The nose is its best quality, fruity, sweet, inviting. On the palate, an herbal licorice, oak, and hint of leather, but short of the 12 year’s depth. Short finish."

null,"Friday, after a long week- saw this bad boy on the shelf and i I figured what the heck- 
Boom! Signature BT nose - reminiscent of a pappy 10 with a little more citrus. 
Palate: hot! The oak sets in after a few seconds along with a light sweetness- orange peel comes to mind. 
The finish is dry and short. 

I’d have to put this one side by side with other Weller to decipher the difference - but if you can find this bottle at retail-  I think it’s a great collector bourbon."

3.75,Just slightly better than Special Reserve. if you can find this at MSRP buy it. I would even give you permission to pay 100 for it. it's not worth 110 dollars for something that barely beats SR at 23 bucks or loses to antique at 30 dollars. your paying to complete your collection and that's it with this one.

3.5,Having a hard time with this one. Want to like it but seems lacking. Nose is sweet with cherry and vanilla. Taste is thin with not much besides oak and burn. Finish is the same. I think I will stick with the 107.
3.0,"So this is a batch 2, no clue if they're different.

Nose - Classic wheater notes. Unlike the standard weller's 107 and SR this has a good bit of oak note. The nose is far more aggressive and intense than the 107 despite the lower abv. I get cherry candy, vanilla...you know it's like the cherry Twizzlers a bit. Super sweet now getting fruity jams in the back end. 

Taste - I get more of that cherry, there's a bit of rye spice to it, oak gives it a bit of a waxy muted thing with some nice oak. 

OK so the question of the night. 107 vs CYPB. Now this is going to sound crazy but the 107 has less flavor. It has a hotter finish (heck of a lot more kentucky hug). But the 107 is smooth and mellow up front then turns into heat and gives a strong oak kick. The CYPB is sweeter, more mouth filling, mouth coating, and finishes much smoother (yeah I know meaningless) where their is still oak and some rye spice giving it a kick the 107 kicks way harder. I think the CYPB's cherry and waxy oak note are different from the 107's more caramel and oak forward notes.

For those who saw my negative review of the 107, I'm comparing it to a FAR better 107 bottle which would get scored higher, so I did make sure to not only compare it to a 107 but a good bottling of 107.

Verdict?  I'm taking the CYPB and I hate saying it because I really want to hate this.

50 bucks (48.98). I don't like the 107 for this price. I'm ok with this at that price. 3.0.  Please don't pay secondary for it."

3.5,"2019.  

Very smooth and sweet.  Classic bourbon vanilla and toffee.  Totally delicious palate, but relatively thin and one-dimensional.  Negligible finish.  To me, it’s a direct competitor to Elijah Craig.  Ultimately, that means it’s an extremely respectable bourbon, delicious, and a great value for the money at $24.  Potentially worth up to $35 or $40 on its merits (tasted blind) depending on your palate.  Might be worth up to $100 based on the label and scarcity economics.  Not worth whatever in the world $300+ it costs on secondary.  Do your part and ignore it if overpriced.  Otherwise: great stuff, Buffalo Trace.  Thanks for making great bourbon!"

4.0,"My local ABC store guy let me know when he got this one in last summer (I think I paid $40?). I opened and sampled it fairly quickly and don't remember much other than I wasn't very impressed. It got pushed to the back of the cabinet and I never reviewed it. Sat down yesterday after mowing the lawn and rectified that situation.
NOSE: A typical Weller nose of Brown Sugar, Pralines, Salted Buttery Caramel, Polished Oak, Leather, and Hay. More time in the glass and some of the saltier notes become dominant. However, there is a big shot of alcohol sting that really throws it off.
NEAT: Thinnish mouthfeel. Tons of Oak, backed by Vanilla, and Poppycock Toffee Popcorn. Just the right amount of Heat. It finishes with a decent Kentucky Hug that leaves an Oak Tanin and Vanilla coating, but there is an astringency throughout that mars the overall experience somewhat. 
SPLASH: A few drops of water saves this one. Gives the nose a Cherry Cola and Maple Syrup vibe, and gets rid of the alcohol sting. The mouthfeel becomes creamier and gets the cherry note as well. Now this is how I remember a Weller tasting! Completely eliminates the offensive astringency while leaving the oak. Amazing what a difference a few drops of water makes here.
VERDICT: Maybe there's a reason Distillers don't let their customers ""craft their bourbon"". Pulling all the barrels for this one from the top floors may seem like a good idea to most, but I really think it caused the offending astringent note here. I was definitely disappointed in CYPB until I added a few drops of water. It really opened it up and improved the pour. The only other bourbon that I can remember benefitting this much from a splash was Rebel Yell 10. Ironically, another wheated Mashbill. 3.75 Neat, but 4.25 with a Splash. I'll average them for a 4."

4.25,"Saw it in a bar. $13 for 2 ounces, had to try it. Tasting in a strange glass, kind of like a giant glencairn and I mean like 4x the size.

The nose has strawberry laffy taffy, raspberries, baking spices, cotton candy, baking spices and maple syrup.

The palate has a light oily texture with some nice spices, leather, oak and the strawberry laffy taffy still comes through.

Finish has vanilla, baking spices, and some lingering strawberry taffy.

This was very interesting. It basically tasted like a fruitier/berry version of Weller Antique. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I’ve never gotten strawberry laffy taffy in a bourbon before."
