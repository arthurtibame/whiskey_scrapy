4.25,"And final posting for Dramfest 2020!

A new NZ distillery which does great stuff. It was in partnership with NZ Spirit Workshops but then split up. I think the distillate or at least the equipment is the same which is impressive as the NZ SW stuff was terrible...

Now I had a good chat to them and apparently they get all their micro barrels from Tasmania as there is a place which gets all the Aussie and other barrels in then restaves them and exports or sells them on. All their stuff was great...finally 2 decent whisky distillery's in NZ."
