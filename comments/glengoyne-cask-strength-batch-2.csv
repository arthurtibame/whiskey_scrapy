4.0,"This is a whiskey that you do not taste unnoticed. Flavour comes in quickly and stays long and intense.
A joy to drink."

4.0,A good cask strength whisky for sure.  Well priced and delivers a real punch of flavour.  Quite a bit of heat indicates fairly young whisky.

2.0,"Batch 004 (8.20.17). Pretty ""in your face"" all around. Will give you a pick me up. Not subtle. Not complicated."
5.0,"I've got a batch 4 bottle.

Nosing it I get a tart winey smell, with icing sugar developing after a while. strong alcohol throughout.

taste is firey, very very rich. Oak-y, charr, banana and spice. it finishes prickly but a banana charr taste stays on the palate for a while."
3.0,High vanilla to the nose. First sip you can definitely tell the high alcohol - ethanol taste. Watered down is a better. Might buy again

3.5,"veldig sterk og litt stram, men fremdeles preget av en mild glengoyne smak"
