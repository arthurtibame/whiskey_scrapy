2.0,Floral elements with peat and light smoke. Not a lot of depth/refinement. Like a smoked Bushmills. $39 in Ontario.

3.0,"77% Esthétiquement a la hauteur, et difficilement égalable au même prix. Le genre de bouteille que sa prend dans son armoire pour initié des moldus."
3.0,"Rich flavor, with a bit of smoke and peat. Water is a critical tool to enjoyment. Make sure to add a little, really opens up the other flavors."

5.0,"I was recommended this and I'm glad I tried this.
Normally the mix of grain and peat is awful, but here the sweetness of the grain and peat work, each addimg their own for freshness to the complex malt!"
4.0,"Four-star quality, five-star value. On the nose, there's thick honey, light smoke (campfire, not vegetal), big seaside-y brine. Moist cake (vanilla!) and nuts. A bit of water brings out some light fruitiness. On the taste, more peat and smoke, big brine, and a nice butterscotch. Peppery and citrusy. Dry smoke & spice finish. Canada and France account for more than 50% of Té Bheag's sales; I'm not sure you can even *find* it in a lot of other places. But it's sub-$40 Cdn. and just a remarkably lovely value whisky. Punches well above its weight-class."

3.0,"Blended scotches aren't my cup of tea, but this isn't bad. It's ever so lightly peated and spicy. Lacks both body and finish, but it's not much to complain about considering the price."

3.0,This is a very savory whisky I rate it 3.5/5. It tastes like smoked herring in a glass. Strangely this whisky is very creamy and not fruity at all. Also really salty tasting

4.0,"Chocolaty toffee on the nose, hint of peat and smoke, but with something slightly, vanishingly metallic that I cannot quite place. On the palate, sweet 'n' salty notes, along with that peaty smoke you expect, concluding with a lingering, warm, savoury finish. An impressive performance for a NAS blend, and for $40.50 in Ontario, a great value."

3.0,"Peat smoke, brine, and hints of vanilla on the nose. Thin and light-bodied, with orchard fruit, caramel and cinnamon on the palate. The finish is short and spicy. Serviceable, inexpensive and easy drinking."

    Blended By Praban na Linne (Prah Bawn Nah Linne)  Linne=(small body of water) Shabeen of the Pool  Shabeen=Roadhouse, house pub
    
                  Let it sit in the Glass 30 minutes
    
    COLOR: Medium Reddish Brown with a number of Legs Running Slowly. Nice Ring
    
    NOSE: Brine, Licorice
    
    PALETTE: Light Creamy Mouth Feel Sweet Arrival with Licorice. Peat Smoke Rises nicely as I swirl it; Mixing with the Sweetness. Some Light Pepper. Light Sweetness remains amidst the Peat Smoke.
    
    FINISH: Light Sweetness going down; followed by Drying with Some Pepper, Briney Notes remain as I breathe along with Licorice and a Hint of Peat Smoke
    
    This is my 2nd Glass, In My opinion, this is a Very Good Blended Peated Scottish Whiskey. The Light Sweetness on the Palette mixes nicely with BUT is Not overwhelmed by the Peat Smoke. A Flavorful combination. I would prefer a Thicker Mouth Feel from this NON-CHILL FILTERED Blend, but there is a Nice combination of Licorice Sweetness with Peat Smoke.
    
    As an IRISH Gaelic Speaker, I greatly appreciate the significant use of SCOTTISH Gaelic in the Name and the rest of the Label. The Isle of Skye along with some of the other Scottish Islands has a small but significant Gaelic Speaking population and this Blender is Keen to uphold it,  MAITH SIBH (Mah or My Shiv) Good For You (Plural)"

3.75,"Sometimes it ends up being a contest between a prize-fighter whisky and a journeyman whisky.  The prize-fighter whisky comfortably gained the upper hand here.  But I enjoyed the bout.  And that journeyman whisky didn’t just roll over. I winced at some of its blows.

Té Bheag is a blended Scotch from the Isle of Skye which has a high malt content (40%) but I’d say that the grainy elements are the plodding palooka in this case. 

Shuffling away from the grainy elements, the better aspects of the nose were a briny maritime breeze, seaweed and salt, shortbread biscuits, roasted nuts, woodland aroma (resin?) and the pleasant smell of firelighters.  The taste hits all the right notes but not at the right volume. Light peat, light salt/brine, lemon rind and lightly sherried sweetness. Is that a little Talisker pepper I detect on the finish? It melts away well with malty grapefruit and a lingering oak that veers close to being too tannic.

Overall it’s a fine blend. Much better in my opinion than the blended malt Monkey Shoulder. A better Grouse. A less famous one, however. But spread the word quietly - it deserves more recognition."
