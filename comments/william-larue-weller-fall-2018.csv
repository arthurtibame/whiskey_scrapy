2.5,"Funky on the nose. Not what I remember from WLWs of the past. Initial taste was a burst of red fruit, followed by a long bitter/tannic finish.  Was not impressed.  Ranked this 3rd amongst the 2018 THH and GTS."

4.5,"Rich, buttery, maple roll goodness. Cinammon spices and dark honey spread on wheat toast. The finish is sweet and spicy and lingers and it's wonderful. 

The hype is real. This bourbon is fantastic. No way I'll pay the near $700 secondary price but I'd stock up at or near retail."

4.5,Lots of vanilla
4.5,"Great pour! 
On the nose strong dose of ethanol and maybe fruit and spice. The longer it sits the more oak I smell. 

Palate I find the fruit starts to define itself as cherries. It like a spicy cherry pie. Pretty decent amount of spice 

Finish is excellent. Spice...fruit...finally some oak. Great Slice of pie!

Overall this bourbon is even all the way through. Nose to palate to finish. Some bourbons have a great nose and or wonderful palate then lacking a finish. I really enjoyed this pour and was extremely happy to have the chance to purchase this bourbon from my local store at MSRP. Thank you Johnathon at Maisanos."

4.5,"Tasted 12/31/18 at Last Hurrah, Boston

The nose is very interesting, something I have never smelled before. I almost want to call it a spoiled milk smell, but still overall nice. This must be the butter aromas coming out. The palate is extremely complex and the finish seems like it goes on forever. For a wheated high proof bourbon it definitely has a kick to it, but that is partially why we like it. 

Price is based off a 2oz pour!"
4.5,"Whereas this year’s George T. Stagg tempers it’s usual attitude a bit (in a delightful way), William Larue Weller does the opposite. So much sweet fruit - the familiar profile of cherries, dark fruit like raisins and blackberries, brown sugar - but this year there’s notes of cinnamon spice that have this feeling like a bolder bourbon than in years past. Some hints of smoke, oak, and leather join for the finish. As usual, this one’s a real stunner."

4.5,"Spicy nose with an undertone of honey and apricot. Sweet undertone starting immediately then subsiding to spice and burn peaking at the finish. Richness and complexity falls almost entirely in the back. This is a great bourbon, but impossible to find and expensive too."
5.0,"Nose: Caramel, maple syrup, butter, cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla and a hint of mint. 

Palate: This wheated mash bill carries an extremely smooth, creamy, full bodied, rich palate that you can practically chew on. Hosting a balanced medley of vanilla wafers, caramel, dark chocolate, oak, brown sugar and cinnamon, it’s simply divine intervention that all these notes sing together in harmony and not one overcrowding the other. 

Finish: The finish is long, bold and full allowing the palate to loiter for days as it’s got no better place to go. Charred oak, caramel, maple syrup, heat, brown sugar and toffee lingering in the background waiting to be found. 

Overall: At 125.7 proof, this juice is as good as it gets and by far my favorite out of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. It’s truly a masterpiece in a beautiful bottle waiting to be discovered.  Be careful, w it’s accompanying high heat one may be forced to say Dracarys...which can lead to its flavor profiles being overwhelmed, if so add a teaspoon of water and listen to it sing."

4.5,"Nose: distinctive from staff and van winkle, almost mossy, salted caramel green apple, honey dew, tannin, and water makes this floral

Body: medium, oily and water makes is more enveloping. 

Palate: loads of cherries, mainly dark cherry, light spice reminiscent of old rip van winkle 10, nutty and light caramel with water

Finish: smooth, dark chocolate, lingers. 

Note: not as spicy as PVW or ORVW or stagg. Distinct flavors especially the dark chocolate cherry. This really hits me as all about the cherries."
3.0,"This was 31 USD for 1.5 oz pour

Sample rating: Average +5.5

If you factor in the MRSP price of $99, this would be 4.5 / 5 stars.
If you factor in the secondary market price of $800, this would be 1.5 / 5 stars.
I’m going to average this out to 3 stars.

William Larue Weller is a spicy red succubus on the nose, a confectionary supernova on the palate, and molten oak slag on the finish.  My favorite WLW was 2013.  2016 was almost as good, and this expression has gotten worse each year after 2016.  This is still a decent pour to try for $30, as it gives you mounds of brown sugar, waterfalls of maple syrup, fistfuls of nutmeg, sprinkles of paprika, and all the cinnamon in the world.  The amplitude is 11.  This is Pappy Van Tingle from the roof of the mouth to the bottom of the balls.  Fuck a hug; this is a Kentucky chokehold.  And I just had to tap out towards the finish, where it becomes hot, bitter, woody punishment.  Even with water.  After I finished, a mint saved my life.  

Good Lord, nobody will accuse this 2018 WLW of being subtle."

5.0,"Wow.  The ""It's Bourbon Night"" folks described this as ""it smells like my hopes and dreams"".  Let's just say I was angry when it was done because it was so good, it was done, and because secondary prices are stupid and I can't find a bottle.  Period.

Nose: Honey, vanilla, slightly tart apples like yellow delicious, slight grassy notes, butterscotch, and very little alcohol for such a high proof whiskey.  Off the charts amazing!

Flavor: Crème brulee, caramel, slight apple fruitiness, toffee, burn from the alcohol.  Super buttery like buttered rum and caramel sauce.

Finish: A long finish starting with oak and then heading back towards buttery toffee.

Seriously.  This stuff lives up to the hype."

5.0,"I've been blessed to try a lot of world class whiskies lately, to the point it's going to seem like I'm very excitable and indiscriminate in my 5 star ratings. But this earns it.

N: Coffee, nutmeg, cardamom, maple, banana bread, candied pecans.

P: Rich dark fruits, cinnamon, warming pepper, woody tannins, tremendous balance. The high proof is snugly hidden.

F: long finish from the pepper, molasses sweetness, and barrel note almond-like bitterness."

4.0,"Verdict:  balanced but spicy sweet like a stir fry.  Not exactly what I was expecting.  Very well crafted, enjoyable, but I won’t hunt for it.  Not exactly the profile I am drawn to.  I’d reach for GTS first.

1 oz pour, neat in a rocks glass.

Medium amber gold, about average for bourbon.  Oily.  Long, slow legs.

In a rocks glass, so not ideal, but the nose is mostly muted.  A simple honey note and a hint of toast.  Pleasant but not special.  No ethanol.  Stuck my nose in there for 30 seconds and no burn, a surprise for the proof.

The taste is quite spicy and complex.  Some from the proof, some just the flavor.  Tart red berries, cayenne, and honey.  Sweetness is just a component, not a driving force like some bourbons.  A hint of medicine/licorice, and very noticeable barrel notes throughout.  Some oak tannins, but the char is more prominent and persistent.

A predictably long finish that leaves the lips and roof of the mouth tingling.

Revisiting after a just a couple drops of water from a cocktail straw, the bite of the spice is tamed, and sweetness takes over.  Easier to hold on the tongue and enjoy.  Wish I had a bigger pour to keep proofing it down and explore it further."
4.75,"Well gents, you know the only good thing about about Tom Brady getting another ring? A Patriots fan deciding to crack and pour this beauty. The final instalment of my SuperBowl drams is a unicorn and one of the only BTAC I have yet to taste. Eyeballing it, it's a 1.5 oz pour neat in an old fashioned glass. Since this was my only pour of it my notes are limited but here goes:
On the pallette it's so viscous and oily with cherries and an assortment of dark fruits with just a hint of cocoa. There is definitely a spice undertone. This sweet and spice theme carries thru the mid pallette and long finish. You do get a wonderful hug and bursting dried red fruit notes with a constant spice undertone. Oak is also present throughout but is not too drying. Lovely dram and I wish I had more of it to ponder. At first blush I do prefer both Stagg and Sazerac to this one however, it's really nit picking. They are all wonderful in their own right! Cheers all!"

5.0,"This is easily one of the most amazing whiskey I’ve ever tried. The nose is like golden delicious apples, creme caramel, vanilla ice cream, rich buttery notes, and a light wood spice, with hints of grassiness. The high proof is only barely noticeable. The palate starts out with mildly toasted sugars, honey roasted pecans, and a bit of apple, before exploding into toffee, vanilla, creme brûlée, some truly beautiful pastry notes, and a mild bit of fudge and apple. The mid palate to the finish shows a transition from the sweet dessert-filled notes on the front towards a mild and almost unreasonably delicious wood spice, trailing off into rich caramels, baked apples, and a warm Kentucky hug. I’ve never been so sad to see an empty glass. This was a bit steep at $70 USD for a pour, but truly amazing stuff."
4.5,"I was surprised that this whiskey had such a high proof, because I could discern more aromas than I normally could for such a high proof bourbon.  french toast breakfast is the best way to characterize the nose.  after my first taste, I was surprised at the butter that leapt out at my nose.  

taste is much like the smell. it finishes more savory with a little sweet - maybe bacon dipped in Maple syrup.  interestingly, the empty glass smelled like Earl grey tea - black tea with oranges. very cool!

at first, when I tasted and smelled this whiskey, I was underwhelmed.  however, as I drank more, it began to grow on me.  it's a cool microcosm of a brunch.  it started at 3.75 to 4.  by the end of my drink, I was up to 4.25-4.5.  worth trying and savoring!"
5.0,Best on the rocks. Really good.
5.0,"Sweet very floral nose - this smells absolutely wonderful - I get a bit if Rose's and spice with some charcoal/barrel notes.

The palate has some fruity floral notes typical of the Weller family.  There us a rich caramel flavor on the tongue that evolves into burnt brown sugar.  It's very floral with barrel notes.  I get a bit of butter, apples, spice, with a long dry finish with fruit, wood, and burnt brown sugar."
4.5,Strong Cherries and vanilla aromas and great vanilla and Caramel flavor with a finish that melts away in your mouth.
4.0,"I couldn't believe how not amazing this was.  Super hot, and not in a good way. First drink of the night so maybe I didn't warm up to it. I could tell it had good flavor but it wasn't something I'll try again.  I feel crazy saying that."

This whiskey has some strong fangs with a long burn and an even longer finish. This one's hug is long and warm like a hug from grandma. 

It tastes of vanilla and apples with cinnamon on the edges of the tongue. It really tastes like a really good cinnamon apple fritter with an emphasis on a thick vanilla glaze.

The finish is like chewing on a hard caramel for several minutes."

4.5,"I have had every single offering in the Weller line except this one, until now...This was a sample given to me during a bottle trade.

The nose has wheat toast, rich milk chocolate, dark cherries, cooked red apples, spicey oak, and old leather. Almost like a chocolate covered cherry (which is not my favorite thing to eat, but this nose is amazing!). 

The palate is sweet, thick and oily with a drying effect on the tongue. I get dark cherries, a little apple, caramel sweetness and some leather. 

The finish is long with tingling on the tip of the tongue and a little burn in the middle of the chest. Cherry-vanilla flavors linger on the tongue.

Wow, very good and well balanced. This is my first WLW and I’m happy to say that I am a fan!"
