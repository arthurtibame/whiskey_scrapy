3.75,"Golden in color. Pretty intense notes of pear/apple cider on the nose. Nice, smooth mouthfeel with just a tinge of heat. Traditional Scotch flavor profile with moderate wood coming through on the backend. A couple drops of water lessens the creamy mouthfeel, but adds some fruitiness. Solid Scotch, especially for an Oban lover. 3.85."

3.75,"Like a new recruit to the Night’s Watch, this whisky evolves over time from a timid nervous boy into something more formidable. By which I mean the flavors are a little muted at first, but get more pronounced with time in glass. There’s a lightly sherried nose, a rich fruity palate and a finish that is savory, nutty and tangy, with a drop of honey at the end. A satisfying dram for cold nights guarding the wall, or just watching other people do it on TV."

4.0,Rich and smooth. Delicious. The Greyjoy from Talisker is still my favorite of this set.
3.5,"This is nice. Sweet & smokey on the nose with floral hints.  The mouth is smokey, floral honey woodsy that has a slight heat that creeps in.  Finish was a little dry and not as a deep robustness that I prefer.  But ya know, everybody's taste palate is different.  For me, the 1 bottle was good for purchase and glad to find one outside of the second hand market."
4.25,"appley sweetness, cream, and a touch of smoke make for this honorable dram. the part of the Diageo release i was most excited for and now i can say it did not disappoint. and now, my watch has ended"

2.75,"It’s unique. Does have some smoke/peat that hits immediately. Then some sour. Kinda like a green apple. Woodsy. Overall unique combo of flavors. 

Love the bottle design. Will say that of all of the GOT bottles, Talisker, Lagavulin, and Royal Lochnagar are the best."
null,Anyone know where I can order this in the States. It’s the last Game of Thrones bottle for my set?
4.25,Yum. The right balance between smoke & sweet.

3.75,Briney apple heather nose with candied fruits and a hint of smoke. Taste is candied fruit and some peaty herbal notes with smoke and apple. Nice finish of smoke and wood with some fruit notes.

4.0,"Not super educated on scotch yet, but this one definitely has the smokiness that is characteristic of the spirit.  When you add a few drops of water or an ice cube you get more of the sweetness and floral scent.  Delicious."

2.25,"The game of thrones bottles have gotten insanely popular but this one for some reason is going for well in excess of even some of the good ones.  I have no idea what's driving this. 

So first comment all of these bottles are comically overly colored and this one is no exception despite having an all black bottle.  I don't really get it.  And of course 43% because I guess it's cheaper?  

Nose - lemon grass, salt, a touch of peat, and a bit of malt.  

Taste - A mix of citrus, bitter, and sweet.  This is actually pretty darn complex bringing in a nice bit of sea, oak, and sweet.  You get a note of younger oak.  The mouth feel starts decently when it starts but once you get used to the strong citrus notes it starts tasting more watery.  

I intended to be pretty critical of this one, but it's been opening up since I bought it and frankly it's a pretty good dram.  Should you seek it out?  God no...it's just ok whisky and any markup would be absurd.  That said if you have some locally for a fair price, pick it up, it's a great bottom shelf scotch that you can drink straight."

Un whisky qui fait peur!
Enfin un whisky qui nous donne de l'émotion. Un aime la complexité de ce scotch qui nous enrobe la bouche d'une multitude de saveurs. C'est complet, c'est osé, c'est ce qu'on aurait aimé de tous les whiskys de la série Game of Thrones."

4.0,"Nose; smells almost golden, light, honey notes. The nose is soft. Touch of seaspray.

Taste; Smooth and effortless. The barely floats across the mouth. The oak only just makes an appearance. The sugars are there, but small, a supporting role. Then again there are no main actors here, this is a balance of supporting roles. The finish is nice, if not a little non-descript, it seems to just linger on the tongue."

3.75,"Nose: pops of fruit quickly curtailed by hints of smoke, wood, and ethanol.

Taste: bright fruit, maybe even citrus as it touches your tongue. Malt and sherry come through strong but are balanced out by a delightful cream. Slight smokiness, but nothing overbearing. Decent mouthfeel and overall rich taste.

Finish: medium - neither short nor long - oak/wood, slight smoke, faint honey, and absolutely delightful tobacco"

4.25,"Bright and fruity on the nose, with hints of apple, cherry and honey sweetness and very little smoke. Tiny bit of alcohol burn on the tongue, so this is likely a relatively young scotch. Still maintains the bright fruitiness of the nose and the apple shines through especially well. A bit of leather on the back end and some smoke on the finish too. Overall a very nice and interesting sram, that could really be perfected with a bit more time in the barrel."
3.5,Mild smoke and peat. Harsh at first with a smooth finish.

4.0,"Light amber color.
Smoke with sweetness on the nose. Definitely smells of apple and pear. Hint of vanilla on a second sniff.

Fist taste- spicy with some peat. Mild alcohol burn with a barbecue aftertaste.

Adding water - burn goes away, smoke but no rubber like a heavily peated whisky. Definite fruit and vanilla on the aftertaste."
4.25,"Yet another Game of Thrones whisky, and to be honest this is actually a good expression. Maybe the second best after the great Lagavulin 9yo. Oban always live to the expectation and even if this is one very straightforward dram, it is a very enjoyable one as well.

If served in a blind tasting you wouldn't guess it is an Oban.

Bottled at 43%abv

On the nose: Blackberry marmalade, dim Liquorice notes, Strawberry and more Red fruits.

On the palate, Pepper and cinnamon. Red fruits marmalade. Jam. 

Aftertaste is salty with hints of liquorice. This is the only moment you actually experience some of the classic salty notes from Oban. 

Overall this is an easy drinkable whisky. For the Game of Thrones collection it mantains the mood of the whole set, easy drinkable, not bad but nothing remarkable. 84 over 100."

I like these Speysides :)"

4.75,"Night Watch’s Oban Bay

Nose: 
Honey Sickle bread Ripe Peaches 🍑 , faint flint, faint strawberry, cherry candies, cocoa powder, and a buttery note to the malt.

Front: 
Malty with very floral peach forward and cherry, damp oak, and cocoa. 

End/Finish: 
Sweet spice and heat come slowly and lingers for a good minute 

“So have dram and love the moment my friends!”
“Cheers!”"
3.5,"Sweet nose, with carrots. Mild peat and sweet bread."
3.75,"Nose: Cherry with a little spice. Some sweetness. Slightly smokey as well. It smells vaguely like a sea breeze to me, I’m fond of the salty aroma.

Palate: Salty in the best way. Malty and smokey but pretty subtle. Hint of caramel.

Finish: Smokier on the finish than on the palate. Sweetness and fruitiness. And the smoke is a nice touch and keeps it smooth.

Overall Thoughts: The nose does happen to be the most intricate part. It’s a fine dram and I’m happy to savor the bottle for the novelty as well as the quality. I very much enjoyed this and will continue to do so."

3.75,"Based on some reviews here and elsewhere I poured this took a quick sip and then let it sit for 30 minutes. It smelled and tasted completely different (all in a good way) after the time in the glass so I’m reviewing it based on that and you should consider drinking it that way if you ask me. At least the neck pour 🤷‍♂️. This is in a rocks glass. I’ll be pouring into a glencairn as soon as I can and will update if necessary.
That long winded nonsense being said, my review will be pretty short. The nose is all citrus. It’s quite wonderful actually. Just based on that I’d probably be closer to a 4.5. The palate has an enormous salt note. I did my research and was prepared for it but it’s still a bit shocking. I’m told that’s normal for Oban but I have more experience with Lagavulin and Talisker from Diageo than I do with Oban. The citrus is still there too. I wish it was more prominent than the salt but it’s not. There’s also some sherry instilled berry notes but, again, more background to the saltiness. The finish is surprisingly long and I appreciate that.
For an NAS with a ridiculous focus on packaging (black bottle, black tube, GoT Night’s Watch mantra on the front of the label etc.) I was worried this was going to be trash. It’s not. It’s not awesome but I like it. I’d definitely go with the Talisker or Lagavulin GOT bottle if you only want one. I bet with a sweet dessert the salty aspect would feel savory (like bacon on a donut). I’ll have to try that. On its own I’d drink it. I’m glad I have a bottle. But I wish I paid retail NOW compared to when it came out."
3.5,"Very light nose. Takes a while to open up. Some orchard and dried fruits. Cloves and pumpkin I am getting. Actually it becomes better over time and lets you assume the potential this whisky would have with a higher ABV and some more years in the cask. 

The palate actually has a good portion of smoke from the charred / toasted casks I assume. You get dry dates, raisins and ripe lemon. A nice apple sourness as well as spiced yellow fruit punch.

You really need to give this whisky time. It really improves on the palate if give it the chance and a couple of minutes between sips. 

I must say what disappointed me is that there is nothing really that I would associate with the Night’s Watch. There is neither ice nor rough-/toughness of the north nor cold wet celtic weather. I really thought somehow that these Game of Thrones whiskies are kinda reflect their title in their taste. If I had to I would more attribute this to Arryn or Riverlands or Bravos but definitely not The Wall or the North in general. But I like it."
