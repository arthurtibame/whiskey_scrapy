4.5,"Nov 2019.
Clear medium dark gold to amber.
Medium small tulip.
Aromatic vanilla, heavily roasted coffee beans, sweet spicy, old leather, honey, toffee, and forest tree bark in the bouquet.
Full body with lots of wood spicy, toasted bread Christmas cake, tiramisu, and caramel brûlée in palate.
Good balance medium long finish.

Pack of flavor, vanillic and wood aroma, lingering spices at the end."
