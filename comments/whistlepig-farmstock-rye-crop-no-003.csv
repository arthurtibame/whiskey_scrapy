3.0,"While there is a lot going on with this bottle, the finish is overwhelmed by the youngest addition to the blend.  I understand the why, but I think this would have been better if the 3YR stuff was more like 30-40% of the mix, at 52% that young rye just takes over.  All in all, not a bad dram, definitely has a Canadian front, very smooth and sweet, middle brings out cherry, butterscotch, caramel.  The finish is pure grass to me, just young rye.  This is one I'll keep on the bar for a conversation starter, but not a go-to bottle for me."

3.0,Tasty. Long finish.  Not too much heat
3.75,Solid rye flavor with a more unique finish. The finish seems more earthy than other ryes. Overall pleased with the purchase.

3.5,"not a lot of complexity here - it’s very much a straight rye. spicy. hot. not a lot going on, wish they’d used less of their young distillate. an ehhh value for the $$ I paid, but wouldn’t pay that again."

2.75,It’s ok. Not much depth to it. A soft rye nose. Very short finish. A little rye spice. I get earthy tones to it. Maybe the farm is playing tricks on my palate. I would pass on this one.
4.0,Really fun to sample these over the last 3 years. Love this one. Young but tasty. Lots of wood but in a good way. Stash away one bottle every year. What's the over under on 100% VT?
3.75,"Unique flavor, a little hot"
3.5,"Smooth is the word with this limited release.  Very balanced with a eunique flavor profile.  It doesn't drink like a typical rye.  There is a bit of back of the mouth heat on the finish, but no real spice or cinnamon.  The grassy barn like flavors are definitely there but not enough to make it a negative.  It almost has an American Malt flavor to it.  It is strange because I do not care for American Malt, but I really like this.  It is pricey, but all of the WP offerings seem to be.  Strange as it seems, I like this better than the WP 10yr.  This limited expression will not last long so get a taste while you can."
4.25,"Very unique tasting. Nose is like wheat or barley in a field. Very earthy, and slight sweet and tangy taste to it"
3.0,"Its intersting to say the least. Packs a punch on the nose that I cant explain as anything else but spunky...definitely young. Taste reminds me of an odd mix of hay, mud, and livestock but not in an awful way. I like the 002 better (definitely a different taste), never had an opportunity to try the 001. Very pricey for what it is and would NOT purchase again at ~$75"
