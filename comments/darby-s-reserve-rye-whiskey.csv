1.0,"This isn't Rye.  It's bourbon.  It ain't horrible, and it ain't good.

You can drink it.  But it IS NOT RYE in style nor flavor."

3.0,"I have enjoyed this Rye much in the past, as have many friends. I knocked it down in my ranking after learning that it underwent 
    fake, simulated, accelerated ""TerrePURE"" aging, and is just 2 months old otherwise. However, it's very different from any other rye, and good if you are in the mood for an extremely sweet, mellow rye (especially if pairing with a somewhat sweet meal). I usually prefer over even George Dickel Rye when looking for that, though Willett 3yr Rye and High West Double Rye are better ryes in general which also pair well with a sweet meal, and Knob Creek Rye and Colonel EH Taylor Rye (when you can find it) are much better ryes in general (if not sweet). My 2nd favorite of 50 whiskeys - George Dickel Hand Selected Barrel (9yr, 103 proof) is the best sweet Bourbon / Tenseness whiskey which pairs well with absolutely everything, and is a much better bet if that is what you are looking for, though not a rye. It's certainly one of the best deals in ryes, and better than typical MGP/LDI/Indiana sourced ryes from Bulleit, Russell's Reserve, and even George Dickel."
1.0,Tobacco flavor. Not smooth straight up.
