4.5,"Nose- Earthy peat, ash, vegetal, moss, green grape

Palate- honey initially, wave of spice, then that same earthy peat note, red wine influence, salt

Finish- Long, spicy finish with notes of earthy peat, pepper, and red grapes 

This one is good, not fantastic, and certainly not my favorite bunna, but good. Nose has moss, earth and peat, with not much else (with water, green grapes and some stewed fruits developed). The palate has many layers, which I do like alot. Sweet to spice to peat to sweet and back to earthy peat again. Really develops in the mouth and is truly complex. I would grab a couple other peated whiskies before this (octomore, Lagavulin), but I believe this would stand toe to toe with 95% of the peated whiskies out there."

5.0,"Incredible. Peated just enough to enjoy without overpowering the other flavors, of which there are many. Chocolate, cherries. Finish is long and smooth. This is near perfect. Smoke lingers on top of the fruit. Doesn’t give any hints of it’s higher proof"
5.0,"One more whisky worth calling out from Saturday’s Whisky Show in London was this new limited release from Bunnahabhain. It wasn’t on the pour list but I managed to negotiate a discrete sample from a bottle hidden under the counter. It was matured entirely in Bordeux wine casks for almost 10 years. Dark chocolate, cassis sauce, dark maple syrup, candied cherries — it’s one of those luscious dessert drams. Recommended if you can find it."

3.5,"Very honey like on the nose and also cream, really can taste the cask strength but the wine is really interesting and possibly works"
4.25,"Very full-bodied, and similarly spicy and aggressive as the 21-year old Palo Cortado.  Clearly aged in a Bordeaux cask, it’s lovely and rounded with a pleasant level of smoke.  58% though, so if you’re not expecting cask-strength, might want to have a bit of water handy."
4.75,"Incredible.  Such a great nose, and elegant finish. Just the right amount of peat. One of my favorite whiskeys of all time."

3.75,"I had the opportunity to reassess this at home and see how it stood up to my initial impression at The Whisky Show. My more considered opinion is that is indeed very good, but not as great as my initial review and Felipe’s imply. In color and viscosity, it pours like engine oil. The nose brings to mind a tawny port, with an undertone of mulch and burnt match, but it’s not as bold as I would expect given the cask strength. In the mouth, it starts sweet, peppery and oily, before the flavors coalesce into cherries covered in dark chocolate. The oiliness coats the mouth to leave a long and spicy finish with notes of dark chocolate nibs and a hint of mint. You’ll definitely want more than one glass of this if you get the opportunity but I think the nose would have to be more compelling for me to firmly recommend you track down a bottle."
