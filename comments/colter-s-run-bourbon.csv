3.5,"From the western side of the Grand Tetons, the quieter side of that magnificent range, comes Colter's Run Small Batch Bourbon Whiskey, a wonderful offering from Grand Tetons Distillery located on Highway 33 just outside Driggs, Idaho.  Colter’s Run is a limited edition bourbon made in small batches at GTD; the bottle I brought home from our vacation in late 2018 sports the old bottle label and was Barrel #12-GT-31, Bottle #222. While the bourbon may have only been aged three years, it’s relatively smooth for a younger bourbon, with a great balance of oak and vanilla that finishes with some nice baking spice tastes."

2.0,"Rather harsh, almost bitter flavor."
2.0,"I had a sample of this last week in Jackson Hole, when I was trying to figure out if I should buy a small bottle (375ml) of Wyoming Whiskey or this one.  I chose the Wyoming.  Which, by the way, I had maybe once and then forgot in the cabin before leaving for Yellowstone.  Anyway...this one is worthwhile if you truly love oaky, woody taste.  it's smooth, just too woody for me.  I'm not sure if any more time in the oak will help it any, might just make it more woody.   I'm guessing it was probably intended as a mixer."
