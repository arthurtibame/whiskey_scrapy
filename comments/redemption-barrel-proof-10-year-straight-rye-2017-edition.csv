4.25,"Late FRyeday Review and it's a good one! This is the Redemption 10 yr Barrel Proof Rye Batch 2 (95/5 MGP sourced)... It's not often these days that you can find a Whiskey that's excellent, available and arguably undervalued.... And that's exactly what we have here! Let's dive in... 

Upon entry it's viscous and really mouthcoating.. initial notes are toffee and dried dark fruits with some leather in there as well... As you get to the mid palate leather and oak kick in with a dash of pepper and rye spice... finish is lengthy filled with spice, caramel that dark fruit note and oak lingers! Any rye lover I think would really appreciate this one a lot. 

For comparison I have recently sampled a Willett 10 yr and the Old Carter Rye Batch 1 (both also MGP sourced) and I have to say I prefer this over both of those. 

Cheers All!"

2.25,Earthy. Strong ethanol smell. Long legs
3.25,"Nose - (w/o water) Spicy hot cinnamon nose, dark vanilla caramel, toasted toffee, light black pepper & herbal notes, hint of oaky leather (w/ water) Greatly reduced heat/burn, oaky vanilla, charred cinnamon, not as sweet smelling, dark vanilla caramels, charred herb stems

Taste - (w/o water) Tannic/oaky hot cinnamon heat/tingle, sweet vanilla, light oaky bitterness, spicy cinnamon caramels, light dry herbal sweet (w/ water) Still tannic/dry, charred cinnamon sticks, leather, light vanilla caramel sweetness, spicy cinnamon heat

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering dry/tannic oaky heat, bitter charred cinnamon, oaky vanilla simple (w/ water) Lingering tingle, slightly less bitter, oaky charred cinnamon, vanilla caramels, oaked simple.

Score - 71/100

Final Thoughts - This was hot right out of the bat. The nose was oaky ethanol heat & that lingered to the taste & finish too. This tasted like a slightly overoaked overproof rye to me. It didn't seem to pick up many complexities of a fruity sweet or herbal notes I get in other ryes. This was straight up charred cinnamon, leather, with hints of vanilla caramels. I don't think this one was very well balanced and I think it was a bit overoaked for only being 10 years of age.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
5.0,What happened to all those GREAT SAOS Barrel Proof Ryes!? These guys got em and jacked up the price... fortunately they’re still 1/3 of what SAOS goes for on the secondary...
4.5,Great whiskey. Full body and very smooth for a rye. Lots of fruit with sweetness and earthy spice.
