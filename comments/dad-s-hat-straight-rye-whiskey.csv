2.5,"I didn’t enjoy this at first, but it grew on me a little and then was embarrassed to see it so highly rated by experts. A nose of sweat and body odor, just like you’d expect from a whiskey called Dad’s Hat. But the finish is smooth for a whiskey, so I have to give them that."

3.5,"I like it fine. My palate has been refined toward bourbon, so tasting a traditional rye is a different experience. As such, I'm not used to the spicy, almost minty kick of this rye, but it's still pretty tasty on the finish. I can taste the cedar/woody flavor and the heat on the finish is strong but surprisingly enjoyable.

For now, I rate it somewhat high but need to dive into some more rye offerings to see how it measures up. But it's tasty and, I think, worth the cost."

3.0,"This one has been a bit ambiguous for me. The bottle says ""rye,"" the initial nose has tones you'd find in a Speyside scotch and the flavor profile is like nothing I've ever tasted. It took 4 drams before I gained an appreciation for it.  Some might think that's a bit much and I might be inclined to agree. If you're used to Canadian Ryes, this one might not be your bag. 

This one makes you work for it (finding the spice and the enjoyment) and although that might be fun for the adventure of it, it's not that great if you're looking for a reliable, enjoyable and spicy rye.
