1.75,"Urgh...here we go again. I was not a fan of the 18 year old and so the meme around ""the key to happiness being low expectations....lower... nope even lower...ah there you go..."" sadly doesn't even hold true here.  If you like musty bitter acetone this distillery is right up your alley. I usually like funky whiskey but I found my limit with this distillery. Its foul but it ticks some peoples boxes. Even worse I drank it as I thought I had to too complete my tour and then as soon as I tasted it realised I'd been through this pain before, looked up my notes and found the 18. It goes by the name Loch Lomond or Inchmurrin or sometimes both... that's my excuse anyhow. Even worse I see I have a 12 year sample gleefully waiting to make me want to puke...but it's organic so it MUST be good. To quote George Bush ""Fool me once shame on me, fool me twice shame on me again,"" or words to that effect. I will not be fooled a third time....but I'll probably suffer the experience to post a review so others have fair warning cos that's the type of nice guy I am :-). 1.75 because you have to celebrate a 21st even if its shite."
