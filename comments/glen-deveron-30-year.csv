5.0,"Excellent dram, smooth and flavourful

Complex but yet delicious

5/5"
3.5,"Ok full disclosure. Drinking this after a flight of 10 to 25% higher abv quality bourbans was perhaps folly in terms of an objective rating. Still an average rating (prior to mine) of 4.7 is highly outrageous. It's got character for a blend...more than nice or pleasantness but still that's it's backbone. Light toffee, honey, green apple (a first for me - I think - but after reading taste descriptors given my mild descriptive ageusia i was like yeah apple). Hmmm....3.5 max I'm thinking and if it had a fighting chance maybe higher but I have to call it on the night. VFM (at well over $300 USD a bottle) suggests 3 but fairness given my muted taste buds says round up so distiller gets a 4 star. But then I wouldn't buy or drink my way through a bottle. So back to 3 to balance things out it is."

5.0,"10/10.   Wonderfully smooth, excellent flavors, and smooth."
5.0,"At first, the nose smells notes of vanilla and hay. Then, when you let it slip inside your mouth, there is a leathery blend of nutmeg, cinnamon and sherry. You can also find a hint of citrus flavour. The final is malty with a remnant of spices. Overall really good tasting experience!"
