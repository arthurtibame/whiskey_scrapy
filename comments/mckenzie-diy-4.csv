4.25,"The color is a very rich amber and with a swirl it clings to the class and stays there. It is an interesting mashbill of 65% corn, 13% spelt, 11% wheat, 6% wheat malt and 5% barely malt. On the nose it is somewhat earthy and chocolatey, with oak, vanilla custard and hints of lemon zest and caramel, along with a salty meatiness that comes out as it breathes. The palate is full of vanilla and oak with dark chocolate and rich custard following, creating a rich mouthfeel. Baking spices follow along with pepper and a spiciness that is reminiscent of rye. The finish of medium long with a lingering vanilla and spicy oak, with fading baking spices. The unique mashbill makes it difficult to pinpoint what each grain is contributing, but it comes together in a brilliant way. 

Aftersniff:

This aftersniff is an experience. Remnants of salmon cling to the nostrils. Subtle hints of hamster bedding ruminate throughout. The post-aftersniff is similar to a warm apple pie that your dog knocked off the table on a frenzy. It makes your tastebuds scream, “slap my britches and call me pappy!”

Not bad, but unexpected."
