90 proof

Nose: Cloves, vanilla, oak, peppermint, Tangerine, caramel (with air time).

Palate: Orange marmalade, cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla, peppermint, with a touch of lemon.

Finish:  Oily with fading peppermint. 

Primarily a spice and fruit driven palate with a few candied  notes.  

It was a little of a disappointment because I had a wonderful Single Barrel sample (from a different barrel) a few weeks prior to working through this bottle.  

While it was a bit of a let down, it was decent.  It also highlights the difference’s between single barrels.  While I would not purchase a bottle again from this particular barrel, I would definitely try another."
