5.0,I have the batch 1 and it is amazing.  The tasting notes however seem ver different.   I little bird tell me batch 1 was sourced and produced differently than batch 2.  I'd love know if that was a valid bit of info.

4.0,Unique flavor for a bourbon - the advertised cognac taste is prominant. Hits the front of the tongue unlike other bourbon. Very sweet and fruity for a bourbon.

3.0,Lot of sweet flavors happening initially. Finishes a bit harsh (which I like) but not necessarily in the right way. Wouldn't purchase it again but it's a solid 3.
4.0,"Butterscotch, apricot, blackberries, grapes, toffee. So tasty and unique. Want a side-by-side with Angel’s Envy."

3.75,"Nose - sweet with mild floral notes, high proof on the nose 

Taste - Sweet and rich, medium bite 

Aftertaste - Smooth, little bit of heat going down that can be fixed with a small cube"

2.0,"Smells hot, youthful and sweet. Opens with a punch of spice and oak, lingers and the oak rolls around the tongue. A tin like aftertaste develops from the oak. Clove and vanilla are in there, but nothing complex about this one. Needs more time to develop, much better bourbons out there for the price."

3.0,"Overcast Sunday.  Have the smoker working it’s magic on ribs and corn. Mac ‘n cheese in the oven.  Beatles playing on the stereo.  Countdown to “Sharknado 6” begins. Now I sit and wait and realize it’s a perfect time for a bourbon.  This is a local Long Island whiskey that is sourced and aged in oak barrels (of course) and finished in French oak casks that previously held Long Island Chardonnay which was “rinsed in high proof brandy.”

[Batch 19] Distinctive bourbon notes of corn and vanilla start the nose.  Red grape notes start working its way though as it opens.  Toffee with some rye spice follow, seeping through the opening aromas.  As these aromas blend and weave, carnival treats of buttered popcorn and peanuts manifests themselves along with stone fruits (cherry and peach). A surprisingly busy nose. 

The mouthfeel is medium-light which arrives sweet and spicy.  Brown sugar, vanilla, butterscotch with a rye graininess. Towards the finish, grape and peanut butter and corn oil as it fades towards the finish. 

The finish is slightly drying with some char, oak, rye and dill.  Some black pepper and grape notes encase the char and pepper.  

I didn’t expect much from this bourbon and was caught off guard that it was an enjoyable sipper.  The wine finishing definitely rounds the sharpness that would reveal itself otherwise.  A good middle of the road whisky that is inoffensive and easy (for a Sunday afternoon) while smoking meats.   [85/100][$29][Tasted: 8/19/18]"
3.0,"The first of many bonus samples from this last round of the SDT comes by way of tour member @Scott_E in the form of Rough Rider Straight Bourbon Whisky out of Long Island, NY. Bottled at 45% ABV and is natural color of amber gold and is most likely chill filtered. 

The nose has distinct notes of red and Concord grapes, peanut brittle and charred oak. Very sweet with the corn notes coming into focus after a few minutes. The wine notes are very much in the foreground at all times. A bit of a cotton candy flavor and faint rye notes, but without any of the dill notes typically associated with rye. Some musty cardboard but not too bad and a quick hit of cherry wood. Grape candy, banana, and at the bottom of the glass there is some potpourri. 

The palate is straight up peanut butter and jelly on rye. Wow is that weird. It’s a good weird though, quite unique from anything I’ve ever had in the past. A little charred oak and toffee with vanilla. The corn notes are punched way back and the spice from the rye is more dominant with some banana rounding things out. 

A medium light bodied mouthfeel that’s a bit thin but decent. 
The finish is medium length with peanuts, oak, rye that turns slightly metallic and a bit floral. 

With a name like Rough Rider I was expecting some a little, well, rougher. Quite amazing how strong the PB&J notes were. Not great as far as bourbons go, but it’s unique profile continued to hold my attention. This is a 3 star dram, but the sheer oddity of the PB&J profile bumps it up to a 3.25
Cheers"
3.0,"This was an extra from @Scott_E, as a part of our final round of scotch samples.  This straight bourbon is made on Long Island and bottled at 45% ABV.  It’s polished gold and makes thin legs and somewhat large, running droplets on the tasting glass.

The nose is fresh oak and light corn with underlying notes of cardboard.  There’s no indication of alcohol at all.  The palate was lightly rye spiced with some toasted banana and sweet corn.  Typical young bourbon stuff.  The finish was short and watery, but not hot at all.

Overall, it’s a typical bourbon that was neither impressive nor offensive.  It would work fine in your favorite cocktail and a great way to support local distillers.  Thanks for the pour, Scott.  2.5 stars.  Cheers."
4.0,Bitey at first but a smooth finish

2.0,"Jesus...my 3rd attempt in trying to a review...really hating these new updates.  Wondering why these updates were needed?  Anyway...trying one last time...else will call it quits for the day...this here is a sample from my friend @Scott_E as part of our final round.  A locally made bourbon from Long Island.  I’m a huge fan of craft distilleries, it’s a pure blood, sweat and tears effort. Some are great and make it big (Westland).  Others are one man shops that need some ways to go (Deerhammer).  This falls in the latter category.  Nothing special, decent...but I’d not pay over $25.  $10 more, and you can do better. $10 less, and you can still do better if walk over to the wine aisle."

3.5,"Another offering out of NY. Like Widow Jane, I'm fairly certain that this one is sourced from MGP. It's a high-rye bourbon aged in Chardonnay Casks rinsed with brandy, all for a very reasonable price. Batch 32.

Nose: Very dry and oaky. Leather, black pepper, clove, nutmeg, and allspice. Plum, grape, raisin, and black cherry. Some cocoa, butterscotch, almond, orange and grapefruit citrus, brown sugar, and caramel. It's oak forward with some spice and background sweetness. In fact, the it's far less sweet than a standard bourbon. Interesting.

Palate: Once again, oak is front and center. Plenty of spice: black pepper, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, allspice. Apple, caramel, cocoa, brown sugar, and vanilla. Almond, macadamia, and chestnut. Black licorice. Oak, spice, and nuttiness. Sweetness is detectable but tempered.

Finish: No surprises here. Medium length. Oak and all the same spices (black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice). A bit of plum, raisin, black cherry presents itself briefly before the spice tingle dissipates. 

This is a solid value at $30 flat. The unique cask-finish choice pays off, especially on the nose. The palate could be better; it's structurally similar to the nose but devoid of all the really unique and notes I picked out in the aroma. The finish delivers a fine conclusion to this dram.

I'm keeping my eye on this one. I'd like to see what they can do with their own distillate. I can see myself buying this from time to time. Solid entry-level bourbon. As long as you don't expect any more from it, it's well worth the money."

3.5,"Nose: Corn, heavy malt, apples, maple syrup, grape, oak, citrus, dense molasses / chocolate.

Taste: peanut butter, rye, caramel, molasses, syrupy after taste, dense oak. Grape sweetness is there but its actually rather weak but dense at the same time. Its heavily taken over by the oak and caramel, but when you do taste it its dense almost sour. Almost like a dense, unsweetened jam than a jelly. Water brings out some brown sugar, cinnamon, apples and cherry but otherwise dulls everything down."
