2.0,"My first real attempt at trying scotch. With two ice cubes, it initially presented a complex flavor that was somewhat enjoyable. But as the ice melted a little, it began to be more harsh, with a kind of sweet, yet Band-Aid type of flavor."

1.0,"I've only tried one Lowlander previously...which was an amazing Rosebank.  I fell in love with it...it was light, fruity, citrusy, and yet layers of complexity.  But, it was EXPENSIVE.  So...I wanted to try another Lowlander...and I purchased this one, for a fraction of the Rosebank cost.  Huge mistake.  The aroma is not too different than what you'd get when you take that first whiff of a hospital room.  Ah yes....gotta love that camphor smell.  The taste is even worse.  It then goes downhill...the finish is unfortunately really long, which is not a positive in this case.  This is pure torture.  One more sip of this sewage and I'll probably go blind.  On the bright side...I just found a new antiseptic for when my daughter gets soccer burns."

3.0,Avg but not horrible. Prefer over Dewar’s but not something I’d actively buy again

2.0,"Nose: sweet, sugary like, some fruit, floral notes but I can’t place what it is, sitting will open up a hint of a cinnamon note, not overly complicated. Taste: thin, sweetness on the frontside, fruit, transitions to spice like ginger, finish isn’t anything complex either. A bit disappointed in this one."
