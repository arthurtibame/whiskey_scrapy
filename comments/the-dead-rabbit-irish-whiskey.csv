4.0,"Happy Friday!

After hearing the Whiskey Cast episode where they interviewed the folks behind the Dead Rabbit, I was intrigued... especially since I don’t drink Irish whiskey, generally finding it too mild for my preference. 

Here are my notes:

Dead Rabbit
Aged 5 years, 88 proof, Debut release
3/1/18
Nose:
Big cereal grain and freshly cracked barley malt. Underneath the veil of barley lies freshly toasted oak. 
This smells like a particularly malty Speyside if it were aged in new American oak.
The scent is straightforward, but not lacking in complexity, just deeply barley, and deeply oak.
As it breathes, I find white grape must.
Taste:
Oh so thick! On the palate, it floats like honey or B grade maple syrup. 
It definitely has a clean flavor at its core, as most Irish whiskies do, and if it didn't have anything else, the great velvety texture with a hint of heat would support it just fine.
However, the big oak presence is there; 
It's woody, like fresh pencils, new limbs, and seasoned log piles; 
It's spicy, like flame-charred jalepeno peppers, spicy, with a toasty bitter skin, and green soft berry beneath.
Though it gives great texture and viscosity, the barrel finishing also gives a touch of sweetness.
With just abit of time, that buttery Chardonnay flavor blooms forth... all of a sudden, this dram has something going on!
Finish:
Husky barley flavors dwell, as the footstools of tongue-smacking oak tannin, a dab of puckering oak tartness, and a heavy laquer of that oak barrel sugar that leaves your palate still feeling silky, but just dusted with white peppercorn and mace.
Overall:
OK, you got me. I found an Irish whiskey I like and would drink!
This is like a fair American whiskey and a mild Highland single malt had a lovechild and it somehow came out Irish."
3.0,"Okay. A bit harsh, and not especially exciting, but to be fair had just tasted two whistle pig ryes"

4.0,Very complex deep woody vanilla notes balenced by a peppery taste.

4.0,"Punchy, oak dominant. A bit of vanilla. Very good for a more aggressive Irish whiskey."
5.0,Like a bizarre cross-breed between a smooth and fruity Irish whiskey and a vanilla-rich Kentucky bourbon. Do I detect some mild smokiness too?
3.0,"It was fine, probably like a 3.9. Very standard irish whiskey"

3.5,"Here's what I know about The Dead Rabbit :

• a mix of Malt and Grain in the ratio of 30% Malt and 70% Grain.
• The Malt Component: is 100% Malted Barley and put through Pot Stills
• The Grain Component: is a mix of Barley and Maize (corn) through Continuous Distillation Column Stills
• Fermentation times are typically between 58-66 hours.
• Maturated for 5 years in ex-Bourbon Casks and then finished in 1/2 Size Virgin American Oak.

The 1/2 size Virgin American Oak casks are what many companies commonly refer to as Quarter Casks. They're generally about 100-125 litres, half the size of typical bourbon casks (about 200 litres), and a quarter of the size of typical sherry butts (about 475-500 litres).

Tasting Notes

• Nose (undiluted): very oak forward, plenty of sweet malty notes, and lots of vanilla and toffee punching through, spices like cinnamon and cardamom, perhaps a touch of green apple in the background
• Palate (undiluted): gentle arrival, then getting very bourbon-esque and a bit punchy (in a good way), loads of toasted oak, cinnamon, and vanilla
• Finish: medium length, honey, oak, vanilla, a bit of buttery croissant flavour near the end, which is pleasantly drying.

With water and a bit of time, the nose becomes apple pie! Lots of baked honeycrisp apples, cinnamon and some rich, dark toffee. The palate loses some punch with water, and the finish is a bit less oaky. So adding water is going to be a personal choice; the nose is better with water, but the palate and finish are better neat. Of course, it may be time and not water that changed the nose. I had a 50 ml sample, and I tried it twice, 25 ml at a time, about 2 weeks apart.

This is an unapologetic, oak-forward whiskey. I can see The Dead Rabbit polarizing whiskey drinkers. If you're looking for a sherry-bomb this isn't the whiskey you're looking for. But if you're looking for a whiskey that tastes...like whiskey, this may be for you. I enjoy this type of flavour profile. The Dead Rabbit is oak-driven without making you feel like you're gnawing on a table. The pleasant, drying finish is exactly what I want in this type of whiskey. The Dead Rabbit is great on its own, but I can also picture a bottle of this whiskey on my table at a Saint Patrick's day gathering, poured into rocks tumblers and sipped - responsibly, of course - alongside a pint of Guinness or Kilkenny. Recommended. (84/100 points)"

2.25,"A surprising Irish indeed. On the nose it it has all of the classic smells of honey and sugar cookie with the added vanilla of a bourbon. Upon tasting the punch of charred oak hits right away and lingers throughout though sweetness starts to come through at the end with vanilla and a little caramel. Unique for sure but sadly not Irish enough for when I'm wanting one and, of course, not anywhere near a good bourbon. Not sure how often I would be in the mood for something that kind of floats between the two."

4.0,"Above average Irish whiskey and it's cheap. Spicy, with burnt roasted veg and oak followed by a distinct dark chocolate finish. The chocolate comes across most prominently. What a treat to have a uniquely flavored Irish for under forty bucks."
