5.0,"Spectacular! I could not heap a sufficient amount of praise for this expression even if I wanted to, and if you can get your hands on the bottle, it's worth just about any (reasonable) price. 

That sherry, oak and baking spices are really strong on the nose. On the palate it's woodsy and sugary, with a syrupy and almost granular texture on the tongue; it's a mouthfeel that is more akin to an expensive cognac. A wow factor. Also notes of ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, dried fruits, and the whole damned pantry!

It's one of the all-time best!"
