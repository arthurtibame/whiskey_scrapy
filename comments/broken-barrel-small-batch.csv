4.0,"The whiskey is sourced. So if you're a whiskey snob, that may turn you off. The sourced whiskey is only 1 year old before it is given to the finisher.

Nose: fruit cocktail. Cherries from a cherry pie.

Pallette: Lots of influence from the Oloroso staves. French apple pie.

Finish: Long lasting. Port wine.

Though it technically is a bourbon... This is a poor man's Redbreast 12 year. I really want to do a blind taste test between the two. This is a value whiskey. By value I don't mean cheaply made. I mean it is awesome for the price. You cannot tell that it's young."
