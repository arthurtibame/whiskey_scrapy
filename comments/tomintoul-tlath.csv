3.0,Definitely gentle as the namesake implies. It’s a bit sweeter that I typically like and I find it a bit one dimensional. The flavor profile is nice but it falls off quickly and has a bit of an absent finish.

3.0,Nice vanilla & oak nose. Soft oak flavor. Oak & nutty finish. Thanks Bob.
3.5,For the price this is a decent Scotch (got it for $25 at Specs in Houston).  Not sure what the tasting notes are - will have to buy again.  But I felt it was a reasonable liquor for the price.
3.25,"A NAS from Tomintoul, it is pleasant enough displaying notes of malt, honey, biscuit or pie crust and a bit of spice and a waxy mouthfeel.  There is no peat or sherry or cognac, just the basic malt.  I find no fault in that.  What I do fault is this tends to be over priced, running $40-45 per bottle.  I found mine on sale for $20, similar to Speyburn Bradan Orach.   If you can get it for a price near that, it is a good deal. However, in the $40-45 price range there are several 10-12 year old single malts out there that give a superior value."
2.5,"Jeune, fruité et sweet"
3.5,"Young & oaky, like a young oak."

2.0,"Un Speyside floral et sec.
Décevant en bouche, ne vient pas me chercher, reste très plat. Peu aromatique, juste alcoolisé.
La finale est mieux, mais dans l'ensemble un whisky très moyen"
