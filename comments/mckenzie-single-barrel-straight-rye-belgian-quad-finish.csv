4.25,"Limited release from a barrel share between Finger Lakes Distillery and Two Goats Brewing.  Two Goats aged a Belgian Quad in rye barrels, then the McKenzie Straight Rye whiskey was aged in the rye/Belgian quad barrel.

Nose is honey, rye spice, and fresh raspberries.

Taste is spice, raspberry jam, barley wine syrupy sweetness, and oak.

Finish is smooth for the 97 proof and had a lingering spice.

This is a wonderful finish to a rye whiskey that adds a ton of fruit and an interesting sweetness."
