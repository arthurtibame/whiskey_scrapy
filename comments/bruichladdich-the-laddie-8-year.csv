3.0,"Meh.  Forgettable.  I picked it up on a recent travel...should've used my luggage space for something else.  This really needs maybe two more years in the cask.  Oh wait.  They have that don't they? It's the Laddie 10.   I sort of feel these travel ""exclusives"" are a test ground to,see what works and what doesn't to do a global roll out.  This one isn't bad, it's just not good either."

3.0,Zingy combination of spice and alcohol heat makes for a bit of an angry toddler... needs a drop of water to calm it down. Opens up nicely with subtle vanilla and tropical fruit. Hints of sock drawer and toast give balance to the youthful exuberance. Can't give half stars but it's a solid 3.5 from me.

3.0,"Color is pale yellow. On the nose barley, fruit, some citrus notes. Pallet is rather shallow, with oaky tones mingled with light fruit. Finish is short with some bitter notes, nuts, and oak. A few drops of water makes it somewhat smoother, but cannot fix the immaturity of this whisky. Seems like it has an excellent potential, but 8 years is not enough to reveal it. Overall not a bad drink, but definitely lacks complexity of more mature drams."

1.75,"I bought this whisky on a duty free bacause I really like the regular Classic Laddie and was almost sure I would like this one as well. It wasn't cheap at USD 75,00 and the expectations were high.

For this review, as always, I poured myself a dram (arrrghhh...), and into the tasting notes: On the nose it first is quite closed, after sitting for some minutes on the glass or adding some water I can pick some acid sweetness that reminds me of fresh green grapes juice and lots of salt. Not the more inviting nose but you don't have the slightest idea of what awaits you... On the palate, DAMMIT!, the palate... Do I really have to go on with this??? Well, you'll barely feel anything because your taste buds will be anesthetized from the alcohol burn and the GIANT peppery note... But I'm brave and tried again, of course this time adding water until I almost drown the whisky. Still the peppery note is there upfront, but a little tamed and the alcohol has gone, I can feel something else, the green grape note I felt on the nose is there, is like in a white wine, but one you dropped some Tabasco and rubbing alcohol inside... As much as the finish concerns... Who knows? I have already spitted it a long time ago! \o/

To resume the whole review in two words: STAY AWAY!

A two star review because believe it or not I have drunk worse."

3.75,"Pale yellow in colour.  Smells of vanilla Madeira cake.  Can smell light smoke notes on the nose

Initial taste fizzed on tongue, but after that it was thin and warming.  Fruity and floral and easy to drink

Enjoyable and good for the collection."

4.0,"Surprisingly close to the Laddie Ten in likeability, with a zestier lemony nose and punchier mouthful. Great with a cube of ice."
4.0,nose is nice but there is too much oak in the palate
