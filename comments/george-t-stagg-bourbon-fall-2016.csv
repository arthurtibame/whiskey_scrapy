3.0,"Hot, hot, hot. I hate having to add water to whiskey, and I realize that's a me thing. But dear god, this is liquid fire."
3.0,"Goodness gracious you gotta let this breathe! Even after breathing for a while it still requires a lot of digging under a big whiff of medicinal alcohol. There is mint oil, delicate toffee, cocoa powder, and browned butter. The palate is primarily hot and minty.  The finish is very dry due to a large amount of wood tannin. Adding water softens and lengthens the wood notes. Despite the tannin and alcohol the texture is fairly juicy. Overall, the alcohol has too tight a grip on this whiskey and it has no intention of letting go."

5.0,144 ABV! Blew my damn pants off. Add water. Then add some more. Every bit as good as I'd hoped.

4.5,"MB: BT #1. Aged 15 years. #4 barrel char. (Sazerac-Buffalo Trace) It has to be watered down, but this is a wonderful whiskey, and smells, immediately after opening it, like a Tootsie roll on a bed of brown sugar."

5.0,"25/02/2017. MOM sample. 
            Nose -- maple 🍁,  mint oil, creme brulee, muscovado sugar, burnt caramel. 
            Palette -- roller-coaster. Sweet --> mint --> wood --> dry.
        Not an everyday drinker. Small quantities. Needs watering. After watering, becomes more rounded, rich hot toffee and some star anise"

4.0,"The waiter brought a side glass of ice to go with this, which inspired nothing but skepticism in me initially; I LOVE my firewater. But yes, all the reviews on this are correct - a drop or two of water is required to get the full effect, even as smooth as it is neat. Goes from ""having a solid wood piano dropped on you from a height"" to ""same piano being played bombastically and expertly across your tongue."""

4.0,"Mooched a dram from a friend at a recent birthday celebration. 

I genuinely enjoyed this. As someone who enjoys Stagg Jr. neat this naturally was delicious to me and one of the more interesting bourbons I have had the pleasure of tasting.

Oak, dry red fruit, spices (distinguishable from the alcohol), cherry, and more oak. I unfortuately did not add any water to see the flavor profile mellow as I was quite content with this full bore. 

I would happily purchase if I somehow found one sitting under a pile of dust in a store.

5.0,"Belated.

Neat.  Glencairn.  Dark chocolate brown color.  Medium to heavy body.  Legs very slow to form.  Dominant chocolate covered cherries on the nose, with a creamy frosted flake background.  Vanilla and obvious ethanol, but not a huge singe.

On the palate, again dominant cherry syrup and milk chocolate with chili pepper.  Bitter orange rind.  Sweet corn and vanilla.  The proof tingles the entire mouth, but it is complementary and highlights the chili pepper.  Just an incredible burst of flavor that is a treat to savor."
