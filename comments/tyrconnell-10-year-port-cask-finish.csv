3.0,"Visual:  In the glass it is a light amber color/pale gold color. Thin, but lasting legs after a swirl.

Nose:  Initially hot, with an assertive aroma of red apples accompanied by something like magic marker. After some rest, the heat diminishes, along with the marker smell. The apple aroma persists, and is joined by crème brulee with fresh berries, but a little lighter on the vanilla than a typical crème brulee. Some fruity port wine essence sneaks in, as well, not surprising given the final maturation. Interestingly, the ex-bourbon barrels don’t lend much other than the faint vanilla in the crème brulee. My guess is they aren’t first fill ex-bourbon barrels.

Palate: The initial flavor is sweet honey and hay, followed by a definite malty graininess and strong cereal grain flavor mid-palate.  There is some definite heat throughout the tasting experience, indicative of the 46% ABV – it perhaps reads more like >50% ABV.

Finish:  The finish is fairly long, with continued and briefly growing, then slowly diminishing heat. The grain and malt continue, and are joined by the slightest hint of coffee, as well as a nuttiness. The expert notes on Distiller describe the finish as having an almond flavor. I don’t know that I’d get any more specific than to just suggest that the finish is nutty. 

Empty glass:  Mixed nuts and brown sugar.

Thus far in my somewhat limited experience with Irish whiskeys (which is about to get more robust, as I’ve acquired several MoM samples), I haven’t been bowled over. However, this one gets my attention. It seems more characterful than some I’ve had – perhaps owing to two distillations as opposed to three, as well as the port cask finish. I would give this dram four stars if it weren’t for the heat, which I thought was excessive for its ABV. In the absence of a half-star option, I’m giving it three stars."
4.0,"Looks like I'm two for two in enjoying ten-year-old Tyrconnells - this is pretty good stuff, although the finish is a little off compared to the nose and palate. You get a good dose of wood notes without the typical accompanying wood spices, and the nose is wonderfully unusual: hazelnut, honey and raspberry jam. There's even the faintest of floral notes. It's all quite complex, until you reach the finish and encounter a bitterness that's difficult to ignore and set aside. And worse, it lingers. Still, good whiskey."
4.0,I do taste a hint of peach. Mellow

3.0,I do prefer a Pot Still to this but appreciate that the Irish can make a decent Scotch?!?! Still though a lovely whiskey. We toasted to my old man the day we laid him to rest with this. There are a couple ounces left in the bottle that will remain there for him. He was a gentleman in the truest sense of the word. 89/100. $99.95 cad

4.0,Nice. Sweet. Fun. Who doesn't love a port-aged whiskey. The port casks mellow the buttery richness of the single malt into a relaxing finish enjoyed best by the fire.
