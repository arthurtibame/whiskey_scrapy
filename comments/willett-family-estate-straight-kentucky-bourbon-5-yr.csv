4.0,Bartender recommended. Thought it was solid. Need to put willett on my radar and find some bottles.
4.25,"being familiar with the willett ryes, the taste is somewhat similar, which is a good thing.  without the licorice/rye notes in the flavor, the initial strong palate sweetness covers the mouth. the 120+ proof doesn't get in the way of the great finish."
