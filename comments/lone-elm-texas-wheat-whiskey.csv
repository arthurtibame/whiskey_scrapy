4.5,Good vanilla flavor with strong fruit flavor and chocolate. This is a 100% wheat mashbill. Very good. One of my favorites and they are beginning to create new mash bills. Can't wait to see what they create next.

4.75,"Had a newer bottling of this - 4 year old, Single Barrel. High rating because it is the best wheat whiskey I have come across, way better than the next one on the list."
