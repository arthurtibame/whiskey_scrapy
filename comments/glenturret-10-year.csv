2.0,"On the nose, mainly sweet, honey, with very very light fruit (lemon) and floral notes in the background. Not a lot going on on the taste, again the sweetness dominates, with a very unbalanced, strange finish. After you swallow the first sip, something doesn't match with the nose and taste experience, but in a bad way. A taste that I couldn't identify speaks louder than the rest, making this whisky a poor choice."

3.0,"Glenturret 2002: Sweet nose, maple syrup, French toast. Starts off pretty good but the finish is only so-so. 

Tasted at the Royal McGregor on 7/22/2016"
3.0,"Note: this was the Glenturret 2002 (not the 10 yr)
Part of the flight at Royal Mcgregor.
Something in the nose told me that I wouldn't love this one. Thought it was solid up until the finish. Which was overly sweet."
