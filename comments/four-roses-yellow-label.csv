3.0,"The corn nose leads me to smelling bananas. I like bananas but not banana flavored anything. However, this does not give me banana taste and it is a fantastic treat that is well worth the price. 36 doll-hairs ($) for a 1.75 liter.... what else can I say. Well worth trying for most bourbon lovers, it’s light, sweet, and smooth. Great bargain. The rep as a gateway bourbon is accurate. 3.1/5"

3.0,"Nose: slightly balsamic honey, sweet spices - very reminiscent of certain modern takes on Oriental perfumes (Camel by Zoologist comes to mind)
Palate: classic bourbon, with sweet corn and honey
Finish: not very long, mostly oak
It's not an amazing bourbon, but it's fine - an honest working horse. At that price point you'd be hard-pressed to ask for more. Very good in most bourbon cocktails."

2.75,"Four Roses Yellow is the entry level expression in the FR line, and it shows.

Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn.  Nose is lightly sweet, with some vanilla and bright citrus poking through.  Palate starts lightly sweet also with more vanilla notes being overpowered by ethanol. Light and short spiciness.  Finish is short and underwhelming, some barrel wood comes in but needs more.  Just very underwhelming and uninspired.

Overall not too bad for under $20.  Would make a good cheap mixer but as a sipper spend another $10 gets you a much nicer pour, or better yet another $3 gets you Wild Turkey 101 which clobbers this one in flavor.  And if you really just need a mixer, Evan Williams Black or 1783 is better and cheaper.  If you really want to experience the goodness of Four Roses please step up to the small batch variety or single barrel.  It’s a night and day quality difference in that and their yellow label.  Cheers!"

2.0,"Taking a quick break from the SDT to get in a bourbon review. I had to do it now because this bottle of Four Roses Yellow Label disappeared faster than any other bottle I’ve owned, simply for the fact that it was $20 and I bought it to drink over ice during gigs. With roughly 2 oz. left in the bottle I figured it’s now or never (or until I buy another bottle). 

Yellow Label is a NAS Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey that is bottled at 40% ABV, is natural color of amber gold and is chill filtered. 

The nose is harsh at first, even at 40%, but it mellows fairly quickly. Lots of oak, perhaps a bit too much. Cinnamon,  clove and spicy ginger. Apples, mint, dill, rye, corn and a bit of anise or licorice, but it’s faint either way. Something reminiscent of raw cookie dough, vanilla and brown sugar. A hint of bubblegum after a while. 

The palate has a strong oak presence like the nose. Vanilla, toffee and light cinnamon. Light corn, rye and dill. Barrel char, roasted apple chips some pepper, and a distant banana note. Not much complexity here. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel, a little astringent and dry. 
The finish is medium long with oak, vanilla, slightly metallic and dry. 

Good for only $20, but this was meant to be used as a mixer, or at the very least over ice. Drinking neat isn’t exactly a bad experience, but neither is it very enjoyable. Not nearly as complex as it’s more expensive brethren. I’d put this close to or on par with Evan Williams Black Label. 2.5-2.75
Cheers"

sips the above came together. Drank neat @ room temp. This was the first tasting ever based on reviews and more ways are still to be tried (ice, mixed, etc). Nifty bottle."

Palate: Wood is what hits first, little hint of spice, as well as a sweet vanilla hitting the center of my tongue. A very agreeable bourbon. 

Finish: Apple peel is what I get for a flavor in the finish, with little burn going down and a pretty quick finish.  

Overall: Drinks up to its price point, but not so sure it’s a sleeper you’ll be shocked by. I’m glad I have a bottle."

Citrus and nutmeg up front, with more classic vanilla notes hanging around in the back.

I would call this a little better than Jim Beam or Maker's Mark but in the same lane, which is squarely in the middle of the road."

3.0,"I certainly did not expect much from a bourbon at this price point and may not have been eager to try it had it not been for the positive reviews and recommendations I had come across. That said, I was aware that because of the combination of mash bills and yeast strains used, there was likely not to be any standout flavors and smells for this dram and went in with moderate expectations. I put a generous neat pour into a Glencairn glass and gave it a spin. The first smell was noticeably tinged with alcohol, but continuing to inhale revealed a floral base with fruity undertones and mint. The first sip provided a light, dry mouthfeel and as expected did not spotlight any distinct flavors. On the way down, light spice and woody oak give way to a short but pleasant finish. After the first sip, I went back for a sniff that displayed new hints of vanilla and caramel. There was certainly nothing unpleasant about the Yellow Label, but it definitely was not a standout. I would likely not regularly choose it as a sipping whiskey, but it would be great in cocktails, especially anything with ginger beer. Probably not a ""must-have"" bottle, but certainly one of the best things at this price."

3.0,"The nose is loaded with sweet corn with lighter notes of honey, vanilla, and an oak note that comes off as a chocolate ""ding"". The rye doesn't jump out the glass when nosing but is more prevalent on the palate. The palate has more heavy corn sweetness, mixed in with spicy rye notes that show up with the vanilla and the light oak. The longer you sit on this the spicier it gets and the more complex the sweetness becomes. It eventually develops into a mild light brown sugar sweetness with a constant hovering oak note. I usually get a floral note in four roses products but at 80 proof it does not jump out the glass like in other offerings."

3.5,"Sweet corn and a tad hot with a touch of acetone and some vanilla. Not really much barrel char here. That’s not a bad thing. Good entry level bourbon to try with ice or as a mixer. If going neat, try adding a teaspoon of something smoky to your dram such as Talisker 10 and it’s something else entirely. It transforms this or any less sophisticated whisky for that matter to a new beverage category. The rough edges disappear and it’s a new frontier. Cheers, my friends."

P - warm leather - light spice 
Finish - leather again- spice and light floral- warm but short. Light 
Solid bourbon for the $$. Ok straight - delicious for cocktails- but light on proof"

3.75,Just straight classic bourbon. I’ve had much better I’ve had much worse. For $22 I’d come back to this a time or two.  Easy to drink neat or on the rocks.
2.25,Falls off quickly and doesnt hold flavor
3.0,Great for someone who is new to bourbon.
null,"Flowery, smooth and refreshing. This matches well with sweet chocolate."
4.25,"Super Smooth and Sweet. Solid bourbon that’s a little shallow on Flavor and has a quick finish with no burn. If you’re trying to ease someone into Bourbon, this is the perfect starter Bourbon"

3.0,"Nothing to write home about, but nothing to scoff at either. 

Four Roses’ other bottlings are far superior, but I bought this to make old fashioneds, and it delivers exactly what I expected. High-rye, smooth and eminently drinkable."
