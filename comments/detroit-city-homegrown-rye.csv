3.75,"Belated.  Abbreviated notes:

Very sweet, some bubblegum.  Hint of spearmint.  Again impressed for the young craft whiskey, slightly less so than for the bourbon."
1.5,"Not as grainy as I expected from the mash bill. Full body, but turpentiney finish, likely due to its young age. Reminds me of other Midwestern local distilleries, Koval and Few. Overall impression, there are better ryes for the price."

4.25,Really mild up front with a warm spice to follow. Rather nice and good straight up.

3.5,It’s a bit bitter for all the notes you read to expect on a rock is better than neat
2.75,"A bit hot but some good flavors too. Vanilla, cherry, and oak being the most prevalent."
