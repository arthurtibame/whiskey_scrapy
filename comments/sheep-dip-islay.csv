2.5,"Nose: wood varnish, cherries.
Palate: malt, botanicals,, smoke, honey, and a hint of cinnamon. The peat is there too, but not in your face.
Water: adds a seawater scent and helps even out the flavors in the palate a bit.
Overall: fairly complex but the flavor notes all over the map and aren’t necessary complementary."
