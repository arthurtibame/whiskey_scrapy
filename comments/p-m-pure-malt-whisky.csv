2.5,"November 25th 2018 at the Alibi Room in Vancouver.
A 1 oz serving in a Glencairn glass. 
Very pleasant, but not very complex compared to scotch whiskey. The predominant nose and palate is of vanilla and caramel. There are some wood barrel notes as well, but not a complex whiskey by any means."
