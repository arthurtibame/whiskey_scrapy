3.0,"Won't find much on the nose with this. Floral and fruit comes out if you pay close attention. 

Woody and ground grain hit the palate if you give them a chance. Otherwise you will find a stiff, plain man's whiskey. Fresh lumber -and acrid burn. Nice for sitting out on the patio with a whittling knife and listening to the neighbor'a ducks. Slightly oily and spicy. Carved Hannah's ewe with this. 

Spent a Saturday with these guys a couple years ago - like these guys a lot. Maturity will do their whiskey many favors."
3.0,"The nose is full of spice, almost too powerful as you bring the glass up. The whiskey itself is very abrupt in flavor. Spices are the first thing that stand out, sweeter undertones come to life as you chew it. For me the spice is strong, even excessive at times. It is good, but not for me."

3.0,"Floral nose, subtle cedar and sage. Sweet, vanilla, holding the cedar and florals, and adding a spicy complexity that holds into the finish."
3.0,"This whiskey has a sweet nose that is reminiscent of red licorice.  The palate is all juicy red fruits (cherries in particular) and the finish is spicy and biting.  Not a bad little whiskey and I think it would work great in cocktails, where the more abrasive spicy edges would stand out to great effect."

3.0,"Light nose, but the glass was not tulip shaped. It was spicy, and letting it linger a second brought out some floral notes with a fairly light finish. Adding a drop or two of water revealed some nutty notes."

Will be back with more notes."
1.0,"Had a bottle while on a fishing trip to Lake Erie.  Wow, the burn started fast and did not subside.  My two fishing partners did not like it either.
Added some water, tried on the rocks, mixed with lemonade.  Nothing seemed to help... I dont think I will be drinking the rest of the bottle, its taking  up space.  very disappointing."

2.0,A bit of burn on the palette that stays with you. This is listed in the 101 whiskeys to try before you die. It is very different and unique. Glad I tried it but I don't really like it.
