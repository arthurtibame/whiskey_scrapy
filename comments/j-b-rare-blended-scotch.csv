null,"Very smokey, you get that right from the start with the peppery nose. Tastes just like it smells. Plain except for the horrendous, fume like taste. A cheap, entry level blend. Supposedly it's marketed as a mixer in Europe. After tasting it, you can surmise as to why that is. The aesthetics of the bottle and the label (it's been in countless movies and books) are probably worth more to me than the actual scotch inside the bottle."

2.0,"J&B Rare is a low-cost Blended Scotch of rather insufficient quality. The nose is sweet and fruity with a pervasive and unpleasantly dominating toffee note. Although said to be slightly peaty, I couldn't detect that. Drunk neat, the youthful harshness of the spirit turns into indistinct and sweet spiciness. There is a metallic aftertaste, and the grain whisky is doing an awful lot of work in this blend. Mixed with Coca Cola, the dominant toffee does not harmonize with the sweetness of the drink. To sum up, I did not enjoy J&B Rare - neither neat, nor as a mixer.

1.0,"I did have a very good bottling of this a couple years ago which surprised me and almost won me over.  But never again since.   this is my 3rd try.  The current bottle I have is barely drinkable with ice.   Tastes of prune, oversteeped tea, vanilla,  and pencil eraser but with a nice peat note although more subtle than that other bottle.  There is some vanilla and pleasant flavor in the finish but the arrival just completely ruins it.   I'd honestly prefer a bland canadian blend over this because even though it lacks the added flavor, the Canadian whiskies don't taste awful.   This is very bad to me.  I can't imagine this is what Dean Martin was drinking..."

1.5,"This is the first of a series of reviews I'm doing of a dozen affordable blended scotch whiskies.

Nose: An initial ethanol and malt profile with some light honey, faint vanilla, and fruity notes. The fruit is somewhat citrus but best described as like the aroma of tinned fruit salad.

Palate: A hot alcohol arrival with some accompanying metallic spice. This develops into a malty sweetness.

Finish: Short as can be. The malty sweetness from the palate turns bittersweet and slightly metallic at the end.

This is a very spirit-driven and grain-heavy blend with a thin and somewhat distant character. I’d wager that the malt content in this blend is quite low. It’s not actually unpleasant but there is so little going on with which you can engage that it’s not worth drinking neat.

I did not detect any peatiness or smoke during tasting, but you can smell faint smoke on the dry glass, so it is there as a foundation - but it might just be the burnt metal note some young column-still grain whisky seems to have.

As a mixer it is serviceable, if rather bland, but I wouldn't bother because at the price there are better blends. In some respects it is similar to modern Teacher's Highland Cream, but thankfully it avoids the bitter/sour character of that blend.

  ""Adequate"" : 1.5 star"

2.0,"You get what you pay for with this stuff. It's not terrible though. It's drinkable and, surprisingly, goes down fairly smooth neat. I can really only justify 2.25 stars for this one; however, I will add that it is one of the better bottom shelf blends I've tried. If you're on a budget and you just want to get from point A to point B, consider grabbing a bottle of J&B."

It has a citrousy aroma, and a grainy taste and nothing more . Maybe it will work on some cocktails, but still I can find better stuff at the same price."

J&B Rare was Estd in 1749 per the bottle.  This is the first Scotch I've tested/reviewed and is as I recall Scotchs to be... bitter, earthy, and of flavored to me taste. If there taste was like the smell...
I am sorry that I am not able to get me arms around Scotch... but I'll keep trying when there is an opportunity.
This was better with a ton of ice...

2.0,"Color: The color for this blended scotch is a light straw yellow. And its legs are pretty thin.

Nose: On the nose I find the slightest trace of smoke, as well as citrusy lemon and shortbread cookie notes.

Taste: On the palate I find lemon and cherry notes, as well as sweet butterscotch and sugar cookies.

Finish: The finish is short to medium and has a slight burn but rounds it out with an almost cinnamon sugar aftertaste.

Thoughts: So this blend is old and has a lot of history. I think that's really cool, but as far as the scotch goes, by itself it's pretty boring. As a cheap mixer scotch, I'd pick this all day. But drank neat, it is pleasant, but it doesn't have much depth. If it was offered to me though, I would not refuse. Sláinte!"

Very light. Nothing offensive. Then a bit of alcohol burn. Nothing special, but nothing offensive."
0.25,"Worst whisky I've ever tasted.

It's harsh on the palette, with notes of acetone. There isn't much to taste except for some floral notes.

The aftertaste tastes as if you've vomited. Pure vomit. Don't waste your money on this. Even Johnnie Walker Red Label is 100x better than this.

If you want a decent blended Scotch for the money, go for Chivas Regal."

3.0,"There's a special breed of pest lurking around both Social Media, and video sharing sites like YouTube. This nuisance views himself as knowing better than the bottlers what their Whisky is good for. So when J&B makes it clear they're a mixing Scotch, Mr. Know-it-all says  whiskys should 'stand on their own,' and a Mixer should be able to be a Sipper. 
Then this 'genius' takes a $20 bottle of J&B,  pours it into a Glencairn, and starts talking about how it's subpar as a sipping whisky. Then he touts another Whisky, almost always a Single Malt, as being a better deal. It's only a few dollars more, he says. Does he try the J&B mixed? GOD FORBID, NO. He says he's got some cheap Bourbon on hand, when he wants to mix. He's educating us! You see, you didn't know Bourbon was interchangeable with Scotch, did you? 
If you're an informed consumer, you don't need a hype man to tell you what to drink, or how to drink it. Take what the pests say with a fistful of salt! J&B is a very good Shooting/Mixing Scotch."

4.0,"If something sells, as much as J&B do, its because it cant be bad. So i grabbed a mini bottle to finally taste this... and even if it has only the classic flavors from a blended scotch, it is actually good. 

Bottled at 40%abv with a pale gold color.

On the nose, classic blended scotch aroma, but in a powerful way: vanilla, cream, caramel, almonds and some dry brown grasses.

On the palate very straightforward and simple, but in a pleasant way: caramel, pepper, prunes, oranges and a hot medium finish. 

Overall this one is a solid 80 over a 100, cheap than everything else, so if you are feeling like grabbing something to drink without much spending this one is the way to go. Cheers."

3.25,"Over the last weekend, I had a chance to try J&B Scotch and I was not upset with it. I am still looking for a few good scotches to keep in my bar and while I have found Glenmorangie 10yr I am looking for others. This scotch is not bad and while I can taste a touch of the smokiness it does not overpower it. If this is an introductory blend then I believe it succeeds. I had one glass over ice and I made a scotch and soda with the second glass and both were very easy to sip and both were enjoyable to me. The first glass was a bit rough at the start with the sharpness of the scotch jumping right out at the beginning, but as it mixed with the ice the sharpness mellowed and the sweetness and softer smoke/peat? ( I am not sure of the taste of peat I do not have a lot to compare with it.) The Highball was very nice I made a lite highball with 1 oz of J&B to 3 oz of soda water and that is a refreshing drink. The sweetness seems to come out more and the smokiness is muted and on a hot day, that would be a great drink. All I like J&B it is not overpowering and not too smokey for me. Enjoy."
