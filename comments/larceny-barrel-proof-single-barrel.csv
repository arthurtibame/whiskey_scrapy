3.75,"57.7%, Barrel 5652486, although it doesn't state Single Barrel.  Larceny is a high wheat mash Bourbon, and even at Barrel Proof the nose is mild.  A bit of heat on the finish, and lacking in flavor and complexity.  I can see why this lingers on shelves. There are much better Bourbons around this proof that cost much less, and are better.  This needs more aging.  My score was 76"

4.75,"Single barrel picked for the 2018 Kentucky Bourbon Affair tasted at a bottle share.

My impression was entirely favorable.  Deep, rich liquid toffee.  Good viscocity and low burn.  Wish I could find a bottle.  I'd buy it in a heartbeat"

2.75,Good whiskey for a wheated whiskey.  Get a little cinnamon on the nose with cinnamon and peanuts on the palate with a good little burn at the end

4.25,Love the flavor on this. Subtle sweetness on the end leaves you wanting more
3.0,"Nose: Cinnamon and peaches 

Palate: Spicy.  A bit “thin” for my tastes. Not a ton of flavor.  A more experienced taster could probably pick up on flavor profile, but not this rookie.

Finish:  Burns (in a good way) to the end.  

Overall - not my choice for a daily sipper, but I’m not a huge fan of wheat whiskeys. I think this would make an excellent mixer - will try in a Manhattan soon."

4.0,Sweet smelling. Rich oily feel. Strong alcohol burn and wonderful spicy finish. Great value for the money. I highly recommend.
