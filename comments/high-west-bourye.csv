5.0,"My current favorite suggested by our local whiskey purveyor. I'm glad I took his suggestion!  The nose is sweet yet oakey but in my opinion does not do justice to the taste. Vanilla, caramel with some well balanced astringent and wood. LOVELY stuff. Sweeter than I would have guessed but that is by no means a bad thing. I have added this to my top shelf. Smooth, woody medium-long finish. Great find!"

5.0,"This has been out of stock for a couple of years in Salt Lake, but recently came back....at 80$ a bottle! I liked Son of Bourye well enough but wanted to give this a go.  I must say, it ranks right up with my favorite (Rendezvous Rye) from High west.  I'm not a huge scotch fan, but this has a perfect blend of a scoth flavor and rye together.  I have to say, very surprised.  Also, never buying because of the price."

4.0,"This is like a really smooth, welcoming rye.  The bourbon definitely adds a roundness that results in one of the more interesting pours I've had in awhile.  I would not hesitate to invest in a bottle."

4.0,"Nose - Sweet vanilla, butterscotch, sweet corn, brown sugar simple syrup, faint hint of sweet mint.
Taste - Spiced dark chocolate, dark caramel, cinnamon spice, cracked black pepper, an herbaly sweet mint, very stubtle dill and a very buttery mouthfeel.
Finish - Lingering warmth of cinnamon spice, turns lightly bitter like if you were trying to strip the bark off of a young green tree branch.

3.0,"All the High West blends play like a finely-tuned orchestra, and this one is no different. The bourbon and rye flavors are distinct on the nose and the tongue, yet neither one overpowers the other. There's creamy corn on the front foot, followed by a crescendo of spicy rye. If you like both its components, it's hard to imagine a better blend of the two. I'm not a bourbon fan, however, so I'll mark this below the High West ryes."

3.0,I had this in Park City so enjoyed the experience but was not wowed by the whiskey.
4.0,"A really clever blended whiskey from High West that sort of plays like an American version of a blended scotch.  To follow through with the conceit, think of the aged rye playing the role of the single malt, providing some complex spice notes on the finish.  Meanwhile, the younger bourbon acts as the sweet grain whiskey backbone and contributes a pleasingly mellow palate.  Some nice wood notes on the nose.  As I said, a very clever ""blended bourbon"" from the folks at High West."

This is awesome stuff. Worth the $89 I spent on it. Nice nose and I love the layers of flavor. Butterscotch into oak into spice with a touch of sweet."
5.0,"Delicious.  Great blend of sweet and spice.  Nice, smooth finish.  Another quality whiskey from HW"

3.0,Starts smooth with mostly sweet notes in nose and taste. Rye takes over on backend and spice lingers strongly on the finish. A really interesting and fun whiskey that I would like to spend some more time with.

4.0,"Batch 16A08 (so, probably the 2016 release). Initially alcohol sting on the nose. Seems like the rye is stronger at this stage. Floral notes and some apple and vanilla. Baked apple pie. On the palate, the apple pie notes continue. Smooth caramel, cinnamon, apples, and vanilla ice cream. Spice and pleasant bitterness linger, and a surprising amount of warmth going down. Some bubblegum in the aftertaste. Delicious. 7/8/17"

5.0,HW blending MGPI sourced bourbon and rye. Well done but pricey. Spicy grassy rye dominates after fruit opening.
