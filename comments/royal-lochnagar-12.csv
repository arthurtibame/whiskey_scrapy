3.0,The nose immediately brought to mind holiday fruitcake and rumballs.  The palate was overwhelmingly covered with pepper with a clear and fresh finish with a hint of sandalwood.  Adding water changed the nose to pine wood and brought out a buttery carmel palate with an apricot finish.

3.0,"A slight smoky note that may come from the rejuvenation of the barrels as well as a certain floral/herbal smell on the nose. There is a certain sour note, bordering on green apple, and an oatmeal like malt sweetness. A warm, but abrupt finish. A nice introductory single malt, IMHO."

3.0,"Royal Lochnagar's most famous expression actually isn't its single malt.  It's a large part of Johnnie Walker Blue Label, to which it lends its sweet and floral Highland base.  The distillery itself has a cool backstory, which the name reveals in part.  In the 1840s, the distillery owner invited his neighbors -- Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who owned a nearby castle -- to sample his wares.  The royal family enjoyed the whisky so much that they gave it a rare royal warrant, an honor accorded to only a few distilleries to my knowledge.  I believe that Royal Brackla is the only other one that has Royal in the name.  Laphroaig, which is Prince Charles's favorite, has a warrant from him, although I'm not sure if that's technically a royal warrant, as he isn't king (certainly the distillery hasn't named itself Royal Laphroaig, which would be hilarious).  Anyways, Royal Lochnagar 12 is mostly found in the UK, not in the States, and I'd describe it as an unexceptional Highland single malt.  The most unique note that I can remember is a papaya-like flavor on the palate, which gave it a refreshing tropical character."

3.0,"It has been a while since I tried this, but I remember it as an unobtrusive whisky. I neither loved it nor hated it. It was fruity and a bit herbal, with no real peat on the nose or palate. It had a slightly watery texture, but not bad. The finish was short and sweet. I actually bought this for a German Professor, who I was told was retiring. As he was the keynote speaker at a conference I organised, I presented it to him after his talk. I went on and on about his dedication to the field, his tireless efforts, blah, blah. He smiled a bit nervously through my speech. He then very nicely announced that I had been misinformed and he wasn't retiring. That evening he opened the Royal Lochnagar, we all had a good laugh and got pissed. Thank god I didn't buy something more expensive."

2.5,"I didn’t have high expectations for this bottle, but was pleasantly surprised. It has the backbone of a nice highland malt. I think it is really let down by its presentations. Everything was too quiet, too muted. 
On the nose was honey, heather, and orchard fruit. Palate was about the same. And the finish, well what finish?  
Royal Lochnagar would be a thoroughly ideal conversation whisky if it was $50 CAD. Unfortunately, it goes for more than double that where I live. If this was a higher ABV, maybe un-chill filtered it would be enjoyable. A competent whisky, but extremely overpriced for its presentation."

2.75,"Fruit, and a strong sense of caramel on the nose. Quite a nice aroma honestly. Spicy and oak on the palate, but that's it. Not very sophisticated in its flavour profile, and the finish is non-existent. Somewhat disappointing considering how lovely the nose was"

Nose: woody, pungent, spicy, 
Palate: mild spicy
Finish: salty

Overall: few flavor layers, not good"
3.0,"Pleasant and fruity, but a complete ripoff at $130 CAD - pretty sure they had elevated levels of alcohol in their bloodstream when they decided this price point. 

Nose and palate have notes of apple (with prominently) and honeycomb. The body and finish are disgracefully flat and short, with floral notes towards the end. 

Taste but do not buy at that price."
3.5,"I see this one has been extensively reviewed by the mob on their tour of scotland so little to add. I like it, decent drop. 3.5, not quite a 4 as slightly bitter finish but given the price at under $50USD I'll round up."
3.25,"So, what have we got here? The smallest distillery of Diageo's portfolio, a royal warrant dating back to 1848, and one of the key contributors to JW Blue Label. The nose starts off with cloudy apple juice, fruit salad and maltiness before hints of caramel and sawdust creep in. More apples follow on the palate (apple puree and pie), and there is a delicate touch of oak, ginger and cloves. Easy, short but without any off-notes, the finish does not leave much of an impression. With that being said, I would still prefer Royal Lochnagar 12 over JW Blue Label at any time.

3.0,"Time to catch up on Distiller reviews today! Nice nose right off the bat. There is more sweetness in there than lighter whisky, a lot like the Dalwhinnie 15. I sense floral properties, like jasmine, but more fruit like white grapes, pears, and cherries. The palate is more floral forward than expected, and this balances out the sweetness. The buttery/concord grape medium length finish is welcomed, but I'll knock it for the coloring, and possible chill filtering and a low ABV. It does not taste mild at least. 3.5. A summer sippin' dram that could be easily paired with food. The theme should be  ""Vacation"" by the Go-Gos. Thanks so much for the sample Pranay!"
3.0,"Finished the week. Hanging in there on my March Madness pools. The weather is still cold (ugh!).  Time to pour this sample provided @PBMichiganWolverine. I have never had a Royal Lochnager before nor have I ever seen one on any shelf.  I am not sure what to expect. 

Straight up:  the nose is heather, honey, floral, apricots, coconut, marshmallows, orange marmalade. A touch pinch of cinnamon spice harkens in the depths. 

A light honey-tea sweetness arrives first on the palate.  As the sweetness subsides, dashes of white pepper spice and peat bring the next wave of flavors. Orange and apricots lurk about faintly.  This is all wrapped in a medium-light body.

What’s left is a drying palate with bitter orange and ginger root with a touch of char.  A warming soul sensation keeps a nice comfy feeling on this cold winter evening. 

This is not an overly complex dram, but it does deliver some good nose and flavor. Not balanced in a ying-yang way, but in a linear way.  If this is a $45 to $50 whisky, this a good pour (don’t know the cost).  Worthy of a try. [85/100][Tasted: 3/16/18]"
3.0,"Here’s another sample from the team effort:  (Royal) Lochnagar 12 Year.  This is a highland distillery that was awarded a royal warrant from the U.K. royal family that made them the official distillery for the royals for a term of 5 years.  I’m not exactly sure who decides this determination, how often it happens, what it brings the distillery/royal family/regular Brit citizens or what the big deal is.  It’s a British thing, us ‘Muricans just don’t understand.  

This one is bottled at the minimum standard of 40% ABV, is light copper in color, appears quite oily but it doesn’t make many legs in the glass.

The nose is very fruity, almost artificially so, with oranges and some blackberry jam.  There’s an underlying note of tea leaves as well- which doesn’t sit well with me.  I was forced to drink so much tea as a kid (no sodas) that I actually can’t stand even the smell of tea as an adult.

The palate was again very fruity- orange slices, pears with lots of honey sweetness.  There was a nice vanilla creme candies flavor that arrived mid-sip.  The lack of barrel notes made this a seriously fruity and overly sweet dram, though.  It needs some oak or heat to balance it.  Sadly, it’s just not there.

The finish is medium in length, turning somewhat dry and leaving those darn tea leaf notes on the tongue.  Or perhaps, this was just stuck in my head- I don’t know lol.  It was this final statement that turned this pour negative for me.  It’s all because of my dislike of tea, though.  

Overall, I think this would be a decent beginner’s dram for those looking to ease into scotch.  The lack of heat and oak will make an experienced drinker probably think less of this one.  Me?  Well, I can’t handle the tea leaf aspect.  I have to rate this one pretty low because of that fact.  Thanks to my friend @PBMichiganWolverine for providing this one, but it’s just not for me.  I hate to give it a crashing score, so I’ll just rate it middle of the road and move on."

3.0,"Stop number 70 on the SDT is Royal Lochnagar. Lochnagar was the first distillery to ever receive a Royal warrant, which basically means it was the first to provide scotch to the Royal Palace, and thus granted the title “Royal” Lochnagar. 

This 12 year old Highland single malt is bottled at 40% ABV and is chill filtered and has colorant added making it an amber color. 

Fresh stone fruits on the nose. Apricots and red plums. Oranges, tangerines and marmalade.  Melons, strawberries , blackberries and a touch of vanilla. A light but elegant oak. Typical Highland profile so far. Floral honey, light mint and herbs. A little nutmeg and ginger. Strong notes for only 40%. A sherry sweetness with maple syrup and some cherries forms after a while. The faintest trace of wood smoke and a strange aromatic note I can’t quite place. Not bad at all. 

The palate echoes the nose with the apricots and tangerines. Honey, herbal tea and light oak. Licorice, ginger and light vanilla. Not a very complex palate, but that’s not always a bad thing. 

A medium-light bodied mouthfeel, mouth coating, a little creamy and dry. 
The finish is medium length, very dry with apricots, oak and herbal tea. 

A strong flavor profile given the low ABV which brings to mind the Cragganmore 12 year old. I know that one is from Speyside, but it’s also at 40% and has strong flavors. A really nice and fruity nose, but the palate and finish fall a little short. For around $50 it’s a pretty good value, but there are better bottles out there. Would have been a 3.75 were it not for the very dry finish and the shortcomings of the palate. So a 3.5 it is. Thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for the sample. 
Cheers"
3.0,"This was my sample offering as we start round 5 of our Scottish distillery trading team.  About 2 more rounds to go, and we’ll be wrapping up this brilliant journey concocted by @LeeEvolved.  Lochnagar, or officially Royal Lachnagar, is interesting in the sense that there’s nothing exceptional or worthy remembering about it except that it somehow got itself a Royal warrant.  Which in essence is a title given by the king and /or queen for their favorite distillery for 5 years. So that means that for a period of 5 years, Lochnagar was the provider of whisky to the royal family.  A huge financial windfall.  It doesn’t have to be whisky, but can be any product.  The key is that it would be the provider of that product’s brand to royalty.   It’s been given to Aston Martin, Cadbury, and Twinings tea.  Lochnager was given the title by Victoria and Albert, being so close to their Balmoral home.  And so there you have it...an interesting ( albeit utterly freakin useless) lesson on granting Royal warrants.  Now to the whisky tasting:  it’s meh.  Decent.  If I’m ever born into the Royal family, not sure this is where I’d grant a warrant (for me, it would be Springbank).  But to each his/her own...whatever floated Queen Vicki and King Al’s boat."

3.5,"Not bad, but the start of the taste is rather bland, mild, but the body is bit sour, even if I like Highland ones, this is not the taste profile I'm looking for."

3.0,Not bad on ice. No significant flavor profile.
3.0,"Nose: Initially the nose is spritzy and very like apple cider with lots of orchard notes (pears and red apple skins). Over time, as it rests in the glass, grassy and cereal notes emerge together with some vanilla, a little oak and soft honey. Overall it brings to mind the smell of freshly baked apple pies, with grain being harvested in the distance. [The dry-glass aroma is cereal/fruity and very slightly smoky]

Palate: Sweet, creamy arrival with a mild dusty malt note. Lots of sweet apples in the development (again, rather like apple cider) and a touch of very soft ginger spice. There are further orchard fruit and nutty flavours as it progresses and the texture is slightly creamy with the faintest taste of smoke.

Finish: Medium/short. Fruity/sweet and fading into an aftertaste of weak black tea and golden syrup.

A straightforward, unassuming malt that makes up for a lack of complexity by virtue of its disarming approachability.

When it used to be available, the Royal Lochnagar Distiller's Edition was my whisky of choice for introducing novices to scotch single malt or as the first malt in a tasting flight. This is not as good as that expression, but it is still arguably superior as a starter than the usual choices of Glenfiddich 12 or Glenmorangie Original.

At the price it is reasonable value as an everyday dram. Along with Strathisla 12 it is also one of my favourite nightcap drams when I'm in the mood for something particularly sweet, easy and relaxing.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

4.25,"This one quite surprised me. I thought it was going to be one of those Diageo's mediocre 12yo malt expressions, but actually it was very good. When the game of thrones expressions came out, the one from this distillery was going up in prices like crazy so i got the impression they had something good, but then i read some reviews about this whisky and the reactions were mixed. Had to try for myself, this are my notes:

Bottled at 40%abv 

On the nose, it is almost perfect, that is why this whisky has a good score: Cherries, Caramel; the most beautifuo vanilla aroma i have ever encountered on a dram. sugar, Lemon, Oranges, Apricot, Peach and Cinnamon. Very nice.

On the palate, things are enough good to deserve some points, but it is not as near as good as the nose was. Peaches, apples and Vanilla. That's it.

Aftertaste has a sider / apple note. A lovely and clean fruity finish. 

Overall this dram is a solid 86 over 100, due to its amazing aroma. It can be so much better in the palate, but stills manages to pass the exam."
