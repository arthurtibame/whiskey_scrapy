5.0,"Brown sugar, vanilla, caramel...classic flavors, mild heat with smooth medium finish."
3.0,"Very sweet corn & vanilla nose... Almost reminds me of a sugar cookie. Soft and slightly oily mouth feel with more sweet corn alcohol. Finish is more sweetness. I get no rye spice on the finish... Slight cinnamon spice and a little young green woodiness. Probably wouldn't hold up well in a cocktail, but a decent table bottle."

2.5,Just okay. Could be better with a higher proof. The flavors are a bit muted in my opinion.

3.0,I like this Bourbon. I can’t get it in Ohio often so when I can get it I pick it up
3.0,"Mash bill of 68% corn, 20% wheat, and 12% malted barley. Distilled by the Old Fitzgerald Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky and is part of the Heaven Hill Distilleries. The color is a deep golden brown with smell of sweet corn, vanilla, and oak. A taste of sweet caramel with some char and vanilla. A finish of oak and syrup."
3.5,"Light. Not complex but easy, enjoyable drinker at an unbelievably great price if you can find it"
2.75,"Distinctive Heaven Hill (particularly Old Fitz BiB) baking spices, with caramel and vanilla. Slight burn. Quick wood finish. Nothing great, but also inexpensive."

3.0,"One of the Christmas 2018 bourbons.

Can't really remember adding Dec note in February."
5.0,"My sample is from the 1960s, and the nose starts of with oak upfront with spearmint and cherry syrup behind it, followed by vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and toffee. The palate has sweet oak mixed with baking spices that are stronger on cinnamon, along with butterscotch, vanilla, caramel and brown sugar, with a touch of cocoa powder rounding it out. The finish is long and oaky with baking spices that fade to lingering brown sugar and vanilla. Truly incredible."

2.5,Young smelling nose of mostly alcohol and corn. Sweet palate with very little flavor.
2.75,"Wanted to like this, but it was just ok. Should have expected this because of the dirt bottom price."
2.5,"The cheapest bourbon I have bought.  19.99 for a 1.75l.  Only bought for the name and cause I haven’t seen one.  Actually not terrible for the price, way better than rebel yell (and cheaper) but not near Evan Williams single barrel (19.99)"
4.0,So far my favorite of the bottom shelf KY bourbons. So delicious and well balanced.
1.0,Tastes like a watered down whiskey that didn't taste great to begin with.

3.5,Nose is simple with vanilla and smooth spices. Tasting is predominantly of walnut with a hint of vanilla. For the cost it's fairly deliscious.
