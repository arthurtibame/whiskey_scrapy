3.0,"Sometimes it's nice to taste something different and unexpectedly unpretentious. Despite the use of kitschy phrases like ""bespoke barrels"" and ""rare earth"" on the label, the Straight Rye Whiskey from Fremont Mischief Distillery is brash, bold, and quite good. This whiskey shows up to the dance with a bit of a flash (people starting looking it up and down), then it makes a scene, a few flashy dances, maybe drop kicks someone in the face (jaws drop), then twirls around before slowly exiting as everyone is staring in disbelief.
Yes, it will not appeal to everyone and people may dislike it's antics, but it definitely puts on a show and doesn't hide the fact that it is unapologetically rye.
Rye bread on the nose, raw dough, a bit of vanilla, and buttered popcorn. On the palate you get kicked in the face with yeast, spice, black pepper, and charred oak. The finish is fairly thin but with pleasant heat and black pepper and some biscuit goodness."

3.5,Sweet and spicy. Not the smoothest whiskey but decent.
3.5,"Middle of the road, spicy tail. Nothing really jumps out, but there's minimal burn. Enjoyable, lighter than most ryes I've tried"
4.0,Added water but surprised I liked it. Reminds me of rum but difficult to taste properly without water.
2.0,It’s ok. Sweet honey taste. Needs a lot of water to loosen it up. Wound very tight.
