2.25,"A generous taste courtesy of Pie Chef Guy. This bottle is a Total Wines store pick.

The nose starts off with fresh piña colada, strong coconut and a sweet touch of caramelized whip cream (flambé anyone?). It does smell great, but after that, it gets strange.

The taste is very sharp. Coconut lotion, medicinal bandage, salt and nylon. It's like chewing on a band-aid from a pool used by elderly body builders.

This whiskey kind of goes down like a well oiled bike pump.

What on earth did I just drink?"

3.75,Had two bottles from different distributors. One was exceptionally good and the other less so. Nice and intense expression like all Kavalan.
4.0,Recommend added a bit of water. Less alcohol bite and you get much more vanilla and fruitiness. Very enjoyable
