3.5,"Slightly fruity on the nose. Bitter, citrus, grassy flavor. No fire in the throat. Mild aftertaste."
2.5,"Nose has hints of apricot and other light fruits among the rye.
Sweet, floral and fruity front with some char notes on the palate.  
Perfume tones among cobwebs and flaked rye. 
Not impressive but not garbage"

0.75,"50ml poured neat into Glencairn at home.  Bottle proclaims this was ""AGED 12 MONTHS"" with the ""12"" accentuated in an almost comically misleading way.  Nose is full of hay, grass, dust, spent rye.  Lack of age really showing here.  Taste is more of the same, with an unpleasant thin rye bite.  Cardboard and kerosene immediately come to mind.  Thin, grassy, really unpleasant.  Total fail, frankly doubt that actually aging this for an appreciable amount of time would do any good.  tl;dr - ""Yuck""  6/21/19"
