5.0,"The master blender responsible for this whisky describes it as dessert in a bottle and one of his top 6 whiskies he’s blended.  

The nose is sweet and caramel with a hint of sherry. This isn’t the whisky’s strength though. 

The palette is incredibly smooth and all 21 years show up. Beautiful, sweet and a mix of delicate corn and sherry. On the finish there is spice and hints of European wood.  

This whisky is super sessionable.  A great drinking whisky at the ideal proof.  

About 4400 bottles in the limited run. My favourite Canadian and one of my favourite whiskies period.  

To be safe I bought two more bottles for backups.  Highly recommended."

4.5,Old leather library books meets wine gummies on the nose followed by a smooth and very rich palate remnant of rum raisin ice cream. The finish is tannic in nature and not overly long but certainly satisfying.
