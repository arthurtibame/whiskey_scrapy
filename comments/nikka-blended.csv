3.5,"My second Japanese Whisky ever tastrd. The first one was the hibiki Harmony which was beautiful. 

It is a fairly good whisky, you can tell it is very young by just tasting it, it is a little bit tricky since it is very different on the nose compared to the palate.

As soon as you open the bottle you'll inmidiately grab a honey note. On the glass you'll find the floral notes of any japanese dram, there is very little peat, vanilla, but the most noticeable aroma is orange peel. 

On the palate is totally different. As soon as you taste it the impression is what is this? I haven't nosed this. 

There is a wood flavor. Not the oaky wood flavor but another wood. Maybe Cardboard. Very interesting. Wet cardboard. Very peppery, very nutty, with a medicinal remedy touch. (Remedy for the throat)

Very interesting flavor but, it is medium body and has NO FINISH AT ALL.  That is a fail which i cannot accept so points are deducted.

Nevertheless is a good whisky, i had fun tasting and nosing it. I recommend it. 75/100"

4.0,"Tasted this after having a Highland Park 12, which I would rate 85ish. (just so you can compare what my taste is a bit)

This is quite a nice one in my opinion. It feels very light, had to check the bottle again to see the alcohol percentage. There is a neat little spicy aftertaste. Best blend I have tasted so far."

4.5,"Мягкий, запах почти парфюмерный. Интересное послевкусие, приятная маслянистость. 
Фруктовые нотки, но без излишней сладости, никакого сахара не чувствуется, очень приятный, интересный для целенаправленной пробы"
