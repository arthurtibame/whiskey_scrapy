3.0,Chris bought me this in Japan. Not as nice as other Japanese Single Malts. Not too Peaty but a bit alcoholic on the tongue. Not really much after taste.

2.0,"Nose - Initially very little alcohol, clean crisp floral pear-pineapple sweet/sour, green hay, riesling/moscato sweet, faint plum wine made from sour green plums.
Taste - Toasted barley cereal, toasted rice at the bottom of a stone pot, toasted sour green apple skins, almost like a sour lambic apple cider made entirely with apple skins because it's lightly bitter.
Finish - Light medicinal finish, lingering sour, almost like an overoaked riesling in that it's a bit sour, but also sweet. A tiny bit bitter like that of apple skins, but that fades.
Score - 67/100
Final Thoughts - So initially the nose on this wasn't that bad, it wasn't great, but it wasn't off-putting either. On first sip my initial reaction was that it tasted like a liquefied version of toasted barley cereal in that it tasted exactly like a sample of toasted barley I had during a distillery tour. This quickly turned to be dominated by fruity sour notes. It's not horrible, but not my favorite. I guess you might like this whisky if you're a fan of the sour lambic beers as this kind of tastes like a light version of a sour lambic beer that is mixed with diluted apple cider vinegar."

3.75,Spiced apple and oatmeal at the forefront with an interesting subtle smokey seaweed flavor that comes in on the aftertaste! Can’t wait to explore other expressions

4.0,"Okay, this is the first proper Distiller entry made contemporaneously at the time of drinking rather than from memory. 

Floral notes up from. Then a burst of woody flavor (oak, apparently). Tobacco and char notes on a short-medium finish."
2.0,"Shabu favorite if only because it’s comparatively cheap while still being palatable if consumed quickly. If you’re getting rounds, you’re getting Akashi, but it’s honestly not that bad. Mild body with a nice peaty kick, perfect for chasing with a real whiskey."

3.5,"In times where fake Japanese whisky is flooding the market, it is refreshing to have malts like Akashi. Originally a sake producer, Eigashima built White Oak Distillery in 1984. The nose of this Single Malt is very Japanese: polite, elegant and restrained. Yeast dough, maple syrup and shortbread mix with anise, lime and hints of baked apple. Honey-sweet and full-bodied in the arrival, the taste develops gingery and oaky with matcha green tea, juniper and sour berries. Licorice, fresh herbs and fading tannins mark the substantial finish. What a pleasant surprise!

1.75,Meh. Sweet and no substance
3.5,"Light, muddy and hard to pick out individual flavor notes. It’s pleasant enough but at the price it’s a hell no."

3.5,"Refined nose with sweet earthy notes. Mildly salty and sweet palate that transitions to an earthy and fruity boquet. Finish is short, spicey, and leaves the taste is sea salt to linger until the next sip."
3.75,"Sharp cedar flavor on the tongue, as well as a spice kick. The mouthfeel is Rich and nice, but that flavor has never been my favorite. Water accentuates wood even more. Light peat, nicely balanced after water"
