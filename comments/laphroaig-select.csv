3.0,"Picked this one up in Duty Free, and it has a special place in my heart since it got me into drinking Single Malts. I had tried Whisky before of course, but wasn't a big fan. This one made me understand that it can be quite a complex and enjoyable drink, and that I like my Whisky smokey.

Since that first experience I got to taste quite a few other drams and came to realize that there are a lot more complex and satisfying Single Malts out there, but I still happily pour myself a glass of the Select while reading a good book.

Nonetheless, my next bottle from Laphroaig will be the 10, which I consider much better value for money than the Select."

3.0,"Dinner with friends and enjoyed beer and wine. Saw this in the stock and ordered one for sipping through good conversation. The peat is immediate and on the sweet side. Some faint fruity notes arrive once the peaty-smoke fades.  The body is thin and light and delivers, at first, a light oak that's slightly funky(?), but not off-putting.  Finishes on the short side with brown sugar/toffee and oak.  I did notice that, over time, since I sipped this slowly all evening, it become a much sweeter and softer dram.  Time and patience with this one I think is warranted.  A simple enjoyable dram.  A decent balance between smokiness and sweetness. [85/100][Tasted @ Mannino's; 11/21/15]"
2.0,No balance in this whisky. It lacks identity. The sum of different Laphroaigs is less then one of the others.

3.0,"I bought this today on a recommendation.  I went to my local store this evening, just to see what's new.  The store manager suggested Yellowstone bourbon (and I promptly ignored him, since he was the same guy that recommended Wasmund's as the second coming of Macallan).   But, I ended up in a conversation with a  guy who works at a whiskey bar in NYC.  He said his favorite all time was the Yamazaki 18, followed closely by the Laphroaig 32 and High West Midwinter.  He recommended this a milder version of the 10, and well in the affordable category ($60 in central NJ).  So...my humble opinion on this:  it's not your classic ""punch you in the face"" Laphroaig.   It's tamer.  Not refined, just tamer.  Big difference.  Nose still has that medicinal aroma, but cleaner and milder.  Not peaty, but a wisp of smoke.  Palette is a bit of a mash up.  Fruity.  Like stone fruits and grilled peaches with honey.  Finish is stronger---you can feel the smoke now.   What I like about this is that it's simple, yet complex enough.  It's smoky, but not too much.  It's peaty, but not overly.    What I don' t like about it is that it's all over the place.  I can't really place a finger on a few key elements...instead it has a bit of everything.   It's like family over Thanksgiving (or Diwali in my case).  You have the crazy uncle.  The nosy aunt.  The obnoxious cousin.   The sweet grandmother.  Dinner conversation can be nutty ranging from the uncle telling about his motel he owns to the cousin talking about some surgery he performs, to the young nephew talking about his college girlfriends.  (all true over my house at Diwali)  But it's family, and it feels just right.  
    I like this one, but I don't like it.  You can have it over summer, rainy days, and well as cold nights.   It's all over the place."

4.0,"Ahh, the in-house blend of most Laphroaig staple single malts.  It starts out well enough with that classic peat smoke that all Laphroaigs open with and continues on to the palate:  creosote smoke, band aid and seaweed brine.  It's all too familiar at this point, yet it's everything I love.  I've tried every malt blended here except that elusive PX cask.

I'm not sure how I truly feel about this NAS offering:  it tickles all the right spots just being its traditional Lahproaig self, but some (spoiled) part of me wants there to be something to set it apart from the rest:  a richer mouthfeel, more smoke, more heat, more....anything.  It just isn't there.  I suppose I should rejoice in the fact it's a tad bit cheaper than the sum of all its parts.  There's that.

...and that's what I'll settle for.  It's Laphroaig, folks.  You know what you're getting.  If it's your thing you're gonna enjoy it and look forward to what's next in their arsenal.  Keep calm and sip on, my friends.  Cheers!"

3.5,"Nose is much less peat-forward than other Laphroaig offerings with sea salt and damp wood backing it up. There is melted butter and lemony citrus, tapioca, and vanilla; however, it is widely constrained for its distillery. Gone are the notes of burning hospital, smoked fish, dirty socks following a stroll through a bog, briny cottage cheese, pharmacological wildness of typical Laphroaig. It's supposed to be a blend of the Quarter Cask, PX, and Triple Wood Laphroaigs (hence the ""Select"") but there is no discernible secondary casking on this dram. Palate is semi-sweet, with mild peat marrying orchard fruit, soot, Confectioner's sugar, and light oak. Finish is medium-long, imbued with the dying embers of an overly moist campfire, sardines, some medicinal notes with a lingering black pepper. It's much less oily than other Laphroaig offerings and, though the finish is the highlight of the dram, it is also feels much too thin compared to its cousins.

Overall, it's objectively a good whisky and distinctively Laphroaig. However, like many of the NAS bottles coming out nowadays, it doesn't have the value proposition of other staples. For the money, Quarter Cask trounces this, as does Triple Wood for a few bucks more."

3.0,"This scotch welcomes you with scents of apple, citrus, malt, and oily peat.  The palate is a bit of a letdown, quite watery, with malt, simple syrup, and orchard fruit flavors again, along with some slightly charred woodsmoke.  The finish is smoky, sweet, and short.  It doesn't linger long enough to pick up much more than that.  This relatively new expression from Laphroaig almost feels like a peated Glenlivet, a resemblance that I picked up on because I'd just had the Nadurra a day or two earlier.  It's eerily gentle and a bit out of character for the distillery.  I know based on the marketing that it's supposed to contain a bunch of different whiskies subjected to different cask aging or finishing, including sherry, but some of those are (at least for me) too subtle to be noticeable.  This could be a decent introduction for new whiskey drinkers to the Islay style.  For more experienced drinkers, it's a little league Laphroaig."

Lore would smoke this one for richness and not a long aftertaste, but still I prefer it to Four Oaks perhaps because of the setting - a small Spanish bar with friends. In of itself its a 3.5 at most but it's very cheap. $45 USD, which is less than the 10 year. And so for that reason it is rounded to a 4 star."

4.0,"Neat in a Glencairn the Nose overwhelms with smoke (not peat, just smoke) but that fades the more time you spend with it. Subsequent nosings become more complex with apple cider, grain, tea, SHERRY, and (don't laugh) Dairy. There was a note I couldn't place and it finally clicked. My grandparents owned a dairy farm and it took me back to the smell of fresh unskimmed milk. This is one I could nose all day. Neat it enters the palate with ash followed by a malty sweetness and heavy Sherry influence. Very Fruit forward. The finish is warm but not hot and coats the palate with Sherry sweetness and peat smoke. The sherry cask finish really dominates both the nose and palate of this one. A splash brings out some vanilla that I didn't pick up before, but mutes everything else with the exception of the ash. This one is best neat. This one in my area goes for $10 less than the Lap10, so I went in expecting Laphroaig ""Lite"" and that is what I got. Oddly, the nose on the empty glass almost mirrors the 10. Drink this when you're in the mood for Peat, but not PEAT. The nose is a 5, but overall it's a 4."

3.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from November 2016

Select is a NAS from Laphroaig. 6 new recipes were created, then voted on by the Friends of Laphroaig and this was the winner. It is a combination of the 10 YO, Quarter Cask, Triple Wood, and PX Cask varieties. I had a 5oz sample from a friend that I used for this review. 

This one comes in at 40% ABV, is chill filtered and is a natural golden color. 

The nose is quite weak for a Laphroaig. Peat smoke up front. It quickly turns to a slightly briny, maritime character. Light oak and sawdust. Some vanilla but not much. After a bit of time in the glass some red fruits show up from the Oloroso and Pedro Ximenez Sherry casks. Some floral notes mixed in there as well. 

The palate is equally weak (for a Laphroaig) to go with the nose. Sweetness initially which becomes a slightly peppery oak. Not too peaty when compared to the 10YO or Quarter Cask. 

The mouthfeel is very thin and unobtrusive. 

The finish is short and uneventful for a Laphroaig. Peat smoke and some pepper that lingers a bit. 

If this was the winner of the contest I would not want to try the other 5. This is a miss from Laphroaig, a brand that I love and hold in high regards. The 10 YO, Quarter Cask, Lore are all great. I have the 18 and 15 year olds that I have yet to try, but I suspect will be winners as well. This one is $5-10 more than the 10 YO so it really makes it that much less appealing. If it was at 43% or higher it may have helped. I can say that if you want a lighter Laphroaig this would be perfect. It's ok for a quick drink after work or in a bar where you aren't dissecting your dram. Select was actually the first Laphroaig I ever purchased a little over a year ago. At the time I thought it was great, but having tried so many more peated scotches I can easily say I will not be buying another bottle. 3.25. Cheers"

3.75,"The final round of the whisky diner of course had to be a smoky one. Choice at the restaurant was limited, but there was this 40% Laphroaig Select at the bar. 
Laphroaig made a blend of Oloroso/white oak/PX/QC and 1st fill bourbon to create this.

Nosing was pleasant with the usual Islay suspects like brine, wood smoke and muddy peat. Iodine was present but less dominant than other Laphroaigs I tasted. 
Red fruits and dry oak completed the nice nosing.

On the palate much of the peat had disappeared, leaving not much more than spicy ginger and apple vanilla with a faint peat and smoke in the back. A bit disappointing at this point.

The medium finish left a musty peat and acidic apple with an underlayer of fresh young oak. Before everything really faded away a sudden surprising iodine did pop up.
But that was too little and too late to save this one.

Although it was not bad. It certainly was the worst Laphroaig I tasted so far.
A bit surprising to me, because I liked the 10 and QC a lot. Those two are within the same price range.

2.5,"Laphroaig tasting evening, Sydney, 26 September 18. Whiskey #1.
    
Nose: Soft smoke with sweet floral flourishes and a maritime hint. Some bright phenols, anise, and a touch of the old-school Laphroaig hospital bandages.
    
Palate: Sweetly smoky arrival. Soft flavours appear as it develops - herbal tisane, black tea, mint, lemon, vanilla and coconut. Later some gentle spicy touches of nutmeg and cardamom arrive.
    
Finish: Medium. Smoke, herbal and a smidge of licorice.
    
Easy to drink, friendly, with a smoke-dominated profile that is tamed and smoothed over by fragrant woody notes. The palate is light but surprisingly, given the complexity of the blend, it's a bit lacking in depth. I'm positive this was developed to appeal specifically to novices, particularly novices of smoky whisky. It's meant to be the gateway drug into Laphroaig, for sure.
    
It's best taken in isolation and not compared to other Laphroaig expressions, as it will always come out second best.  As I returned to nose and taste it during the evening it became increasingly brash, and there was an aroma of cardboard that became more obvious over time.
    
The price is also problematic. It costs the same as the classic 10 year old and even though, in my opinion, that has slipped a touch recently it is still a more subtle and interesting malt.  If money is an issue the 10 year old is better value.

Mostly mild sweet wood, and the smoke follows in on the tail. I honestly don't care much for it, there's not enough there. Interesting flavor change, but all falls flat."

4.25,Typical and lovely Laphroaig. Bit more smooth and mellow as compared to others. Very drinkable
0.5,"disgusting. terrible. appalling. no matter how much i love islay’s and laphroaigs in general and specific, this tastes like a steel plate hitting you in the face and somehow making it’s way to your tongue, desirous as it is for some melting golden sunshine that your brain announced to be expected from this familiar looking bottle from the brand you thought to know so well. i even tried to mix it with anything to dilute it to something drinkable, but even a soda-window-cleaning fluid or anti-freeze-on-the-rocks would surely be more enjoyable."
4.0,Lovely peaty dram compared to the 10 it is lighter smells sweeter and taste builds to a nice sweet peaty finish. Less band aid and medicinal than the 10 but less creamy Steele and depth. Both great scotches I kinda like the 10 for an everyday supper and 10 when I want a full mouth feel

4.75,"Very nice peated smokyness on the nose, notably at first, then it fades and lets your taste explore the complexity of the secondary notes. Same thing on the palate starts strong but fades slowly to unveil the rest of the floral fruit and nuttiness that completes a rich flavor. The peat is incredible you can actually taste the herbal earthy mineral taste of it. Simply delightful!! One of my favorites so far."

4.0,"smooth, long lasting finish"
3.0,"The nose is fairly nice, not powerful, but peat, fruit and honey. But unlike the 10, which I find has a great sweet offset to the peat, the sweetness virtually disappears for me on the palate.  I'm left with a smoke that is strong ash and burnt rubber with a mild barbeque note and ethenol.  Admittedly, that makes it sound worse that it is, but I'm glad I experienced this one in a two ounce sample as opposed to taking a chance with a bottle.

Part of the problem is that I (like most people, I suspect) immediately compared it to the 10, and the 10 is a gem in my book.  Granted, the Select runs about $10 less in my market, but paying an extra $10 is a no-brainer for me in this case."

3.75,"Was up in NH area over this past week, picked this up at Kappy's in Medford MA for $29.99!!! Neat it noses rich smoke, olive brine, vanilla sweetness and oak. Palate brings smoky malt, salty seasoned wood with mild vanilla. Not as robust or deep as Quarter Cask but tasty nonetheless. Finish is long Islay smoke with malt and wood lingering on. Id give the nod to Lap 10 or QCask but this is solid Islay in spite of 80 proof......88/100..... My buddy and I polished off this bottle in one night so its quite drinkable along with very tasty."

3.0,"Another NAS Laphroaig. I’ll be honest, I don’t really understand this whisky.

There’s still the typical TCP, medicinal taste up front, but this time it’s very understated.  It’s a bit all over the place, with little of the usual Laphroaig character coming to the fore.  Smoky, peaty, sweet, brine, citrus, apple, bread - it’s got all of it vying for attention, but making the whole flavour less than the sum of its parts.  The aftertaste doesn’t last long. Sweet and peaty, but quickly forgotten.

As I’ve said many times now, Laphroaig is my go-to dram.  I won’t be adding the Select to my standard cabinet.  It’s OK but I’d pick up a standard 10y/o before this one.  It’s not quite right for me, but then I’m not really sure who it’s for.

If you want a peat monster, this isn’t it.  If you want something that shows you all the depth of Islay whisky, this isn’t it either.  If you want a soft introduction to Laphroaig, this isn’t it either - I just don’t get it.  I’m confused by this whisky.  I’ll have to have another couple of drams to try to work it out."

4.25,"My second Laphroaig is this NAS, and i keeps the same profile as the 10yo only a little softer and younger.

Bottled at 40%abv, with an old gold color.

On the nose it starts with that exciting and unreal aroma of a ""fresh can of tennis balls"", with other notes of burnt hay, phenols, rubber, peat, cola and prunes.

On the palate, it starts watery, with caramel for a short moment, then it switches to burnt meat, burnt rubber pepper and a peaty medium finish.

A typical Islay, for 28 Euros is a cheap and great offer. I could recommend this for the islay lovers who are a little low on cash. 

This is a solid 86 over 100, making it more than a fine whisky. Cheers!"

3.0,"So friendly, the friendliest of Laphoaig's. At 40% it's the people's Laphroaig, but I think it falls short as to satisfying why people drink Laphroaig in the first place. This falls into just an okay Islay for me."

3.75,"The nose is mild smoke, second wave is medicinal/Band-Aid stuff. There is a spicy/habanero heat in the nose that I wasn't expecting. It really stings the nostrils, in a good way.

The first taste is a surprising burn; it's a heat that delivers on the habanero promise in the nose. Smoked meat. It truly burns the roof of the mouth a bit, which is incredibly interesting.

This one definitely benefits from a drop of water to turn down the heat. The heat still slaps but is less harsh. The peat manifests this way in a muddy, boggy sense with just a touch of burn in the way down.

The finish is matchbox and smoldering fire. If you're not a fan of spicy/heat, you may not take a shine to this one. I, on the other hand, am fully on board."
