5.0,"So every once in a while you get to sample a Whiskey that knocks you off you feet, forces you to sit down and properly ponder it. This is one of those times! 
So let me back up. Me and my good buddy @Neveruseice
decided to start blind tasting samples as a way to share honest and unbiased opinions. We send them to each other simply number 1-4. We share notes and then provide each other the reveal. It's a great, fun way to taste with someone who doesn't live close by (in this case CA vs AZ). 
So this brings me to this dram. It was simply labeled as sample #3. Nosing it you get classic Bourbon notes of oak, burnt brown sugar, caramel, circus nuts and some alcohol. I knew I was in for a big Whiskey based on the nose. I dive in for the first sip and it's love at first sip. Burnt brown sugar, toffee, and vanilla lead. The mid palette introduces nuts, butterscotch, clove and a heavy dose of oak. We then move to leather, barrel spice, honey dipped peanuts and a lingering oak note. The finish is the star of the show and just doesn't end. Now up until this point the proof really hasn't showed itself, but on the finish you get a Kentucky Hug to end all hugs! It literally makes you take a seat because it fills your chest with heat in the best way! 
Man they just don't make them like this anymore! This batch was from 2014 and is hands down one of the best I have sampled. The finish is for sure the best I have had of any Booker's batches.
Big thanks to @Neveruseice for pulling this one out of the vault to share and Cheers all!"
