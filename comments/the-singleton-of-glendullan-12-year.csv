3.0,"Quite gentle. Middling inoffensive flavour, a little sweet, some toffee, doesn't linger much. No peat or tannin, only the lightest pepper or spice. Full, briny, salty, a bit fruity. (Actually The Singleton 12 y.o. From Glen Ord.)"

5.0,This bottle has never failed to shut the snobs up. It's a $ buy for a $$$$ taste.  But it's getting harder to find.
3.0,An amazing burst of fruity flavors with a pleasantly sweet aftertaste. An 'easy sipping' whiskey.

Sherry and overripe borderline rotten apples fallen off the tree nose. Light body but delectable golden raisin and pear wine flavors with classic salt and light woody character. A fine aromatic wood finish.

3.0,"I picked this up on a whim because I couldn't believe there was a 12yo single malt available for $16. It was a good decision. 

Faint pear and oats on the nose. Palate is dominated by honey and vanilla with flashes of green fruit, cut grass, grain, and wood tannins. Soft and sweet. Finish is more fruit and vanilla and every once in a while a whiff of smoke. 

It doesn't need water and it gets flabby if you let it oxidize. Benefits from a fresh palate; I find it tastes better before noon. 

This isn't the best whisky in my cabinet but it also isn't the worst, and this bottle sees the light more often than any of my more expensive ones. It's a fantastic value for a solid unpretentious dram."

3.0,"Back in college I had this friend, we’ll just call him M.  I remember this time M took me out for a drink, to talk things over when I was contemplating breaking up with this girl, who we’ll call K.   You see, K was simple.  A sweetheart.  There was no drama, no unforeseen surprises, just straight in her lane simple.  M told me that to truly appreciate K, I needed to break up with her and date a few girls he knew.  I did that.  I broke up with her.  M set me up with a friend we’ll call A.  A was fun.  Batshit crazy scary fun.  A few times driving at night in the pitch dark rural backways, she’d turn off the headlights and speed up, counting to ten, and then suddenly break and turn the lights back on.  This excitment must have triggered some hormones to immediately engage in acts I shall not post here.   Then there were other examples of such crazy risqué behavior.  Like having a picnic at a graveyard at midnight, again triggering the same hormones mentioned earlier.  Anyway, that was A.  And I started to realize how nice it was to have  the simplicity, and freedom from death, with K.  This whisky here is my K.  It’s simple, boring, and nice.  A was my quarter cask, cask strength Laphroaig.  You can have those just so many times, till you come back to these and appreciate its simplicity.  Thanks to @Scott_E for this sample as part of our round 5 trade."

3.0,"2018 Miami Whiskey Mash offering.  We tried both the 12- and 15-year varieties of the Singleton of Glendullan back to back.  It seems like this whiskey is Diageo's attempt to create a new entry-level step for drinkers graduating from blends to single malts.  These whiskies are cheap, meted out at the minimum possible ABV, and packaged attractively in elegant, distinctive canteen-shaped bottles.  If I had to guess, the target market is early-to-mid-20's, just starting to graduate beyond well drinks -- you know the type.  The flavor profile also demonstrates that this scotch is aimed at taking market share from the Glenfiddich/Glenmorangie/Glenlivet trio of omnipresent single malts.  Overall, the end result here is pretty impressive given the price point.  This is a light, sweet, fruity scotch, but without any of the bitterness or other flaws I occasionally detect in the finish of its competitors."

3.0,"I got caught up in the current momentum of the recent sampling amongst our group of this dram. I had to go ahead and pour this for a tasting.  The feedback seemed generally positive, but tasting for oneself is the true test. 

Floral and honey nose primarily.  Honeysuckle on a warm spring day.  Traces of sherry with walnuts, apples, dried apricots, vanilla cream soda, banana bread.  A fairly full nose. 

An extremely thin but velvety arrival.  A sweet dram, it is. Butterscotch and brown sugar sweetness.  Arnold Palmer (lemonade and sweet tea)  flavors arrive as the dram delivers the final flavors towards the finish. 

A short finish of lemon zest, white pepper, bakers chocolate with some barrel char. 

I had my doubts about this whisky. The low cost, the packaging (just a bottle, not boxes or tins).  Much to my pleasant surprise, this is an enjoyable, easy, sweet sipper.  It will not blow your doors off, no.  But you will enjoy this. Easy on the nose, palate and wallet.  [84/100][Tasted: 2/24/18]"
3.0,"Stop number 69 on the SDT is Glendullan. Glendullan is a single malt better known as The Singleton of Glendullan. There is a long story about the origins of the name Singleton, which I won’t bore you with, but it’s interesting to note that there are three different Singleton brands. In the USA we get The Singleton of Glendullan, in the U.K. it’s The Singleton of Dufftown, and in Asia it’s The Singleton of Glen Ord. All are Diageo owned. 

This 12 year old Speysider is bottled at 40% ABV and as many Diageo products are, this is most likely chill filtered and has colorant added making it a solid amber color. 

The nose is honey, very floral honey, followed by a strong malty note. A brief hit of sherry followed by very sweet fruits. Apples, apple juice, oranges and apricots. Cherry limeade and a candy-like sweetness reminding me of strawberry jellybeans. Light bananas and walnuts. Vanilla buttercream and toffee with a sprinkling of cinnamon. A bit of oak, fresh cut green oak, and some minty herbs. 

The palate is malty with honey and a lemon/lime citrus. Bananas and a hint of chocolate. Some slightly bitter oak, but it’s well balanced. Light oranges and apricots. 
While tasting, my wife started cooking dinner and the house was filled with the aroma of chicken scampi. It completely changed everything I was getting from the whisky so I stopped there. 

It has a light bodied mouthfeel that is a little creamy and thin. 
A medium short finish with oak, malt, tannins and is on the dry side. 

Not a bad dram, though nothing really jumps out and screams “Look at me!”  A typical profile for a Speyside scotch, just a tad muted. A nice value buy at around $40-45. Not something I would keep around the house, I’d probably go for an Aberfeldy 12 if I wanted something similar. 3.25. Thanks for the sample @Scott_E 
Cheers"
3.0,"Very nice nose with pears, cinnamon, green apples, tea, slight smoke and brown sugar.  It’s a thin mouth coat though on the palate. Same tasting notes and not as good as the nose.  Hmm. On 40% ABV I wouldn’t want to put water on it but we’ll do a couple drops anyway.  It brought out even more molasses and oranges on the nose, but just brought out some vanilla and cream on the palate.     The finish is a bit dry and short.  For 40 bucks a nice sipper indeed. It can easily hang with the Highland Park Magnus. It’s a 3.0.  A theme for the dram should be something simple and effective. Something like “Break On Through (to the Other Side)” by The Doors. Thanks for the sample @Scott_E!"
3.0,"Another review for another distillery group sample.  This is from Speyside distillery, Glendullan.  Specifically the Singleton 12 year old.  Funny enough, this bottle is from the 40% ABV version and not the 43%...getting greedier ‘Dullan?  It was provided for the group by my buddy Scott.  Thanks bro.

The nose is mostly cereal malts and oak with the faintest bit of cinnamon creeping in after it sat for a little while.  The fact I got a lot of oak from a forty percenter is amazing.  The palate is all Speyside:  apples, banana and citrus peels with vanilla and wood tannins bringing up the rear.  The mouthfeel is incredibly light, but mostly enjoyable.  No qualms whatsoever.  The finish is short, even a bit complex:  nice sweetness and rich chocolate notes hung around after the initial warmth from the alcohol.

Overall, this was an enjoyable experience.  When I saw 40% I was a bit worried, but there’s plenty to like about this one and not much to rail against.  I’m not sure about price, but I’d guess it’s pretty reasonable as this is a readily available and easily accessible dram.  Thanks again, @Scott_E.  3.5 stars.  Cheers."

3.0,"Appearance: The color this single malt is showing off is a deep copper or caramel syrup. The legs are thin and slightly viscous.
        
Nose: On the nose one is welcomed by beautiful notes of honey, pine, vanilla, white grapes, baking bread, and the nostalgic scent of walking through the woods.
        
Taste: The palate is not overwhelmingly complicated, but is so delicious and welcoming. Notes of  cinnamon, banana and kiwi, wood tannins, and orange and lemon zest excite your taste buds and invite one in for another sip.
        
Finish: The finish is short in length and has an almost milk chocolate and creamy finish.
        
Thoughts: This is a great single malt scotch. My only small complaint is that this scotch seems like with a higher ABV it would bring out more flavors and “Oomph.” However, I would still recommend it and would buy it again myself. Sláinte!"

4.0,"So glad I tried this twice. I bought my first bottle several months ago. Nose and mid-palate were typical of a Speyside--malt, honey, nuts, some slight floral notes, a creamy mouthfeel----then a distinctly medicinal note (not iodine) on the aftertaste. When I came across it again on sale, I thought I would try it again. After all, my second bottle of Dewar's 12 yo was much better than my first. So glad I did. This is really quite good. No medicinal overtones but all the good notes through-out, nose to finish. Not as complex as some others I really enjoy; but, it is half the price--or less. A wonderful daily dram. Update:  I discovered a partial bottle of this that I had opened months ago. Wow!!! With a little air in the bottle and time to breath this has become wonderfully smooth and flavorful with no bitter notes whatsoever. It reminds me very much of the fantastic Darwhipple 15. When I open my next bottle I will be sure to allow it to rest for several minutes before I try it."

4.5,"Nose: Sweet and fruity. A clean sweet smell that has some oak notes but mostly plum smell. Plum and apricot notes dominate the nose. It is very pleasant on the nose
Palate: Caramel and more oaky notes. There is less fruit on the initial taste than in the nose, however the taste still sweet and full bodied. There is a pleasant thickness.
Finish: More wooden notes and a slight bitter finish. However, as the whiskey continues to linger, more honey and vanilla notes appear.
Overall, this is a very pleasant scotch, especially for the price paid. Definitely one that I will keep coming back to."

Some of that charred oak is present; it's got a sharpness in the swallow that could be the sherry or maybe some burnt wood. A slight fusel burn in the finish that accentuates the flavors. 

It's the first Scotch whisky I've had thus far that I can really pick up on the sugary sweetness. A supremely enjoyable (dessert?) Scotch."
