3.5,"This is a hard one to rate. Well crafted, well balanced...but man that spearmint I really don't like. To be fair it's the best example of a heavy spearmint flavored whiskey I've tried and I actually finished the sample. I wouldn't be running back for 2nds though. Quite polar opposite to the rye profile I like..spicy rye no mint of any kind. 4 for quality 2.75 flavor. 3.5 for fairness."

4.0,"A high barley content, 49%. So it is not as sweet if it had corn or higher rye %. You get the grassy, cereal notes you would expect from barley, with a slightly sweet flavor with nuanced spices, including pepper from the rye. Local liquor store brought it in but now discontinuing because no ones buying. Price point is $50ish but the odd mash bill turns people away from trying. I’m glad I did."
