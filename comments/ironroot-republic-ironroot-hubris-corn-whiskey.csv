4.5,"This king among corn boasts a darker orange copper color with thicker semi-viscous legs clinging to the glass.

The nose is rich and dark. There are notes of dusty hay, apple, brown sugar, vanilla, mixed berries, cotton candy, and oak.

The palate is dry and full as well, with notes of pear, grape Jolly Rancher, cinnamon sugar, creamed corn, and baked sweet potato.

The finish is spicy with a taste of peach, and not lasting too long.

Okay, this corn whiskey blew my mind! I didn’t think a whiskey in that category would be this full of flavor and complexity! I highly recommend, and I will definitely be looking for this again! Ironroot Republic, Thank you so much! Cheers!"
4.5,"I like it.

I had this at the distillery, and it was a pleasant change of pace. This whiskey has that sweeter, corn flavor with a hint of vanilla, but there’s much more complexity in this than say Mellow Corn. The variety of corns used in this adds layers of spice on the palette that I really liked. 

Personally, I like starting with a dram of Mellow Corn as a “warmup” whiskey and then pour a couple ounces of Hubris afterwards. Helps me appreciate the nuance of flavors in this even more. 

One of the best corn whiskeys!"

5.0,"Whiskey 🥃 Grilling Time! Review 

Ironroot Hubris Straight Corn 🌽 Whiskey 

Aged 29 months

ABV% 58.9
 
Mash:

100% Corn
Distiller Ironroot Republic (Deniston, Texas)
This whiskey is making this distillery famous - a straight, complex 100% corn whiskey with loads of flavour. It has won best corn whisky awards in addition to others - not the typical unaged or barely aged corn spirit called ""corn whiskey"" (there are no regulations around aging corn whiskey in the USA).

Nose:

Grape, bubblegum, spices, cinnamon, oak, fresh pizza dough, celery, and an oily richness. 

Front: 

Right off the bat there is a sweet, full of candy-fruity notes (pear, candy grape) and finishing with oak and porridge.

Back/Finish:

Balanced with the complex fruit character. It’s a delicate balance – the youth is no were to be found the deep oak wonderfully shows the interesting distillate. The finish has some heat oak. The complexity blooms when water is added, but it is nice, big, and rich at cask strength. Right now this is the best American corn whisk(e)y I’ve ever had to date. Damn good!

Yippee Ki Ya beautiful people!"
