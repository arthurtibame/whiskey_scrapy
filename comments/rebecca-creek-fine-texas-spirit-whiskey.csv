3.0,Interesting and flavorful but I disagree that this is a smooth whiskey. It certainly has a bite to its finish.

2.0,"Nose of caramel, cream and light smoke.  Thinner body; sweeter taste.  The flavor is not distinct in any way.  Touch of spice towards the finish, which is short to mid.  Best mixed with 7 Up.  Not top shelf; but a bit above bottom shelf swill."

4.0,Has a strong sweet caramel nose. Sweet caramel flavor. Oak & caramel finish that warms on the way down. Nice lingering warmth. Batch 2. Bottle #11341.

3.0,"Color: The color on this blended Texan is a light caramel brown. The legs are really watery and thin.

Nose: On the nose I find notes of caramel, oak, sweet butterscotch or cotton candy, salted nuts, and the overall impression of a dry white wine; it has an alcohol mixed with sweet fruity sort of presence.

Taste: The palate on this whiskey features notes of leather, buttered toast, corn, and a slight strawberry and cherry note reminding me of Twizzlers candy.

Finish: The finish is quick to medium in length, leaves me with little to no burn, and has afternotes of red apples with cinnamon, basically an impression mom’s apple pie. How much more American can you get?

Thoughts: For this proud Texas spirit, I paired this whiskey with a bowl of carne asada fries, so needless to say, it was a fine afternoon. As far as the whiskey itself, I found it relatively complex and very interesting. There were tastes in this whiskey I hadn’t found anywhere else, and I was pleasantly surprised. I like it! Thumbs up, Rebecca Creek! Cheers!"

1.0,Who in the world adds vodka to whiskey and sells it.  Did not like this at all.  It was difficult to choke down even with Coke.  I gave it one star because it did give me a buzz.

1.0,"Way more ethanol on the nose than you’d think for an 80 proof. Same on the palate. Simple. Vanilla, oak, ethanol. The finish is slightly unpleasant. It has an odd flavor that tastes synthetic. It’s like vanilla frosting that is very sweet and has been left out of the fridge for about a day. If you want to feel like you’re getting more drunk than you actually are, drink this. Or if you want a headache. Otherwise, stay away."

3.0,Visited tasting room a few weeks ago and had a flight of beverages.  All good.  Later found bottles at local store and confirmed Rebecca Creek is smooth.
3.25,Fairly warm and sweet up front with hardly any burn throughout. Tastes what I would think the color amber should taste like and has mild earthy and fruity notes.
