5.0,Amazing flavor notes and a clean finish! Couldn't ask for better. You can taste each of the five grains and how they work together in every sip.

4.0,"Very mild (even Steph liked it), but some complexity that is very nice."
5.0,"Being from nearby, we've had this whiskey on our minds and in our glasses since it came out.  Seems fitting to leave a review.

It's a complex whiskey, for sure.  5-grains, and you can taste every one of them  in sequence.  love that rice spirit finish (i tasted a butternut squash from it, gentle lactones).  Not over oaked; you can actually taste the grains, plus the esters in the oak.  It's a winning combo and I guess it's what seperates the old whiskey (hiding behind years of oak) versus less than 4 year whiskey (this is at least 2 year, they said)."
2.0,"I tasted at the distillery with Mrs. Redmond.  A great saki like finish.  Some folks in my tasting group really love it.  It's not a true KY Bourbon, but we'll made and tastes differently with every sip."
3.75,Smooth and sweet.

3.5,"South Carolina bourbon. Tastes light. Full nose. Not too much bite. Alas a bit of a headache, likely one of the grains."

5.0,"5 stars for 5 grain. There is nothing quite like this great bourbon..wow! Soft oak notes followed with a hint of the 5 grain secret, rice, giving it a very well balanced flavor."
2.5,Grassy
4.0,"Vanilla, caramel char, toffee, sweetness

aged 2 years according to the sales rep at the tasting I got this from."
5.0,"This spirit is big and bold, but finishes quickly and clean.  I get a spicy aroma and a kick of flavor that highlights every grain used in the mash bill.  The rice makes it have an almost sake finish.  Such a unique bourbon!"
5.0,Delicious and nutritious. This is a whiskey. My personal favorite they make is the avena oat. Mmmmm

5.0,5Grain Bourbon is one of my favorites! I love the peppery spice right on the finish.
