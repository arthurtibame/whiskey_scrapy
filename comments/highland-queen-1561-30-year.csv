3.5,"Enjoyable, very drinkable neat.  Not smoky not peaty.  A bit of oak, tiny bit of sweetness. Not terribly complex but that is a good thing"
4.0,"'The folly of one man is the fortune of another', they say. At 45 €, this bottle of 30-year-old Highland Queen was an unbelievable bargain. With a malt content of over 75%, Tullibardine seems to be the main contributor. Oranges, tinned peaches, toffee and a light 'sherry overcoat' define the nose, with notes of banana and nutmeg hiding in the back. The age shows on the palate: fruity, spicy and aromatic flavors take turns, all very balanced and with a surprisingly long and satisfying finish. Forget about 'smooth' - this blend has depth and a real personality!
