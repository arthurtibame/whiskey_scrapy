3.25,"Taste-  neat in 2 oz. Glen cairn

Nose-  a bit subdued once the ethanol clears out.  I then get a masa type, stoneground corn smell (think unsalted tortilla chip), dusty peanut shells, barrel char, and black licorice.  It is not your typical bourbon nose.

Palate-  the taste is floral upfront,  perhpas on the line of honeysuckle? The palate also has hot buttered sweetcorn, and a hint of the dusty peanut shells.  There is also some smoke in their as well.  Reminds me of roasted corn over a charcoal grill. The mouthfeel is richer then the actual palate.

Finish-  stone ground corn, creamed butter, floral kind of like sweetpea.

Overall:  Pleasantly different.  The weakness is that the flavors are not as vibrant as I might would have wanted them to be. They don't jump out at you and there is some searching involved  This is a subdued offering.  The strength is that the white corn although removing caramels, and butterscotch sugary elements, did impart some tasty floral and dusty elements that made you dig in.  Way different then the traditional Woodford, or the sweeter, chewier and charred Double Oaked.  It is a good case study of how different corn in the mash can impart different flavor.  This will lend itself easily to scotch drinkers who disdain the more sugary notes in bourbon, and embrace the more floral notes."
3.75,"sweet vanilla dusty corn on the nose and taste.  once you can ""see"" past the dusty corn,  it's white and green fruit with caramel sweetness.  
taste the last drop in the glass and you'll get caramel butter corn and hint of chocolate.  didn't seem too complex at first but Im liking it more each glass.  not worth 130 but definitely worth 60. this is my first of the master collection and my favorite woodford so far"

3.5,"Nose is sweet- vanilla and flora overtones with a hint of spice. Unique flavor, a mix of vanilla that gives way to Spice, which kicks in after a few seconds and remains on the palate."

4.0,"Smell: a little spicy for woodford
Palate: a little sweeter and smoother than normal woodford but not by much. Barley finish. Absolutely no burn. I like it a pretty good amount. Is it worth $100? You know this is the first bourbon that I’m not sure yet."

4.0,I have had each of the Masters collection and this is my least favorite. Very soft taste and all front of the palette. I do not get much of an after taste or smoothness like the others.

Incredibly bland and sweet palate with No finish.  I dont recommend this whiskey. Another big miss for woodford masters collection series"

4.0,"Solid old-style bourbon from a major distillery. Unique sweet corn flavor brightens the oak and vanilla notes on the tongue. 

I would recommend keeping this one neat because it has an open presentation that water or ice would diminish"
