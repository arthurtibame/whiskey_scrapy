4.0,"Will review this one again after it opens up a bit.  Neck pour neat initially I’ll say it’s a bit disappointing but that’s mainly because it’s a $150 bottle so expectations are high.  For a BIB 15 year old bourbon get classic wheat notes
of cherry, cinnamon, brown sugar and little pepper spice on finish.   Def get the oak on nose and palate with a short to medium finish.  This is a good bourbon don’t get me wrong, beautiful bottle, however there are many others in the $50 -$70 range just as good if not better.

3.75,"I graciously received a 2oz sample over the weekend and was able to do a side by side comparison between it and the open 9yr I had handy. 

Before we dive into my notes and thoughts a little about the Old Fitzgerald line. It's a twice annual highly allocated release from Heaven Hill Distillery. It features their Wheated Bourbon Mashbill (70% Corn, 20% Wheat and 10% Malted barely) like their Larceny line. It is also designated as Bottled in Bond so therefore comes with an ABV of 50%. This specific release is also age stated at 15yrs, the oldest ever Old Fitz Release with the highest price tag to compliment that! Let's dive in:

It enters pretty soft given its age and ABV with very rich notes of butterscotch and burnt brown sugar. Chocolate covered strawberries leads the mid palate with some old leather. The finish is pretty lengthy and dominated by oak and a ton of wood spices. It's very pronounced but I do think it does a nice job of balancing the earlier sweetness. It's not over oaked in my opinion but Heaven Hill should probably stop here and not release a bigger age statement for this expression. 

In conclusion I think this is a well executed aged Bourbon that strikes me as if Heaven Hill were trying to replicate the Elijah Craig 18 yr profile. This one isn't as good as that nor is it the best Old Fitz they have released (I personally like the 13yr and 9 yr quite a bit more than it). It's still excellent just not outstanding.

Cheers all!"

4.0,"After about a month with some air...
Nose: Oak, Fruit, Vanilla, Sugar
Palate: Oak, Old Wheat, Crem Brulee or Brown Sugar, Fruit
Finish: Spicy and sweet with a lingering burn. 

Verdict: Overall, I like this, but there are much better whiskeys out there for a quarter of the price. Not sure if it's worth the $150 MSRP, but it's an ornate bottle with some very nice bourbon in it. This is the oldest whiskey I have tasted/purchased and I would love to try this head to head with Pappy 15."

3.0,"Hmm. Oak and vanilla on the nose. Some cherry too. All I'm getting on the first pour. Oak and a hint of apple on the palate, then cherry. Some spices"
5.0,Smoky almost like an old fashioned.   Good flavor depth. Not too hot.  Smooth finish with mild burn late.
3.5,"Hasn’t gotten better, still disappointed with this one.  A bit too Oaked, get more of sweet baking spice (cinnamon) on most other wheaters and this one is straight pepper.  Nose is great but palate turns into a bitter wet oaked , medium /short finish"

3.0,"Great vanilla on the nose, but a little to dry if me on the taste with almost a citrus tone."
3.75,"Well, if this sucks I got a fancy bottle.

Nose - Very sweet and there's a mix of oak, bubble gum, a touch of cherry..pretty much a classic wheater style nose with a bit more alcohol and oak than you might get from some of the younger expressions. As it opens up I get a huge french vanilla like finish to the nose. 

Taste - really complex bourbon and sometimes wheat forward bourbons are a bit lacking there. There's a nutty element that while light is adding a nice complexity all throughout this one. Cherries, rich dark oak, caramel, burned brown sugar, and an very so light bit of vanilla. The 50% abv is perfect giving this full body, intense flavors, but not burning my tongue like heavily oaked cask strength bourbons can.

If you want an older wheated bourbon, buy this over Pappy. It's better though it is a bit more traditional bourbon while the pappy line is sweeter. As always there is no true ""replacement"" for a 15-23 year old Pappy, but this is closer than a weller due to the added time in the barrels. 

3.75, just short of exceptional but maybe i'm being too hard a grader on this. As always I reserve the right to come back and modify the score."

3.75,"Nose: cola, honey, orange peel, raisins 
Taste: woody, nuts, salt, spices
Finish: smooth, caramel"
5.0,"Nose- Caramel sweetness, rich oak, vanilla toffee, candy corn, honey, peanut oil, molasses 

Palate- Confectioners sugar, honey sweetness, cinnamon, deep dark caramel, wet oak

Finish- Long, drying finish on the tongue, with a pleasant creaminess filling the rest of the mouth. Tasty notes of dark, rich caramel, candy sweetness, and toasted oak round it out

Absolutely wonderful. I will say, i’m a huge fan of Old Fitz 9, 11 and 13 so I may be biased, but this is the best of all of them. Excellent although out, and perfectly balanced. Finish is drying just in the right way. The tongue dries out, while the rest of the mouth is introduced to a beautiful creamy mouthfeel, which, in my opinion is everything you want in a finish. I will always strive to keep this on my shelf, delicious stuff."

2.0,"Very light nose, like glancing over sugar with perhaps a glimpse of pineapple. Pallet is heavy sugar undertones with little to no burn and short on complexity. Secondary market pricing must be completely due to the styling of the bottle."
4.5,Super smooth
5.0,"You know how after you finish a glencairn of bourbon the empty glass smells amazing? That amazing smell is the nose, palate, and finish of the Old Fitz 15. Simply incredible."

4.75,"Nose- Candied apples, oak, vanilla
palate- creamy vanilla icing. baking spice. pastries. leather. oak. honey. slight tartness transitions to bright apple notes  through the end.
Finish- Apple lingers throughout the finish. Creamy mouthfeel through out. Slight menthol finish."

4.25,"The nose reveals molasses, vanilla, and you can dig for honeysuckle as well. Palate is highly complex as a 15 year should with ever changing notes ranging from bitter chocolate, to anise, and an herbaceous subtle hint of lavender. The finish is lasting reminiscent of deep earthy red wine berry notes and nutmeg."
4.0,"Moss, chalk, earthy, amazing. Reminds me of the smell of elementary school chalkboards."

4.75,"Review after 2 weeks of opening 

Complex in the nose once you get past the shoe leather and oak. A drop of water brings out the sweetness. Vanilla, Werther's Originals, cinnamon, mint, pipe tobacco, and hints of citrus. Quite potent and interesting nose

Palate shows leather, vanilla, French Toast, caramel, sweet cream, mint, orange, and sweet tobacco. Lingers for quite a while with big tannins, but it has enough sweetness to help keep a balance. Super round and full bodied, loved the mouthfeel with minimal burn. Lasting mint and nutella on the finish, very good. 

Don't give up on this one if at first you don't get much or are disappointed,  this one definitely was lacking right out of the gate. Taste it again after a few weeks and see if you're still disappointed. It is an oak bomb, but it shows complexity and balance. You've got to be in the mood for an aged bourbon, but this hits the spot."

3.0,"Tasted blind. Kind of like Barterhouse but with a backbone.  The oak that might otherwise be pleasant seems to be dominated by ethanol, which is hotter than 100 should be. Not bad, but nothing special either."
4.75,"The color is a glowing amber, very caramel like, and coats the glass nicely in oil. The nose is gentle with caramel, brown sugar, custard and a slight floral note. The palate is rich and mouth coating while somewhat dry, filling the mouth with a wonderful creaminess that has hints of dark chocolate and cooked brown sugar, with caramel coming in at the end. The finish is medium long that keeps you savoring on the creaminess while a slight spiciness fades."
