4.0,"I lost my notes on this, which I tried a while ago, but it left a distinct enough impression to merit recording what has stayed with me. The general idea that Dr. Lumsden and the crew at Glenmorangie pursued here was recreating a turn-of-the-century style malt...and, I do have to say, if they succeeded then I am a little envious of those living in 1903. The fresh, gently fruity and honeyed distillery characteristic is preserved, but it has a greater sense of substance here, as well as lovely autumn woodsy notes and a distant, sweet hardwood campfire. I would drink this again happily...and I'm not always the biggest Glenmorangie cheerleader."
