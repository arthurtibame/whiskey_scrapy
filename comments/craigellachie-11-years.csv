3.75,"This has a very mild flavor but it is also a very delicate one. There is nothing here adding a barring bitterness. There is a fair bit of mineral and a ton of floral flavor. It smells a lot like sea spray. There is some toffee and there is also some apricot blossom. Some sort of meaty nut (maybe chestnut?) mixes in here. The balance is great and the flavors are quite good for what they are. I don't particularly like the choices of flavors though. It's solid all around and is definitely sippable, but I wouldn't buy a bottle unless it were cheap. It reminds me a lot of Bushmill's 21, but is a little meatier and lacking that beautiful finish (though its finish is solid). Also, it is somehow milder. It's an interesting experience that I would be happy to sip, but I'd take something else first. I give it high marks for it's clean flavor, but those are more marks of technical success than of approval. There are a lot of aspects to the delicate flavor, but there is not a deeper complexity. That said, this works for this drink. The bit of gross bread that is here almost pushes the drink down a point but the flavor is mild enough that the drink manages to hold on."
