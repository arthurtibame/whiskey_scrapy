5.0,"This is a great bourbon. Pours a very dark amber with a rich nose. The flavor is deep and complex, dark fruits like plums, toasted oak with a touch of tobacco notes for me. Very long finish with a nice, slight spice on the back palate. Very smooth for 100 proof. Not a lot of hug to it.

Overall, this is an amazing bourbon, though very pricey. Still glad I picked it up for a try."
