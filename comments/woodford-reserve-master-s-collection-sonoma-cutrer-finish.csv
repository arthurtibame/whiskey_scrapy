4.0,Nontraditional but I like the vinous notes and subtle woodyness.

3.0,"Not a bad tasting bourbon,  but the flavor of the barrels is too prominent on the palate and a slightly odd Pinot Noir finish"

3.0,"Heavy on the barrel, a small I've cube helps. Good whiskey but over barreled..."
1.0,"I need someone's comment. I bought this in December 2014 when it came out. I loved this whiskey when I cracked it.  It was cherry pie. I drank about half the bottle within the first couple months. I got back to trying it in the fall and it went bad. By bad, I mean it was un drinkable. It was basically spoiled wine. I ended up dumping half the bottle. I am so disappointed.  All my whiskey is stored in my basement in cabinets. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"
4.0,"Stopped at the Century Bar in Dayton,Oh for a glass.  This is excellent and while it may not appeal to the bourbon purist, I found it to be may favorite bourbon so far.  Lots of warm flavors almost a mix between a apple and cherry pie.  Leaves a very smooth wine taste in your palette."

4.0,Somewhat sweet nose but not super sweet.    Lots of wood coming through on back end.
3.0,"Deep color, rich nose with lots of floral notes, fruits, saltwater taffy, and honey. Very strong nose. Sweet, clove honey on the tongue. Some definite wine tartness, a bit of astringent cherry. Finish is smooth and flavorful. Very nice. 10/18/17
Not as vibrant this time around. Less acidity and tartness than I remember. The nose has an earthy, dank wood note. On the palate, an earthy, almost truffle-like note. This is straightforward: Woodford finished in wine barrels, that's an accurate description of the taste profile. Finish is moderately bitter. This is a new bottle, my previous tasting was at a bar, maybe that accounts for the difference. Too bad, will have to drop this from 4 stars to 3. 6/1/18"
3.0,10-5-17. 3.0.  Did not like - strange smell/ taste.  Very expensive and NOT worth drinking

4.0,Beautiful reddish amber color. Baking spice on the nose with a nice smooth mouthfeel. Cherries on the palate with a nice long finish. This is a nice dram.
1.0,"Pleasant smell. Light spicy bourbon. Sip 1: interesting. Full entry, mid-pallet screams “aged in wine barrels” (strong fermented grape flavor), peanuts on the end. More spicy finish than I expected. Aftertaste is Pinot Noir and peanuts. Sip 2: more of the same. I’m going to finish this one, but I wouldn’t do it again."
