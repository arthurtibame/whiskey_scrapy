4.5,Very nice nose and mouthfeel. Drop of water but no more makes it better
4.5,"Lot 40 3rd Edition Cask Strength

Steps up at a hefty 57%, not my favourite abv as I don’t prefer cash strength. I‘ll comment on 45% and 57%. 

Nose is spicy rye and hints of what you get out of an American whisky that is aged in new barrels. 

At 57% it hits the palette surprisingly smoothly with less burn than you would expect. It’s actually really nice.  The second dip is even better when you are conditioned to the abv. 

Love the finish.  European oak influence shows up, warming and rye spice.  The finish is long and drying.    

It is is really well balanced at 57%, I prefer it as designed and released by Dr. Don.

I cut this to 45% with distilled water and careful measurements. At 45% the palette is super smooth but you lose some of the power and almost all of the spice and drying impact on the finish.  I don’t recommend cutting the proof.  

This whisky is outstanding.  Add this to the list of fantastic and underrated Canadian whiskies."
4.5,"Fantastic body lacking in many Canadian whiskeys. Lots of floral notes, fruit, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, spicy rye, huge amount of fresh oak, and some sherry."
