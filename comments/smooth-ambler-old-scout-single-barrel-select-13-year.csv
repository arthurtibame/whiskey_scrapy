4.0,I really like bold strong flavors of this Whiskey! You can definitely taste the barrel but you get some spice and toffee. The finish is very nice and the barrel becomes a bit more pronounced.
3.5,"Smoky sweet, bbq flavor. Strong burn."
3.0,HFCS flavor but smooth with a few drops of H2O. A bit of antique bite and more enjoyable finish with H2O. H2O is a bump .25 from neat
