1.5,"Almost no scent, unless you really sink your nose into it. The flavor is surprisingly not bad, which is what I was anticipating, but instead, it turns out to be less flavorful than most flavored waters, with only grain notes to speak of, and almost no wood. If used in any cocktails (which is the only use for this from now on), it will probably have the volume used doubled to get any good flavor from this 3 year aged, 80 proof bourbon."
