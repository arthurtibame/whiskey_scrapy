4.5,"Nov 2019.
Clear medium gold.
Medium small tulip.
Aromatic oatmeal, cereal, sweet spicy, milo beverage, sweet maltose, brine, buckwheat soba noodles in nose.
Medium full body with sweet malt beverage, farmyard, oatmeal, multigrain bread and gentle sweet smoke in palate.
Good balance, medium long finish. What a nice sea spray and gentle smoke dram."
