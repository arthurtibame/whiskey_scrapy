4.5,"I’ve had the Small Batch but never a single barrel. Finally found one and am giving it a go.

The nose has cherry, green apple hard candy, brown sugar. On later nosings after the first few sips I really get that Buffalo Trace mashbill #1 dark fruit (plumbs etc).

The palate has some dark fruit, some oak, and a little bit of leather. slightly nutty.

The finish is nice and long. Nothing too overpowering or harsh. Just nice, with a good 100 proof burn.

Compared to my Small Batch, and it’s definitely similar but with a few very different notes. The small batch had more baking spices and leather, where the Single Barrel had more dark fruit and some nuttiness."

5.0,"Out of the Buffalo Trace distillery this bottle is from the Fall of 2017.

Nose: Cherries and honey. Vanilla is also present. Chocolate also shows up at the end.

Palate: Cola, brown sugar, and honey are the most dominant notes. Some spice is also there but was not overpowering. The extra abv really helps with the intensity of the flavors. 

Finish: The cola continues for a short amount of time before fading. What remains is wood influence and a slight tingling that just keep going and going.

This really was gorgeous. The dram was perfectly balanced with a gorgeous mouthfeel. I really don’t have anything but positive heaps of praise for this and to me is a perfect dram. Will certainly be grabbing one every time I see it on the shelf.

Cheers!"

4.5,"CEHT Single Barrel-Fall 2019 
Just realized I'm at my 200th Tasting (can't believe it was almost Skrewball), so I thought I'd review something good. This is a Single Barrel so Your Mileage May Vary.
NOSE: Grape is what jumps out of the bottle on the first cork pop. It is also present in the glencairn as well but fades rather quickly to Dusty Oak, Leather, Varnish, Dried Spices like Black Pepper Cardamom and Allspice. After that initial fruitiness, there is not much sweetness until Marshmallow, Barrel Char, and light Orange Peel show up about midway through. This is a complex shapeshifter if you're patient. 
NEAT: Sweet Clingy Fruit. Apples, Grapes, Pear. ""Jammy"". Not notes I typically get from Bourbon. Some Black Pepper Spice. A Coca-Cola note that is just hinted at. Medium Length Slightly Warming Finish.  Nice coating mouthfeel that leaves Vanilla and Slightly Astringent Musty Oak. Each sip adds a layer, leading to a cumulative layering that is one of my favorite characteristics of a great whiskey. 
SPLASH: The Orange Peel is now front and center on the nose. The palate gains more typical bourbony Caramel and Butterscotch notes. That Cola note that was almost there before? There it is. Oddly makes the finish a little more peppery and spicy. 
VERDICT: If memory serves, this is the most I've spent on a bottle of Bourbon ($72). It's either this or Forged Oak which was also 70'ish. Despite my love of the Small Batch version (if not my favorite Bourbon, it's top 5), I could just never make myself pay an almost 75% premium for the Single Barrel. Now?? I could definitely see myself picking up another bottle the next time I get the opportunity."

4.0,"Marginally better than small batch, and for the price I’ll take small batch all day long. Heavy on the oak, a tad smoky. A tinge of acetone on the nose and finish that I’m sure will tame itself as I let this bottle sit and breathe. A little fruity and a good amount of leather on the finish. I have a feeling I’ll revisit and like this more, but for all the praise this one gets I’m a bit unimpressed. I will say that some variation is to be expected on the single barrels and my experience may not be indicative of everyone else’s, but frankly for the money there are barrel proof options that blow this out of the water."

Palate: Brown sugar, vanilla, oak, char.  Barrel bitter.  Fruity and floral - orange blossoms come to mind again.  Bananas, apricots, fuyu persimmons.  Tannin.  Medium-light mouthfeel with just enough oil to keep things around for a while.  Finish starts with a flash of sweet potpourri, then falls into a less sharp floral and herbaceous direction.  Vanilla, banana, and sweet mandarins then come forward.  Everything then falls down into a sparkly, charred oak note."

Based on the juice, too similar to the small batch. Tiny bit better, but I don’t think I can tell the difference blind. 

Last night I reviewed the 2019 small batch, so I thought it will be fun to do the 2019 single barrel. The bottle has been open a couple months. Just above the should. Tasted in a GC. Sitting out for at least 30 minutes. 

N(4): I did nose it right off the pour. It’s so much more amazing after breathing. Very similar nose to the small batch. Instead of caramel, I get brown sugar. Cherry mint. A little more mint bite. Heavy cherries later on. Some bread notes. Some other sweet fruit comes out. The strength of the aromas are on par with the small batch
P(4): sweet cherries on the front to the mid. Spice comes in right after. Good mouth feel. Not amazing but decent. Black pepper. It’s a bit more vanilla, creaminess, and honey than the small batch. 
F(4): nice hug coating the back of the throat with creamy vanilla. Scraping the tongue to the roof, I pick up slight oakiness and cacao. Medium length and intensity. Get a little bit of pepper bitterness. I would say it’s on par with small batch."

3.75,"Nose: A huge amount of fruit up front - cherry, orange, peach, and something almost tropical.  A little bit of spice and oak, but not a ton of the usual bourbon caramel or vanilla.  After a bit of time in the glass, big notes of brown sugar and molasses to dominate everything else.

Palate:  Unlike the smell, the taste is all spice and caramel/corn sweetness.  Lots of cinnamon, dark honey, leather, and a hint of vanilla.  As it sits, more and more spice appear, though it never loses that corn caramel sugar.

Finish:  Medium length.  Mostly corn dust, soft oak, vanilla, and leather.

Conclusion:  I think I actually like the nose the best.  Super fruity at first, though that sadly disappears as it sits.  Every flavor in here is big and bold, nothing really tries to hide. It's a great bourbon, I just wish the nose stayed fruity."

Silky, gorgeous mouthfeel. Nutty, spicy rye start off the palate that slowly transforms into sweet caramel, cinnamon red hots, touch of leather, and oak. Very little Kentucky hug on this one

It's a bit tame on the nose. But, what's there gives it high ranks as well as the superb palate, mouthfeel, and finish.

3.75,"This tastes a lot like the Colonel E.H. Taylor Small Batch. The wood and spice might be a bit reduced, but there is still some oil and a rancid flavor persists near the end. There is some sweetness, but bitterness and tartness are strong. The rye is clearly present, making this like a more sophisticated rye whiskey that I don't really love. I appreciate the depth and fullness of the flavor, but it's kind of a trial to drink. If at least the cinnamon were less extreme, this would be somewhat more palatable. It is better than the Small Batch though, if only slightly.
Several months later, this smells rich and somewhat fruity but understated. It's less robust and in-your-face than the barrel proof is, but it has a nice amount of woody richness and some balanced fruitiness. There is some notable spice, but it is under control. The flavor is not terribly complex, but it is rich and good. This is a great choice for a sipper. There's some cherry and pepper and clove and smoke (I guess). There's almond and hazelnut adding subtle richness in the background. Everything is in a very nice balance. It's sweet enough but not overwhelmingly so. The corn is present and keeps everything under control. There's some cocoa in here, but this isn't one of those uber chocolatey whiskies. It's a great drink though and is well worth sipping with its cherry, smoke, hint of tobacco, cinnamon, pepper, clove, toffee, nuts, mild tangerine, and vanilla backing. There's a hint of anise, but it's very under control."
