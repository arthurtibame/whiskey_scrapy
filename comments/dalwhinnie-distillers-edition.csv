4.0,"A similar nose the the 15: honey, tea, heather and vanilla; soft and sweet.  A hint of dandelion?  Like a warm spring April day.  A soft arrival, thin and light.  The honey notes dominant which then reveals brown sugar.   A bit of spicy pepper begins to creep in and becomes the primary remnant on the the palate. Hints of oak and drying tannins are the last notes of flavor on the palate.  A good whisky that's easy, not overly complex and enjoyable. Balanced, soft, sweet and dry. [87/100][Tasted: 10/14/15 @ Hartford Hilton]"

4.0,"I had this at my cousin's this evening.  I really what Dalwhinnie does---the simple honey sweet every day dram.  This adds a layer of complexity with the extra maturation.  The sweet honey is now married to a fruitier side, with a tinge of smoke.  In all fairness, I had this right after the Oban Distiller's, which I found far better."

4.0,"Full rounded flavor, good sweetness with a little spiciness on the end. Great dram, glad to have it in the collection!"
4.0,"A very enjoyable dram. On the nose, there's a definite floral note right up front, along with vanilla, Marcona almond, and...grape candy, for lack of a better descriptor. The palate is greeted by a rich, warm, gentle tide of honey, vanilla, almond, honeysuckle (and floral notes), and a bit of pipe tobacco and spice. It's certainly tasty, and (in my opinion) a nice treatment of the classic Dalwhinnie malt. Now, that being said, I'm not sure that this one's worth the (ridiculous) US retail price that hovers in the $90 range...but then again, the classic Dalwhinnie malt isn't worth $70, so overpricing is just sort of the name of the game here."

3.75,"I’m going against the grain on this one. For years, Dalwhinnie was my favorite whisky. So smooth and satisfying it could easily be chugged neat.  I guess the same could also be said of the distillers edition as it delivers in very pleasant fashion. In addition, 16 years of double maturation is both honorable and commendable in today’s market. Unfortunately, though, I rate this a slight downgrade to the core expression, which I see as the perfect mix of honeyed vanilla and toasted almonds. The Oloroso finish does add a modicum of complexity to the palate; however, the disruption comes mainly in the nose. Somewhere, in the 2nd part of the process, a touch of something (sulfur?) is introduced adding a tiny wilt to an otherwise vibrant bouquet. This coupled with an increase in cost has this spirit falling a tad out of  4-star territory."

4.0,"2010 Bottling Nose - Dark fruity honey, grape fruit snacks, musty barrel funk.

Taste - Fruity funky honey sweet, lightly tannic, white grape juice, light waxiness, tiny wisp of smoke tingle, barrel aged pear cider.

Finish - Honey & grape fruit snack sweet, light spice tingle, light musty funk.

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite interesting compared to the standard 15. It added this odd waxy grape fruit snack component due to the Oloroso sherry finish. It masked the hay & bitterness I got from the standard release. The finishing was nice in that it added a bit of complexity to a fairly subtle base.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes, if I was in the mood for grape fruit snacks

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, if it was < $80"

3.0,"From a light and delicate whisky base, the olorosso finish on the Dalwhinnie Distillers edition definitely beefs up the whisky. Increases in characters of dried fruits- in the form of raisins, dried apricots, and light prunes- and baking spices- cinnamon, all spice, and cloves. 
The body of this whisky is noticeably heavier than the core range Dalwhinnie 15, and is chewier and more rounded.
This is a great example of finishing from the classic malts stable of Diageo."

4.0,"Light amber colored. Medium bodied with a milky mouthfeel.

Nose: vanilla, honey, mellow citrus, and sea salt. Some hints of raisins and molasses sweetness. Wonderfully well rounded and smooth.

Palate: soft honey sweetness and some bright citrus appear at the front. The whisky heats up a bit in the middle with some spice, gentle smoke, and some oak before it crescendos into a smooth finish full of warmth, vanilla, and baking spices. There is a lingering spice and fruitiness at the end tingling the palate. 

It’s well rounded, smooth, and balanced. Nothing in particular hops out, it all fits together nicely."

2.25,"Nose: An old musty cereal aroma, reminiscent of a haybarn with a leaky roof. Slightly honeyed and sherried, but primarily a malty nose with grassy overtones. There's quite a distinct grapey top-note that becomes more defined as the whisky rests and develops in the glass. Adding water cripples the nose immediately. [The dry-glass aroma is honey].

Palate: A brisk and almost sour arrival. Cereal and bittersweet malt with hot tannins, hot cinnamon and walnut oil. The texture is oily but astringent. The palate seemed shallow and one dimensional.

Finish: Medium. Sour cereal and oak tannin. The aftertaste is strong overbrewed English breakfast tea with a spoon of white sugar.

The nose gained interest over time but the palate never became more than awkwardly curious - it seemed to me haphazard and unbalanced with more than just a touch of sulphur. Adding water did nothing to help - it just weakened the overall experience.

Whisky is a very subjective thing, as we all know, and in my case I can find little to recommend about this dram - it's just not my sort of whisky. Given the not inconsiderable price it is not one that I'd ever consider buying, and in fact if offered another sample for free I'd probably turn it down.

Tasted from a 30ml sample.

Finish- medium finish with honey, sweef apples and spices 

Delicious. Incredibly balanced. Complex nose and palate with a perfect amount of peat and dark fruits. Love the honey from start to finish. Finish could be a bit longer, but with a nose and palate as beautiful as this, it’s hard to complain."

3.75,"Finally opened the bottle.  On the nose I get fruits like pear or green grapes and a hint of peat.  On the palate the peat subsides to the fruity flavors. Others review states floral notes, but I don’t get that. Maybe I don’t have the palate or baseline to know the difference.  The finish is a little Smokey and lasting.  Overall a good drink."
