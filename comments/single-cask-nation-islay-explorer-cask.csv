5.0,"Best of the night in a drammers club Penderyn and Single Cask Nation joint event. This has a very interesting history as a group of people decided to swim around Islay for charity and carried a quarter cask around with
them, filling the cask with liquid from all Islay distilleries. Some include 10 year Kilchoman Bourbon Cask, 17 
year triple distilled Bruichladdich, 23 year Bowmore Pedro Ximenez casks, 10 year Lagavulin first Fill sherry casks, 15-17 year Douglas Laing laphroaig, 25 year Bunnahabhain, and Kilchoman Sauternes cask. The liquid is great with notes of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, peat, smoke, salt, and raspberries."
