5.0,"Neat. Party Source pick, neck pour.  Brighter than I was expecting for 14 years.  Fresh raspberries and strawberries covered in whip cream. Pie crust, buttery pie crust.  I found the oak but I had to really hunt for it.  Vanilla and cherry.  Delightful nose.  Crisp, creamy ripe fruit pie with a side of natural vanilla ice cream.  

Damn it that is good.  The mouth feel is perfect.  Oily, rolls over the tongue and the flavors just take over.  Cherry and vanilla sweetness.  The flavors just keep coming and coming.  Cherry on cherry on cherry slides into the vanilla and then the oak emerges but it’s still in the form of the buttery, slightly burned crust wrap around everything.  The cherry and vanilla last for as long as you let them too.  

Oh man.  I’ve heard that you need to be careful with these BC14 being over oaked but I can’t see it in this.  The lack of oak and caramel characteristics is a bit jarring but the cherry, fruit, vanilla and pie crust combo is killer.  These Boone County single barrels continue to be my personal favorites in the collection."
4.75,There was a very interesting apple taste straight off the bat with a little balanced spiciness that goes away as mellow as it came.
2.75,"Gallinstein selection #6.  

Nose - Rich dessert level caramel and vanilla with a good oak finish.  This has a bit of the cherry I get on older whisky but it's not really coming out (water doesn't help).  This has hints of old whisky but it doesn't get there and frankly at 14 years it isn't really older bourbon which I tend to find starts at 15 years (seems minor but it is what it is).  A little water does bring out really light hints of peanuts that I'd miss not looking for it.  

Taste - I get some cherry, nice oak, vanilla, caramel.  The flavors are starting to remind me of older bourbon a bit more as this bottle stays open.  Rich and full flavor, really explosive amounts.  The oak is really nice here though not exceptional.  There's a note in here that's a mix of vanilla and oak that comes off a bit young in the middle of the taste and a bit out of place.  This note just keeps killing this one for me and at 250 bucks, I really shouldn't have this one.  Heck I think I actually enjoyed the standard 12 year more than this despite the lower abv and 2 year younger age statement.  

Opening - cherry and rich old leathered wood.  

Transitions to vanilla and young oak.  

Finishes with a bit of caramel and a nice lightly toasted oak but still some youthful wood funk.  

2.75, this feels like a low score and while I try and leave price out of my reviews and use it more for the reader, I just can't not lower this one a bit for the price tag, it's an extremely expensive bourbon and there are just too many off notes going on here for the price.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice whisky, but I've just had so many better ones."
5.0,Delicious!

5.0,I would have to agree with the other gentleman who rated this at 5 Stars as well. Unfortunately I do not own the bottle but thank God for rich friends who want a poor guy to drink bourbon with.
