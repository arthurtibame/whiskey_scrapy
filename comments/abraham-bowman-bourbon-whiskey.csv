4.5,"This is an extremely limited release, consisting of just a few barrels. The Abraham is an experiment every year, and the planned experiment for Release 18 failed. However, they had some delicious control barrels—and the resulting bourbon was offered to a small number of people at a special Bowman Distillery event (how I got mine) and the Virginia lottery. 

Because of the story of how I got mine, I haven’t opened my bottle yet. However, I did taste it at the special Bowman event. From what I recall, it had a sweet nose, was a complex flavor bomb, and you somehow don’t feel the 146+ proof heat at all. 

Lucky to have gotten this one...will have to save it for a very special occasion and special people."
