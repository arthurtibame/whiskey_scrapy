3.25,"Smoke, Pineapple, fruit, rich"
3.0,"You recognize Arran right away, which is one of my if not the favorite distilleries. The nose is really mild and yellow-fruity. There is definite white grapes (the small ones with those really hard seeds), a slight pepper smell as well as a bid of exotic fruits (pineapple), crust of white bread and light oriental spices. Likeable but missing some depth. 

The palate is fruity and hot. Not overly sweet and not as fruity as the nose. But behind a intense and spicy chili burn and a nice bitter sourness there is crackers that are lightly salted and dipped in sweetened jalapeño lime vinaigrette with some good bunch of cloves. It is very dry. 

It is nice, very intense and feels very young. On the opposing side for my taste it misses smoothness and depth."
