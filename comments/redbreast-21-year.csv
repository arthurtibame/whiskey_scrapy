This tastes like concentrated peach juice, that's the predominant flavor. Some smoke, some toast, some toffee, every sip brings something else. Some lingering bitter chocolate. Long finish.

5.0,"Redbreast 12 was the first distilled spirit that nearly brought tears to my eyes. That moment where any of us destined to fall in love with Aqua Vitae say ""oh I think I get it"" . It's not as complex as a knock out single malt from the Scots but it is instead its own road. If a good scotch is the smartest guy you know that is as comfortable discussing politics as they are the fine arts and always seems to know a little bit about everything; then the Redbreast line up is your buddy that's always well dressed and polite and is a man of a few, carefully considered words. (For theatrical affect he's obviously wearing a woolen Irish sweater and a tweed cap). This 21 year old is the finest example of that. It's clearly Redbreast but it is the head of the family/older brother that's making the call on where you're going for dinner. It is so bold and reassured of itself that it commands your clear attention. On the nose it's dried fruit, and leather. On the palate those are there as well but a pine/menthol note comes through midway and sticks around through the finish. Lovely, satisfying Pot Still mouthfeel. Creamy and pleasant. The finish is medium long in length with more dried fruit (fig?) to go along with that spearmint pepperiness. This is very unique stuff, it tastes like nothing else. Highly recommended. 98\100. What can I say he's not your showiest friend buts he's almost certainly your coolest."

5.0,"It’s the Redbreast challenge: can anything be better than their 12yo cask strength? Hefty price tag aside, the dram seems innocuous enough: orangey-amber, smelling of hay, honey and just a hint of turpentine. The flavour, though, is so stunning in its length and complexity it’s difficult to unravel it all. Less fiery than the 12yo, it doesn’t call for water but benefits from a drop anyhow. Peachy sweetness is followed by dried fig fruit, then darker notes still: black licorice, pipe tobacco, spiced rum. Fabulous though it is, I have to admit it: I’d rather have four bottles of 12yo CS than one of this. Then again, each sip of this extraordinary Irish whiskey lasts so long, the bottle will probably last me a lifetime."

5.0,"Nez: des épices d'automne, du citron, du sirop de fruit en canne et du sherry.

Bouche: bleuet, abricot, pomme verte sûre, cuivré, très très doux, épice de cannelle plus effacé.

Finale: moyennement longue, sur ce gout cuivré-fruité et des notes de vieux sherry.

overall: le bouquet et complet. Très complexe et gouté. Une texture bien grasse et gouteuse qui fait ressortir les arômes de façon prononcé. +1 pour l'originalité aromatique. Tout simplement fabuleux... Je crois que cette bouteille plaira autant à l'amateur débutant que l'amateur avancé. Peut-être que les Sherry-bomb lovers seront déçu des notes ""trop"" subtile du sherry.  Peut-être que les amateurs de tourbe n'y verront que peu d'intérêt. Moi, j'y vois une oeuvre d'art en bouteille, un équilibre parfait d'arôme sans domination, une fraicheur et une douceur qui n’affaiblis aucunement le portrait aromatique. Simplement le meilleur Irish que j'ai goûté jusqu'à ce jour. Bref, je ne peux que donner un minimum de 98%."

4.5,"I had long awaited to finally taste this dram. The incredibly famous Redbreast 21yo was supposed to be the most chocolaty-amazing whiskey in all the land. 

I was at an Irish Bar, and this was the most expensive glass of them all. $50 was the price to pay for this tasting moment. And when they brought the whiskey, i felt it didn't have the aroma i expected. Actually it took a few minutes to open up... then it was wonderful.

Well, lets do this:

On the nose: Vanilla mixed wirh grain whiskey. Coffee. Burnt caramel but not as creme brulee.  Cocoa. Dark chocolate; Peanut butter, Definitively buttery. Butterfinger chocolate and Dulce de leche. Such a treat. 

On the palate, explosion of chocolate and Butter. Maybe peanutbutter. Very thick, lots of character. Aftertaste is spicy with clove notes. 

Overall this is a fantastic dram, BUT YOU MUST LET IT BREATH. Its overall sensation is that you are having a Milka Caramel Chocolate. 93 out of 100. Sláinte!"

Nothing “wrong” with it per se but to me it ends up a bit dull and without any specific redeeming qualities that would justify its premium. 
Tyrconnell 16, RB12CS, Powers Johns Lane, and Green Spot are all Irish bottles I prefer to this, and all are significantly cheaper."
5.0,"Nose: Very rich.  Some honey, vanilla, even some peppermint. Varnish as well, which has never smelled so delicious. Lots of fresh stone fruits here. 

Palate: Wow.  Delicious oily mouthfeel.  This is a flavour explosion. Hard to even keep track of everything going on here. Prunes and ripe plums, cinnamon and black pepper as well coming through. Tons of cereal notes. 

Finish: Long chewy finish with lots of cereal notes. Nice tannins linger on the sides of the tongue. 

This is a spectacular whisky.  I'm a huge fan of Redbreast 12 but this is a different league."

5.0,"This gorgeous Irish whiskey is liquid gold or melted sunlight in both taste and color (whichever metaphor better strikes your heartstrings.) And exceedingly thin viscous legs dance slowly down the glass.

The nose is overall fruity and floral with notes of honey and grass, orchard fruits, orange, green grapes, and salted caramel.

The palate has a creamy mouthfeel and is very fruity with notes of tangerine, sweet red apple, plum, blackberry jam, and cantaloupe melon.

The finish is long, with a soft black tea tannic aftertaste.

Oh my gosh. This whiskey was another treat from a friend and I am quite blessed to have been able to savor a sample. It is amazing to me what can be done to whiskey to alter the end product so vastly! I believe the saying is true, “There are no bad whiskeys, just exceptional ones.” However compared to this exceptional gem, some whiskeys don’t stand a chance! I highly recommend trying this Irish blessing and would personally love to have it again! Thank you Midleton Distillery! Sláinte!"

Palate: very interesting. Next to a sour fruitiness I got a nice pine tree resin taste. That’s new - never had that before. Also a heavy sweet cranberry jam taste, spicey cloves and some intense dry wood. 

Finish: long, a little numbing white pepper burn, a fruity bitterness like when you bite into the peel of an orange. 

A very deep and rich Irish whisk(e)y. Really something different. Even if it came across a little rough the experience is very unique and interesting."
