5.0,One of my favorite whiskies of all time. It's not overwhelming while still being distinct.

3.0,Very smooth and just a mild sweetness
3.0,"Nose and flavor are dominated by fruity caramel notes (I keep coming back to pears). Delicate and smooth, especially for a craft whiskey. I'm tasting batch #325, & each later batch I try the better this stuff is. It's among the upper tier of the new craft whiskeys I've tried, and is a very strong value at about $30. Recommended!"
2.0,"[NOSE] young, rubbing alcohol, banana, hint of vanila.  [PALATE] sweet corn, banana, fruity candy, melon, light but smooth texture. [FINISH] mild spiciness, some hints of mixed fruits, a touch of toasty bitterness, short lasting. [COMMENT] a special bottle of bourbon that worth some tries."

Way more drinkable and not quite as sweet as Elijah Craig."

3.0,Pretty sweet and smooth but more like a highland scotch than a bourbon. Really light flavors and looked young.

2.0,"Don't get me wrong, this is a perfectly acceptable pour. It's just a $7-8 pour. At this $11 price point it's weak. Very thin and wheat and corn grain driven. 2/5"

4.0,"Very light, light spice but still significant enough to add character. Very clear color, almost transparent. Not too rich but enough in the pockets."

3.0,"Lemon and honey for the nose. Smooth with not alot of heat. Little bit of pepper on the tongue, honey, and vanilla rounding out the taste. Lingering bit of honey. Not bad."

3.0,"Young and sweet. Corn dominates the nose and the palate, with hints of apple and vanilla, but this is a very delicate whiskey. Finish is peppery, quickly fading away. Would be interesting to see what a few more years in the barrel would do."

4.0,"The pears with a touch of brown sugar is right on the front. It’s smooth - very drinkable. I really like it but can see where people would want more depth or less sweet. However for me my wallet, this is a fantastic bourbon."
3.5,"Smooth, no burn. Flavorful."
4.0,"Smells delicious, as if it's hiding a sweetness.  First taste you get a hit of a familiar sweetness, a vanilla note.  Finishes smooth."

3.25,"Didn't think much of it at first, but here I am two months later trying it again and enjoying it. Nose is very light, but pleasant; taste is herbal and spice; finish nice and spicy."
2.75,Smooth but somewhat unremarkable
4.0,Kind of a weak nose but pleasant flavor on the tongue. Still light but decent. Finish stays for a second or two. This is a good $20 bourbon from TWCP. I really like this bourbon especially at this price.
