3.5,"Easy to compare to its 16 Yr sibling.   This is the hellion child meant to be taken in small bits.   Big, powerful and of course peaty.  Savor at the end of a big day.   Not ‘more’ enough to favor over the less costly 16 so won’t buy this again.   The marketing got me once but won’t get me again."

4.5,"Nose- Tropical fruits, banana, chilis, peat smoke, brine, sea salt, grassy

Palate- Sweet fruits, peat smoke, earthy-vegetal, white peaches, peppery spice

Finish- medium, oily finish with notes of peat smoke, candied fruits, and spice 


Another beauty. Love the tropical fruits on the nose, and the chili notes are unmistakable. Along with these are the usual lagavulin sea brine+ salt and peat smoke. The palate is great as well, starting out with a whiff of peat smoke, turning into sweet tropical fruits, briny sea notes, and finishing with a sweet spice. Medium, enjoyable finish, wrapping up all the flavors very well."
4.5,"Drinks way easier than the proof. Lots of smoke and peat. Some sweetness and fruit (maybe apple?) on the palate. The finish goes on and on and on. It really stays with you. Glad I got to try this.

5.0,Excellent. Smoky and peaty but not overpoweringly so. I was going to save this for a special occasion but my wife got into early! I think this bottle marks the 200th anniversary of the distillery.

4.0,"There's a meaty, umami quality to this that brings to mind a thick steak rubbed with salt and marinated in soy sauce. It's mouthcoating, perhaps permanently given that its drying embers are still humming away even though I've been nosing an empty glass for 30 minutes. Dive in, as the ABV is easily tolerated. Thanks to Pranay for the sample."
5.0,"Well, for this year's Burns Night celebration I've decided to pop open the 2015 Lagavulin 12 year old cask strength and do a comparison with the 2016 version.  Up next is the fresher vintage- the 200th Anniversary 2016:  it's 115.4 proof and is also non-chill filtered.  It's an even lighter straw color in the glass but seems a tad more oily than its predecessor.  It still makes some nice, sexy legs in the Glencairn, too.

The lemon and orchard fruits aren't as prevalent in the 2016 like the 2015- this one is more of your traditional Lagavulin.  Sea spray, peat smoke and bacon.  There's a hint of pine needles on the nose.  It's amazing in it's own right, it just doesn't seem as lively as the 2015.

On the palate, there's the typical charred oak, salted caramel, vanilla and black pepper spice.  It is noticeably sweeter than the 2015 and is an excellent change of pace when doing them side by side.  The big ABV is still all up in your face, as well.  The campfire fades a bit quicker and the finish is shorter, too.  The burn subsides and leaves you ready for another taste.  It's equally as amazing as the 2015.  Great stuff.

These two examples of the 12 year old cask strength are wonderful.  I think I prefer the 2015 just a tiny bit more because of the lively citrus notes on the nose.  They are both solid 5 star drams and excellent examples of Lagavulin single malts when they are at their very best.  Again, Happy Burns Night 2017, my friends.  Thanks to my friend, Pranay, for providing this delicious sample.  It allowed me an amazing chance to review both vintages side by side.  It really was a win/win for me."

5.0,"Been looking forward to tasting this 12 year old.  The 16 is a quality, peaty standard.  The DE has is at another level.  It seems that Lagavulin can do no wrong.  And once again, yes, they prove that they can do no wrong.

Pour and nose.  A lovely honey sweetness, dried apricots, the ever-present Islay peat, brine, maritime start the journey.  As more time passes, an earthy, mineral side shows itself, along with iodine, and, eventually, surprisingly and almost oddly, bubble-gum notes.  While nosing, I usually try to envision where I would be; what the nose paints in the minds eye.  The nose, here, transports me to a December-chilled morning near the coast with fireplace smoke, from fires warming nearby houses, loom in the air.  An incredible opening.  The mouthfeel is thick, heavy and oily.  A spicy burn similar to jalapeno sauce (not the flavor, but the sensation) is all around and is warming.  Once you get past the spiciness, the sweeter side of brown sugar starts to be drawn out.  Charcoal, smoked-meat, pine resin, iodine and black peppercorns all swirl about.  Once you finally swallow, you are left with a long lasting finish of bitter lemon rinds, oak, iodine (again) with a cigar-ashy foundation that never seems to fade away. 

This is worthy of time.  Thoroughly enjoyable for those who like the smoky Islay style. Full of a variety of flavors from nose all the way through the finish.  Tuck yourself away for a wee bit of time.  Sip. Reflect. Enjoy. 

Pranay, thank you for the opportunity for a sample.  One of the best I have had.  I must find this one for my collection.

4.0,"Had when thoughts turned to whisky with me mate Shano at The Guildford Hotel for Jenna's 30th. Cask strength and had this one rocked. Happy that Shano loved it, might have another recruit. Very good and seemed like it may have even had the 16 covered too which is saying something but I'm not quite sure what"
5.0,"Lagavulin can do no wrong! Man, this is outstanding stuff. Start to finish there's very little to reproach it, and so smooth, especially surprising considering the ABV. If I had to analogize it to the point of bastardization, imagine grilling pineapple slices on a charcoal fire. Or here's a better one: picture having a cigar and a Jolly Rancher candy in your mouth. Yeah there's peat, smoke, salt, and tropical fruit notes, but there's nothing special or remarkable about that. What makes THIS EXPRESSION so successful is the perfect union of all these flavors into something wonderful and unique. I can't rave enough."

5.0,"My first cask strength Lagavulin, and it was far from disappointing. I could smell the glass 15 feet across the room. You get a ton of peat here, but it wasn't as ""earthy/smokey"" as the 16. Was I missing anything? Not at all. I gained a touch of light fruit and smooth malt. Some ash qualities too, but not at all off putting. A very, very nice glass I enjoyed more than the Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength. Pricey if you can find it still though! 

1/27/2018 - Re-review! I had to do a double take on this proper bottle. The first notes on the nose I got were cotton candy, bananas, and bubble gum. Sweet and strange, but it looks like the distiller reviewers got a similar vibe. The palate is intense and bring tropical coconut, pineapple, and sweet cream along with the peat. This finish from the cask strength goes on forever and I love it. Still a solid 4.75. The only thing they could add is some sherry or spicier notes, but I am quite content. The theme to the dram should be a powerhouse. I am thinking ""Bonded by Blood"" by Exodus."
5.0,"This dram was my wife's pick at Shebeen's, an Irish bar with a hell of a scotch selection in Vancouver.  The appearance, nose, and palate of this scotch are a bit surprising in that they revealed to me a close kinship between Ardbeg and Lagavulin's products that isn't as readily perceptible in Lagavulin 16, where age has transformed the spirit into something more distinctive.  I loved this little insight into youthful Lagavulin's Ardbeggian indiscretions.  The nose has a good deal of lemon or citrus on it to complement a heavy dose of smoke, like Ardbeg 10.  There's also a buttery, Chardonnay echo, and the distinct aroma of toasted rice (Asians in particular will appreciate this scent, it's the smell of the rice at the bottom of a metal rice cooker that gets a little more burnt).  Very lively and complex nose.  The palate again for me was a dead ringer for Ardbeg, and if you'd told me it was a higher ABV bottling of 10 or a version with a few more years of aging, I'd buy it (the resemblance is akin to that between 43% Laphroaig 10 and 51.5% Laphroaig Cairdeas 2015, which was aged an extra 20-21 months).  The finish is the star, as there's an explosion of dark chocolate and espresso, with some sweetness and cream.  Imagine going to a restaurant and splitting a lemon tart and tiramisu.  I also get how that smoky, slightly herbal flavor could taste like tea to some at the very end.  This bottle is expensive, but it falls into the worth-a-splurge category for me."

5.0,"Have family over this weekend, so we just opened this 2016 Diageo Special release.  I think ""special"" means ""we'll charge you more for a lower age whiskey"".  The 16 is about $80.  I paid $90 for this.  Something wrong with that logic...but anyway, is it worth it?  Let's see.  From the nose, it's really the younger sibling to the 16.  Stronger aroma.  If the 16 gives a whiff of the briny splash of the ocean wave, this gives you a hard smack.  Nothing gentle about this.  First sip lemons and salt, followed really quickly by grapefruit and Kerala peppercorns.  ( Kerala ones are fresh 'green' taste with heat).  Wow---ends really strong.  Like when you walk into a really cold room, and turn on a wood burning stove.  You almost feel the embers in the back of your throat.   This is good, but not for everyone.  If you don't like the 16, you'll hate this.  If you think the 16 is for acne pimpled Boy Scouts, this is right up your alley.  Will grow some hair on your chest...even if your genotype is XX instead of XY..."

5.0,"Nose: peat smoke! Some fruits come afterwards, apple, pear, etc.
Taste: pepper! Brine, fruits, malt and more pepper! Then you can feel the smoke afterwards.
Aftertaste: long! Some said the 2015 version is more balance but i like this for the extra peat and peppery taste. 92/100! Quickly grab one!"

5.0,"I believe this may be the palest dram ive ever seen, this must be what most 12 year olds really look like without added coloring... non chill-filtered and near cask strength to boot, perfect craft presentation!

The nose erupts with sweet charcoal, cherry-cola BBQ pulled pork, toasted seaweed and fresh sawn split-rail fencing (a different milieu entirely)...

Without added water the palate shows alarmingly sweet and intense with a rush of winter spices. Tempered down closer to 40%: stewed apples and clove.

The finish applauds with fresh pine and it's resin, smoked citrus, even prickles of cracked black peppercorn, but toasted malt runs furthest. 

Surprisingly syncopated to the standard 16 year bottling! Honor due for the sample, as usual, to our psychotherapeutic Pranay (AKA: PB&J Minnesota Honey-badger). 

Dry glass: freshly turned earth."
4.25,"It’s time for me to come out of the closet. I’m sure somebody, somewhere may think of me as a suave connoisseur of fine whisky, but I’m here to tell you this is simply not the case. As a self-indulgent whisky swiller, I typically drink from a cylindrical vessel some might describe as a small ice bucket.  Of course, I do have a Glencairn tasting glass that gets used for official business, but this is seldom needed. In addition, my receptacle is usually filled to the brim with ice. I know, to some, this might seem sacrilegious, but I can assure you this methodology has been born out of necessity. You see, my whisky is often consumed alongside a Cohiba Esplendido, and anyone familiar with a tightly wrapped Cuban knows they require a lot of attention to stay lit. Now, our cigar club gets together most Wednesday nights, and our gracious host believes the concept of ventilation is overrated, so seeing each other from across the table is near impossible. Given these circumstances, one’s mouth can feel like a LaFerrari revving at 9,250 rpm and air cooling just doesn’t cut it. I know Jim Murray’s Whiskey Bible rates whiskies based on 4 criteria: nose, taste, finish, & balance, but I would like to recommend a 5th category called “resiliency,” because my whisky needs to finish through a pound of ice and a Cuban smokescreen. I need a good amount of oil and water to keep my engine running smoothly and my go-to, Lagavulin 16 on ice, does this for me. After finishing the drink, I will add half a bottle of Poland Spring’s water to the spent ice and enjoy the best glass of peated ice water that money can buy and the only way I‘ve found to produce it. It’s not easy solving all the problems of the world in one short get-together, but we will continue to do our best for your family’s sake and the sake of mankind for as long as humanly possible.  Oh….by the way….the Lagavulin 12yo is divine and very similar to my review of the Lagavulin 8. Of course, it comes in a little hotter with a natural cask strength ABV of 57.7%, but who’s complaining……Enjoy!"

5.0,Complex. One of my favorite.
5.0,"Nose- Fruity notes of pineapple and melon come through immediately followed by vanilla sugar, smoke, and the smell of the ocean. 
Body- Pineapple continues with the vanilla sugar. Smoke is always present but noticeably lighter than the 16 year. This allows the fruit to come through more here.
Finish- The finish is long, but less so than the 16 year. The fruitiness gives way to sweet straw. The smoke becomes more noticeable on the finish and slowly brings a conclusion to an excellent dram.
Note- While this definitely has the qualities of the Lagavulin 16 year, the equalizer knobs are adjusted dramatically. The sweet fruitiness gets turned up while the smoke is turned down. The meaty hickory smoke of the 16 is basically absent here. I like this a lot and am happy to have this in my collection. The 16 barely edges this out because I enjoy the longer finish and increased smoke."
