2.5,"Summerton Virtual Whisky Festival sample.

There’s a lot of upfront citrus in this whisky, which initially gives quite a sour flavour, however it quickly develops into quite a nice sweet spicy dram.  The finish stays spicy but fades back to the initial sour citrus notes.  Overall, it’s a pleasant enough as a dram, but not very memorable."
