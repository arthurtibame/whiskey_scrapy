3.0,This is a decent Highland Malt at a reasonable price.  Nothing spectacular here but  non chill-filtered and not colored at all.  Think the older Balblairs are quite good.  This expression feels a little underdeveloped but worth a try.  Not a very common malt in the states so if you see it and are interested I would pick one up.  Easy to drink and not very complicated - so a good malt for someone who is just getting started but wants to step away from the traditional lowland or speyside malts.

4.0,"This scotch is a cut above the usual 10-12 year Highland malts, which blur together in my mind.  It has a country breakfast basket of scents:  apple, malt, jasmine, honey, and vanilla.  The taste is sweet pomegranate and apple, and some wheat beer, cereal grain combination.  The finish is sweet but has some traces of smoke or rubber, almost as if there's a tiny bit of peat drying to the malt.  It's not hugely complex, mostly just sweet, kind of a classic ""session"" scotch.  Still, it's solidly ahead of Glenmorangie Original or others in the same weight class."
