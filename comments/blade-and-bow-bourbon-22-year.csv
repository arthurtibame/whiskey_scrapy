4.0,"very smooth & easy to drink, leaves a warm feeling in your chest for awhile. Not particularly bold or flavourful, I was expecting more flavor for the price. But overall still very good."

3.0,"Great nose, very sweet, with brown sugar, caramel. Almost smells like creme brulee. I could smell this for days. Palate is different than the nose: some floral notes, some baking spice, pepper, leather. Medium finish. 11/27/17"

4.0,"It grew on me, but I was a bit disappointed. I think in general I'm not a fan of bourbons that have spent this much time in the wood. I've had the same reaction to a lot of the oprhan barrel releases. The finish is really surprisingly short as well. It's good, but I want to compare it to the baby version to see which I like better. My money would be on the younger."
