2.0,Vanilla. Smell and taste are very different. Lingering aftertaste that turns bitter.
1.5,"Vanilla hit, then heat and spice, maybe a little smoke and salt. But it ends up tasting bitter after it sits in my mouth, and not in a good way."
1.75,"Thin flavors headed by vanilla up front, followed by lingering bitter aftertaste"
2.75,"Faint fruity, grape smell. Mostly oily, slightly herbal. Bitter aftertaste."
1.5,"Smells fruity, but tastes a little vanilla- a little bitter. Oily"
3.5,"Some peaty smoke. Most flavor is front tongue with more alcohol burn than ABV would imply. Not great, but Nice enough to try a second offering from Lakes."
