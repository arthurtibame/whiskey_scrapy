4.0,"As another Sunday closes out on this warm summer evening (and now bitter cold winter), I thought it would be a good time to open this bottle while listening to some country music by the pool/fire.  Soft, fruity nose of ripe, sweet pears with hints of apricot, honey, lemon citrus with and floral notes. A sweet potpourri of aromas.  As it arrives, you are delivered,on a soft palate, an initial wave of brown sugar.  As the brown sugar diminishes, white pepper and a skosh of cherry are present.  It finally departs leaving the mouth with a quick burn giving way to spice and lemon zest.  Over time, this whisky becomes wonderfully sweeter; as if a teaspoon of sugar was stirred in. A beautiful, soft dram that is made for a warm and lazy summer/cold winter, with all the elements of a summers day. Wonderful. [89/100][Opened: 7/12/15; 2/14/16]"

4.0,"This 10-year-old has a zesty nose—orange and lemon are followed by other fruits, including green apple and a touch of banana.  This zest carries through into the palate and is joined by fairly sour but slightly sweet notes (a hint of butterscotch and cake icing?).  Surprisingly complex for something so young."

3.0,"Balblair : 2002 1st release, a no age statement single malt scotch whisky hailing from the Highland region. Price $60.00 Sampled 12/3/15 with 1.25 teaspoons of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.
  
  Aroma - Grapefruit, green apple, lemon, orange, raspberry jam, light wood sap, lime leaf and mint.
  
  Taste - Lemon, sherbet, woody, lightly sour, malty and bittered honey.
  
  Finishes with a medium lingering flavor and long lasting burn.
  
  Final score : 3 / 5, wouldn't buy this one again, not because it's bad, it's definitely interesting and engaging, just personally don't care for it too terribly much."

1.5,"Gotta love the NAS comments, though I guess technically I don't know exactly how old it is could have been a December 2002 distillation and a january 2012 bottling and it's only 9 years vs the more likely 10.

Anyway these are all over kentucky and in the 30-40 buck range. Hard to pass at those prices. 

Nose - delicate vanilla, citrus, herbal notes. I get pears for sure over crackers and vanilla cake. 

Taste - a bit of herbal and vegable notes give it a touch of bitter, but after that it's all vanilla, apples, pears, toffee, and goodness. 

A moderately complex dram that really just does one thing and it does it really well. There's nothing special about it beyond the low price. If you're looking for a cheap scotch and like exclusive bourbon and spirit forward whisky, this is a great example. If you want anything special well this isn't that.

Scoring a 1.5 but if value is something you care about, I am pretty sure I've seen this under the 40 I paid and with price in mind this would considerably move up my list. Old Pultny of course you buy 10x out of 10 before this."
