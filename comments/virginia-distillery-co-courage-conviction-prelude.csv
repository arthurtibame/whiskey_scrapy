3.0,"Very young. If this was 8 years old toc10 years it would be superb. As it stands, it's just cuvee sweet young corn whiskey with that alcohol burn and green taste... Disappointed for the price. Hope future revisions of this are older"

3.5 year old American single malt

Orchard fruit, caramel, butterscotch, fig, a slight nuttiness and baking spice on the palate. Some dark fruit is there, but it sits in the background and lingers through the finish.

Very smooth and well rounded. Incredible depth for the age. The Virginia climate allows for depth in several years that would take a decade to more in Scotland or Ireland.

I thoroughly enjoyed this dram.

From the VA Distillery Company website:
""Prelude: Courage & Conviction showcases early stocks of the distillery’s American Single Malt whisky, with distillation beginning in 2015. This offering is aged one season less than the inaugural Flagship release of Courage & Conviction, where the target profile is four years. This whisky is a marriage of three barrel types which showcase the primary aging casks for Courage & Conviction: Bourbon, Sherry and Cuvée casks.

The Cuvée cask is present in Prelude: Courage & Conviction and will be amplified to highlight this key component in the inaugural Flagship offering of Courage & Conviction, arriving in the Spring of 2020."""
