4.75,"What a nose! Meaty, earthy, salty and then fruitiness and sweetness. Like a piece of smoked bacon that fell into the campfire ashes but the sweet honey glaze still discernible. If you keep nosing, oranges appear. On the palate: still oranges, but put on the grill and charred. Also some pepper. And a cheesy flavor. Then back to fresh fruits...cherry? Long finish with smoke emerging again. If you like complexity and layers of flavor don’t look further and try this excellent Bruichladdich."

4.25,"At the end of WhiskeyLive, just when you think your palate is frazzled and all whisk(e)y is beginning to homogenise and veer to the median, along comes this aggressively powerful beast. It punched through the enveloping fug of the crowded room and the descending fog of bibation with a blast of diesel and blue cheese. How that combination works to deliver something tasty is obviously evidence of some sort of druidic influence (but no mainland policemen were harmed in the making of this scotch).

Best with a drop of sea salt."
