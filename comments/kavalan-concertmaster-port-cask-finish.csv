1.0,Very sweet - honey and strong spice flavour. With smoke But not in a very good way. The sweetness and spice overpower the whisky flavour
4.0,Amazing and fruity.
2.0,"Plum and leather, sharp and not smooth."
4.5,"Wow this is a great dram. I have heard the first ""concertmaster"" wasn't that good but this ""port cask finish"" one is very good. I was enjoying it with some friends and all had their minds blown by it. Made by 3 different port casks (ruby port, tawny port and vintage port casks), this is a sweet expression from the taiwanese whisky.

Bottled at 40%abv.

On the nose is amazing. Floral, sherry, tangerine, oranges, lemon peel, chocolate. Beautiful stuff.

On the palate, lots of brown sugar, orange candy, toffee. Delicious cloying sweet sensation.  Finish is short with a tobbacco/ashy flavor. 

Not pricy at all, (about 70$) this is something that can make you happy. Overall i give it a 93 over 100, very recommended. Slainte!"

3.0,"Unpleasant, artificial aroma.  Palate with honey melon up front, before a wave of sherry-like raisin juice floods the palate.  Tastes intensely sweet, but artificially so.  Finish can linger with spice, ginger, or bitter chocolate.  A half-teaspoon of water muddles the initial melon flavors, but highlights the port notes.  Water in this Taiwanese whisky isn't a good move.  While excelling in sweetness, the artificial-like quality of the experience makes this a one time purchase.  I am sorry, Kavalan, I wanted to adore you.

3.0,"N: spicy and sweet, tea leaves, dried plums. Not nearly as sweet as you might expect a port finish, although it becomes sweeter with time in the glass. P: nutmeg, nuts and mocha. F: dry with bitter chocolate. Tastes young, but high quality. Really nice nose."

Nose is sweet and fruity, with notes of orange, honey, lemon peel, and then banana bread and a tiny bit of mango. Palate is sweet and fruity as well, with notes of vanilla, tropical fruit, then a bit of tobacco, spice and tartness, cumulating in an oaky finish which wasn't pleasant frankly...."

5.0,"This whisky is a real delight, a real gem, after being disappointed by Kavalan Classic, this was a real surprise. Oily, sweet, spicy pepper and cinnamon, fruity, warm cocoa and caramel and finally a flamboyant toasty Port finish! I adore this, a real generous feast! I tried it thanks to Stephanie Moreno's review! Thanks Stephanie!!"
4.0,"You can tell this was aged in port casks just from the nose - that jammy dried berry quality is fairly big and obvious, along with baking spices. The palate is a berry and tropical fruit salad sprinkled with some cinnamon and clove. I liked this one; probably my second favorite in the Kavalan family!"

2.0,"Well... I suppose no distillery is perfect. I've come to appreciate so many of Kavalan's expressions that I'm a little crushed by this one's shortcomings. The nose has hints of honey and over riped figs (in an unpleasant way), with a palate that's oaked with notes of cinnamon. I wouldn't say it comes across as a typical port finished whisky - it's more winy than anything. And the finish is bitter and distasteful. This was not my cup of tea, or should I say not my ounce of spirit."

4.0,"The aroma of Port wine is very distinct and caught my attention on the first whiff. It gets a bit confusing afterwards. It is salty on my tongue, but the Distiller profile indicates low in salt and brine. It is very fruity indeed, and finishes off with the Port wine aftertaste again."

3.25,"Let's go back to the other side of the world, to King Car distillery and their Port-finished NAS whisky 'Kavalan Concertmaster'. Nosing this Taiwanese Single Malt is quite pleasant, despite the intense sweetness and spirity youthfulness. Tropical fruits, icing sugar and a touch of menthol blend nicely with honey, nuts and raisins. With only 40% ABV, the taste is rather thin, sweet and slightly sour, featuring berries, roasted coffee and a dash of pepper in its brief finish. Again, a very 'engineered' and certainly overpriced malt that didn't blow my socks off.

4.0,"complex, notably sweet, just a little spice."
2.0,"Nose - Tropical vanilla, sweet grilled pineapple, fruity red berry syrup sweet, light milk chocolate, cherry/strawberry Twizzlers.

Taste - Fairly thin, light oaky bitterness & fruity spice tingle, light bitter oaky vanilla, light red stone fruit sweet, hint of pineapple & banana.

Finish - Lingering fruity spice tingle, fades fairly quickly, fruity oak bittersweet, more stone fruit pit bitterness.

Score - 62/100

Final Thoughts - I had somewhat high hopes for this one as I've had their cask strength offerings and they were quite good. This one had an amazing nose and then apparently it just stopped there. The flavors were greatly muted and all I got overall was a general watered down bitter malt with a hint of tropical fruit. Quite a disappointment from their other offerings.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

null,"Idk about paying one hundred clams for this bottle....- but it’s really well balanced and smooth- not necessarily complex, but won’t disappoint. It’s dark looking - and regardless  of added color I still prefer a dark “scotch” - for example; Hedonism is so damn tasty but it’s color throws me way off- it looks like a Chardonnay and tastes like a beast. So, added color in scotch you say? I’ll take it."

3.5,"This one is the port cask, so a lovely deep amber colour, rich dark fruits on the nose, plenty of sweetness. There's a slight citrus edge to the aroma too, a nice addition that compliments the dark fruits nicely. At 40% there's very little ethanol going on, which is nice.
Nice mouth feel, oily and rich. Dark fruit follows to the palate, but the citrus not so much. Not quite as sweet as the nose would suggest. There might be chocolate? Finish is a bit metallic, doesn't linger, over quite quickly with that fruity undercurrent. Pretty nice"

4.75,"Nose: chocolate pudding, raspberry, coconut, baking spices, nutmeg, roasted nuts, cotten candy, and Autumn leaves.

Taste: chocolate, dark and citrus fruits, with a nut filled fudge finish.

Experience: taking a bite of a fruit and nut brownie or fudge on a cool crisp fall day.

Really loving this, it's like Bunnahabhain 12 if you added fruits and nuts. Starts with chocolate, goes sweet nutty and fruity, then finishes with a darker bitter chocolate, I'm delighted.

*Not sure if mine is the same as it is 43% abv and the bottle is much darker almost black."

4.5,"Nose: allspice baking spices, light grape or figs, malt, oak, blonde roast espresso, heavy port 

Taste: fruit cake, peach, vanilla, light oak. Finish is dense port wine. Interesting in that it doesn’t overpower the rest of the flavors as port finishes usually do. Dense cherry, white grapes, milk chocolate. Becomes malty and sour when water is added."
