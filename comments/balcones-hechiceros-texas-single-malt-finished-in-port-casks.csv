4.5,"It’s hot, but full of flavor"
3.75,"Spicy, complex"
4.25,"hard to pick up anything on the nose because of its high proof.  very alcohol forward.  slight vanilla and oak, as to be expected from a bourbon.  after I tasted it once, I got more sweetness.  vanilla and toasted marshmallow.  less oak than the first.  

on the palate, it is very tannic. it dries out your tongue immediately  After the initial taste, the whiskey begins to explode with plum and grapes.  it finished with that sweet, fruity, rich aftertaste that I associate with actual sherry, not whiskies finished in sherry casks.  the finish is long and sweet and rich.  the finish is probably my favorite part of this whiskey.  

it's a very fun and interesting whiskey.  definitely worth a taste, though I wouldn't get a bottle of it."

4.5,"On the nose heavy butterscotch, caramel, raisins, grapes.  On the palate butterscotch, caramel, dark honey, port wine influence from the 2nd maturation in port barrels. So rich and even more complexity than the original Balcones Texas single malt which I also love.  This one tops it and is one of my favorite single malts!"

4.5,"At first smell there is zero mistaking that this was finished in port casks. Sweet smell of caramel, toasted marshmallows, and raisins. At 120 proof the heat is unmistakable. However it has a rich mouth feel and the single malt comes through nicely; Sweet, strong, and a bit oaky."
