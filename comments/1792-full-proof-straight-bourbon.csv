5.0,This bourbon starts out light on the nose but don't let that fool you. The tongue finds strong oak with some carmel and oak. The finish is long and brings luxardo cherries with more oak abs mild sweetness. The maturity shows in this bourbon and deserves extra sips to discover subtle notes of cinnamon and nutmeg.

4.0,"Nose: A crisp green apple wrapped in vanilla and caramel sweetness. Oakiness. Subtle baking spices. 

Palate: Apple and caramel at the front with a vanilla sweetness softening the intensity.
Oakiness joins in the mid palate as the heat intensifies and the flavors deepens. The Finish is bold with alcohol and intense warmth. This one goes out with a bang.

Body: full

This is a really big, intense whiskey. I think this would be incredible on the rocks because of the high proof. Can’t wait to revisit it."

3.0,"Strong, straightforward flavor. Fine for mixing, boring to drink."
4.0,"I received a sample of this Kentucky straight bourbon from my bourbon guy at work. His father in law is a member of the Georgia Bourbon Society and this is a single barrel that they hand picked in 2016. 

8 years and 3 months old, 125 proof or 62.5% ABV. Natural color of deep amber and non chill filtered. This has a mash bill that is 75/15/10% corn/rye/malted barley. 

Initially the nose is a big jumble of flavors and a little clunky. Letting it settle down reveals strong cinnamon and light oak. A good amount of vanilla, brown sugar, toffee and caramel. Surprisingly fruity with red berries, baked cinnamon apples and pears. Rye bread with some honey tea notes and maybe a little nuttiness. It becomes sweeter with bubblegum notes. More vanilla and caramel towards the end. A dash of water allows for more vanilla, oak and apples to come through. 

Mostly cinnamon on the palate initially. Apples and pears come though next with vanilla and caramel. Oak and a little rye with a general sweetness like cotton candy and overripe banana. 

Full bodied mouthfeel that is hot, oily and mouthwatering. 
A long finish with vanilla, oak and a hint of mint. 

This is surprisingly easy to drink at 125 proof. A good amount of fruit and the cinnamon is not overbearing. A mostly typical bourbon profile, but less oak than I would have expected. A pretty good value at $47 locally given the high ABV. I think it would be best enjoyed with a big ice ball, but it's good neat. I do think that it would be better with a higher rye content, maybe 25-30% instead of 15. I give it a 4.25. 
Cheers"

5.0,"This is my first bourbon from Barton Distillery, which distills the 1792 lineup.  This is not quite a barrel-proof bourbon, since every batch of it comes in at exactly 62.5% ABV.  Instead, it's very high-proof 1792 that the distillery slightly waters down to get to exactly that ABV.  For about $50, it's one of the least expensive, best-rated high-proof bourbons out there.  The downside of that pricing is that there's a chance (actually a certainty) that Barton's mainly using young juice for this product.  Despite that, it stacks up just fine.  The nose has a wonderful aroma of vanilla coconut frosting, coffee and cream, and black tea.  Its flavors with each sip are intense and rich caramel and a mouthful of tannins, so the wood influence is strong.  Interestingly, there is little rye spice or grain in this bourbon, at least not much that I could detect.  1792 Full Proof has a composed finish of oak and caramel, with some stewed fruit accents.  It gets prickly and grassy at the very end, which is a flaw, but an understandable one given the high proof and young age.  Nonetheless, this represents a strong value in the increasingly crazy bourbon world."

4.25,"On the nose I get banana bread and slight vanilla. Very unusual and fruity, in an unexpected, good way; especially for the proof. Medium viscosity with a big bold flavor of banana bread, vanilla, caramel, some spice and back to banana bread. This really breaks away from the traditional bourbon flavors I’m used to. Hardly any oak, a slight char flavor with a nice hug. Finish tapers off into apple and banana with lingering spices. 

Looking forward to comparing to a store pick I grabbed for even less $. 

While I don’t see this on the shelf frequently. For the price, proof, and flavor, this is an amazing deal and quite enjoyable. I love the barrel proofs (this isn’t truly a barrel proof) but this is one of the more unique ones I’ve had. Not my favorite, but definitely some delicious juice.

Despite the proof, this is smooth and buttery with a long finish. Awesome stuff."

5.0,"My buddy @Generously_Paul sent me a pour of a 1792 Full Proof, Single Barrel that he acquired from a friend in the Georgia Bourbon Society.  This bottle was 8 years, 3 months old and was bottled way back in 2016.  I believe it was the same proof as all the Full Proof bottles- 125.  It was a deep, rich mahogany and made tons of oily legs, while leaving behind quick forming, tiny droplets around the rim.

The nose on this one caught me off guard every time I went in for a sniff:  an odd, sulphuric rotten egg note was there every single time.  I let this thing sit for almost 45 minutes- periodically going back in to see what the hell was going on.  It was there every single time.  It was very strange and funky, but once it disappeared I got everything I was expecting:  wheat bread, sweet malt, butterscotch and lightly charred oak.  I believe there was a hint of dill in there, too.  I actually started chuckling every time I went in, knowing what was coming:  wet farts.

The palate was delightful and practically perfect, though.  Toffee, chocolate and sweet wheat.  There’s a sense of well-aged wood with every sip, too.  Ultra smooth on the tongue, oily with little to no issues from the super high ABV.  Great stuff.  The finish was medium to long, warm and buttery while still being as smooth as a baby’s bottom.  I could drink this all day- if I could find and afford it, that is.

Thanks again to Paul for sending me this pour.  It truly is spectacular.  4.5-4.75 stars.  Near perfect.  Cheers."

4.0,"I have been hunting for a bottle of this for a while and was pleasantly surprised when I finally saw it in stock at my local Total Wine! Was even happier with the price point! For background, this is a limited annual release from Barton. It's the same high Rye mashbill as the standard 1792 (75% corn, 15% Rye and 10% Barley) and is aged for between 8-9 years. It is full proof, which is slightly different than barrel Proof as some water is added to bring the proof down to what it was when it was originally Barrelled. In this case that is 125 proof. Additionally this was voted 2018 Bourbon of the year at the World Whiskey Awards. On to the tasting!
Upon entry you get a big Toffee and honey smacks note. Sweet but not overbearing. Mid pallette has some ethanol, rye spice and oak with vanilla wafers. Everything is in balance. The finish is medium, drying and mouth watering. The most impressive part of this Bourbon is it drinks like it 100 proof. It's incredibly smooth. Nice warming sensation that lingers for a while but nothing else. 
Now, is this as good as Stagg Jr, ECBP or even Booker's. No it is not. However, to get an 8+ yr old Kentucky Bourbon from a great distillery, full proof for under $40, it's an incredible value. 4/5 strong recommendation."
4.0,"Interesting. Oily, buttery mouthfeel like some of my high end favorites without the sweetness that would normally come with these characteristics. Loads of cinnamon on second nose/taste. Hot and spicy. Dry, woody with corn very present. Aftertaste is a little unpleasant but not off putting. 125 proof. 3.9."

I drank this bottle in a flight with can winkle 10, van winkle 12, GTS, and 4roses 130, and it holds its own. If you don’t own this, you need to. Period."
5.0,"I am tasting a single barrel store pick of the 1792 Full Proof. It was selected by GCM Liquor in Gilbert Arizona in the Fall of 2017. Barrel #040. 
I have previously reviewed the batch product of this one and have had several store picks. I view them as one of the very best values in all Whiskey. Every once in a while a pick comes around that is a cut above and warrants it's own independent review. This is one of those times!
For background, this is a liqour store I frequent and have established a relationship with the family that owns it. One day a couple weeks back I walk in for a standard check in and mention to one of the brothers that I had tasted a recent store pick from a competing Liqour store of this Bourbon and thought it was excellent. In fact I felt it was better than there current store pick. He then tells me to come back in a couple of weeks and he will pull an older store pick that they have in storage that he says will.blow.me away. I walk away without buying anything on that occasion but I do show up a couple weeks later. As soon as he sees me he tells me to wait a bit as he goes to find the bottle. That was 10 days ago! I have had a few pours of it ( ok more like 8oz!) and find it to be outstanding! On to the notes:
 On the pallette it's so oily and bold! Butterscotch, honey and black cherries smack you in the face. It's a wonderful entry with rye spice and a hint of coffee leading the way to the oak driven mid pallette. The oak is augmented with cocoa and vanilla notes. The finish is epic and long with dried red fruits, tobacco and more oak starring. All of this at 125 proof with no dilution. The heat is only felt at the back end of the finish. 
This is one of those bottles that defies it's price point and is truly special when placed in the context of the price paid ($38). 
It's on par with some of the very best Stagg Jr batches I have had and has similar notes (note Sazerac owns both Barton and Buffalo Trace). 
Based on all this and my previous experiences with 1792 Full Proof Store Picks, I put a strong buy recommendation on them. 
For sub $40, honestly I don't know what else you could ask for! Based on that I will award this the illusive 5 star rating (please note this factors in the price point and in no way is suggesting this better than GTS, Pappy (insert rare Bourbon) or even ECBP).
Cheers All!"

N: simple - vanilla, caramel, maybe the faintest hint of banana but I can’t get it reliably. 
P:  changes as the glass sits. Cinnamon, faint spice, vibrant fruit juice. The alcohol burn is present, but surprisingly pleasant

4.0,"This review is based off of a single barrel “store pick” of their 125 proof Full Proof version.  I’m sure pretty most everyone knows this, but Full Proof just signifies the maximum entry proof of distillate that can be put into new oak barrels for bourbon.  Barton claims this to be around 8.5 years old, although the bottle makes no claim to it’s age.  This is not chill filtered.

N:  Oak, vanilla, caramel, cherry, butterscotch.

P:  Lightly oily vanilla and caramel with some alcohol heat.  Chocolate brownies, some oak and baking spices emerge as the heat dissipates.

F:  Baking spices, fading candied notes (mostly chocolate), surprisingly not much oak.

I can see why this is, for the most part, is well liked.  I remember when this 1st came out a couple of years ago.  Now you see it somewhat frequently as a “store pick” as well as their Single Barrel version.  The original release was not a single barrel, but a batch release.  So, the flavor profile of this one may be more “linear” than the batch released product, but that is probably splitting hairs.  It’s a decent drink for the money and proof - I would say."

2.5,"Reviewing the Wegmans Single Barrel store pick.

Since I last reviewed this, I have let it sit for a week. it now gets a mild upgrade. I still don't love it, but it is at least drinkable.

it has picked up interesting burnt orange and floral (lavender / Violet) notes. the balance is still off, and it is still too hot. this is probably my least favorite Barrel proof bourbon."
2.0,"In a nutshell, this is too hot and is perhaps the first bourbon I've added an ice cube to in years.

This website and BreakingBourbon did a good write up on this that that I agree with.  For the record, I tried this on my own before reading any reviews.  In any case, this bourbon is completely out-of-balance.  Way too hot and spicy with not enough sweetness or other flavors whatsoever.  Like you were making a cinnamon apple pastry but accidentally dumped the whole container of cinnamon in when the lid fell off.

Some ice made it drinkable, but it still wasn't likeable.  I promise to revisit this after it has had some time to sit open."

Lots of toffee and butterscotch in the nose. Super bright and fruity on the palate. Notes of clove, lemon zest, caramel apple, honey, and juicy pear.  No real burn until the finish after the other flavors have been presented but then hits you with some building (not unpleasant) alcohol heat. PUNCHY. Lingering finish. 

A lot of reviews I have read have labeled this one a mess. While it is kind of disjointed and has a non-traditional flavor profile, I found it strangely appealing as well. The flavors became more cohesive about halfway through the bottle.  Overall a funky and unique bourbon."

Body: firm and robust

Palate: caramel, spicy, vanilla, sweet, molasses

Finish: medium to long, warming, surprisingly long when the nose is so delicate. It’s like being tucked in by a big warm comforter. 

Note: reminds me of the saying a lady in the streets and a freak in the sheets. Wow, really good, I was expecting this to perhaps disappoint based on the nose but this little lady takes the gloves off and punches you in the tonsils. I particularly like this bourbon, it’s got balls with the high proof but gives of airs of delicacy. Noice"
4.25,"Binnys 2019 store pick. Comes off very hot out of the bottle but quickly cools off. Once I let it breathe for 5 or so minutes this took a quick turn to vanilla and baking spices. It is still hot but doesn’t drink like it’s 62.5%, and isn’t even close to what the nose lead on at the outset. Coats your mouth on the first sip. Not necessarily an ideal sipper, but damn this is like dessert in a bottle. At this price point I’m not 100% sold, but if I needed something to crack open and came across a store pick again, I think I’d be a buyer."

4.0,"For those who may not have heard, Jim Murray has named 1792 Full Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey as the 2020 Whisky of the Year in his annual Whisky Bible publication. He scored it 97.5 out of 100. What does that mean? I'm not really sure because no matter how much people attempt to explain or justify to me any type of rating or ranking system, it is simply a subjective number that is ultimately useless. To say that there is no bias when tasting whiskey is absolutely ridiculous no matter how much of a ""professional"" whiskey reviewer you are. People like certain flavors more than others as well as their ability to biologically detect certain flavors can differ wildly.
Tasting whiskey in different environments can affect perception as well. For example: having a pour of whiskey at a beachside bar overlooking the ocean will have many people perceive that whiskey to taste much better versus if they were having that pour in a dimly lit room while it's raining outside. Whiskey purists can argue that it is not how that works, however, there's much more evidence exists that shows how much a person enjoys whiskey is influenced by much more than what is simply in the bottle. So is a 97.5 out of 100 score accurate and justifiable? Yes, no, and maybe. I honestly would prefer spending my time drinking great whiskey than arguing that point.
My particular bottle is from a single barrel pick that was collaborated on by two awesome liquor stores in the Phoenix Metro area, Liquor Express and Gilbert Convenient Mart.
Mashbill is 75% corn, 15% rye, and 10% barley, bottled at 125 proof and no age statement.
On the nose there's molasses, caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, and coconut. On the palate you get much of the same flavors along with oak, leather, coffee, and black pepper and cinnamon spice. There's buttery, thick, and creamy mouthfeel as well. The finish is long and hot due to the proof with charred oak, burnt brown sugar, and candied cherries flavors. Definitely the best 1792 expression I've ever tasted.
For those who desire a numerical or quantifiable rating: I give it 5 feet 6 inches on a 6 foot scale, or 5 out 7 handlebar mustaches. Do with that what you will."

Thin, floral profile with very little to offer."
3.0,"So this is another store pick, a ladies pick no less.  I'll be honest with you for ever official full proof I see, I see 5 store picks.  So honestly, odds are you're having a store pick with this one.  

Nose - There's a dusty oak over some sweetness.  I'm not getting a lot on the nose.  It's got a very marshmallow like sweet but not too sweet thing going on.  Adding water and I'm getting hit by oak spice.  I get a bit more sweetness too.  Water really opened the nose.  

Taste - This is a much more oak dominate full proof than I can remember.  So you get the normal 1792 sweetness.  I think of it was sweet corn, and very clean and heavy vanilla (not a french vanilla or vanilla extract but a very candied clean one).  After that there's a lot of oak and oak spice.  There's 3x the oak in this than any other bottle I've had.  I also get a bit of nutty notes which again are off profile.  Water brings out more of the traditional sweet 1792 flavors.  There's still oak.  The oak is a very middle of the road one for me.  It isn't young oak, it isn't old oak, it's not overly spicy but there's spice.  I'm enjoying this different take while still being on profile of the 1792.  

I'm always a fan of 1792 and I've yet to have one I wouldn't recommend as a buy.  This is the same.  1792 full proof is the perfect 3 star bourbon.  No, it's not special or magical, but it's priced very well for what is absolutely outstanding quality bourbon. That said not that complex, not that old, and certainly not a special bourbon."

4.0,"The nose erupts with praline, barrel spice, brown sugar, toffee, with a gentle twist of vanilla and dark fruits, all mingled with a strident alcohol presence. In the palate, there’s a more pronounced nuttiness, tobacco leaf, and loads of rye spice. The finish is brief, but punchy, with a highly effervescent ethanol charging its way off the tongue as the moderate mouthfeel dissolves almost instantly, leaving behind a punch of proof heat, more rye spice and tobacco leaf, and even a slight creaminess. Further sips found molasses, honey, clove, and some other faint woody notes. Ultimately, this whiskey will rise or fall in your estimation by how much enjoy the confluence of high rye and high proof. For those like myself who are slow, pensive sippers, the marriage does well, and may offer a more viable step down from the assertiveness of say, an older Elijah Craig Barrel Proof…albeit only a step."

4.0,"Taste:  Neat in rocks glass, 1.5 oz sample. This was a Binny's pick.

Nose: (3.75) for me the nose was faint.  It had pitted fruit and honey with a bit of cereal grain.  Was pleasing but not enough of nose.  That said.....I normally nose my whisky in a glen cairn so this might have diluted things for me.

Taste (4.25)  I liked it alot.  Lots of honey and a bit of lemon poppyseed for me.  It has a sweetness without overdoing it.  The honey sweetness is very good.  My gripe is that I wiahed it were richer for the proof.

Finish (4.0): Fades to a bit o honey type taste.  Finish is a little on the short side for the proof and need I hate to say it........very smooth.

Overall:  This was a pleasantly good surprise for me.  For a cask strength it was pleasantly refined, and interesting.  A few drops of water opened up some butterscotch flavors.  I really want to try this in a different glass to see if I might have missed something on the nose."

4.0,"Seems like cask strength full proof is becoming more and more common now.  I get the reasoning: as enthusiasts, we can decide how much, if any water, to add.  You see, this is where I screw up.  I always take one sip without water, and realize it’s just too potent for me.  Then I add a bit more, and it’s still too potent.  So, being a man short on patience, I then just dump a big piece of ice.  For most folks that strategy would work, but I drink my pour over the course of 1-2 hours while watching a Friday night Netflix or Sunday GoT and John Oliver.  Now...that big piece of ice just became a glass of water with a bit of whiskey in it.   The flavor profile changed significantly.  So...I guess to make this ramble end:  this is why I prefer generally not cask strength or full proof...I’m just not smart enough to handle that delicate pipette level chemistry.  

So...this pour was graciously sent by @dubz480.  That man knows his bourbons.  I don’t think I ever had this one before, but will need to look up the regular non-CS version of it.  Without water, I had all heat.  I couldn’t manage it.  But somewhere between no water and whiskey flavored water, the profile was amazing.  Best part was the nose: aromas of toasted marshmallow, caramel and dulce de leche.  Taste changed to oak driven, a bit of peanuts, and still retaining the marshmallow.  

If the price is right, I need to look up the standard version of this.  
Thanks @dubz480 for the pour!"

The nose is slightly hot if you’re not careful and starts with honey, banana, pear, vanilla, oak and cinnamon offering some hotness. The palate is very dry with a somewhat intense heat that can almost mask the flavors of what was found on the nose. The fruity notes are very nice against the dryness, with vanilla and cherry syrup that comes out at the end. The finish is long in the sense that it leaves the mouth burning for longer than the flavors last, which is a fading dry oak alongside the fruit while vanilla and cherry are quietly in the background."

4.0,"I’ve had several offerings from 1792, and finally getting around to this one, Jim Murray’s 2020 World Whisky Award (published in 2019). We’ll see.

The nose has a decent amount of rye spice with oak, cooked red apple, baking spices, honey and brown sugar. A really pleasant nose. There is a slight dustiness that I usually get on other 1792’s, but not as pronounced.

The palate is slightly oily. I get some sweet cola, rye, brown sugar, and a little dusty empty peanut can. The tongue almost immediately feels like it’s drying out and becomes almost chalky. Not necessarily a bad thing and somewhat common among whiskies with this high of proof.

The finish has a long slow fade of the palate. Lingering heat on the sides of the tongue and throat. There’s a moment on the finish where it kind of reminds me of a Wild Turkey product.

This is pretty good whiskey. Is it the best, or my all time favorite? No. But it is very good whiskey and definitely my favorite of the 1792’s I’ve had."

4.5,"I’ve had Full Proof before, I want to see how one of my local store’s (Centerpoint) single barrel pick of Full Proof fares against the standard issue. This one is noticeably darker in color when comparing it to the regular Full Proof. Let’s see how it differs.

The nose has rye, barrel char, corn, oak wood shavings, raisins, plumbs, peanut can dust, baked bread and brown sugar.

The palate has a nice oily texture but it also dries the palate. There’s honey sweetness with rye and baking spices, cooked apples, oak and slight bitterness.

The finish is long with and initial burn that tries to come up the back of your nose. There are lingering oaky notes with rye and peanut dust.

When comparing the standard 1792 Full Proof side-by-side with this particular store pick, the store pick is really good. It accentuates the fruit notes, which I enjoy and also has more depth overall. Great job to one of my local spots in Hendersonville, TN!"

I like barrel proof whiskeys, and this is a good one. Jim Murray's Whisky Bible named this the 2020 World Whisky (meaning all categories) of the Year. An over-shoot? Maybe, but worth arguing. Distiller's lead taster probably underscored this, yet D readers seem to agree.

4.5,"$16 pour at a bar, neat in a rocks glass

I never see this in ABC stores, and rarely at bars. Even though I think they were overcharging for this considering the bottle price, I had to try it. My main takeaway was I liked this better than the reviews. At 125 proof it drank so soft, it could've been 95 proof and I wouldn't have batted an eye. It was delicate, sweet, and oh so drinkable. The finish was delightful, a combination of cane sugar, oak, and berries, as if it was finished in rum barrels. It tastes nothing like the mediocre Small Batch. I am for sure buying a bottle of this when I see it."

Taste: Apple, juicy fruit, hot pie filling, cinnamon, dark chocolate, leather.

Experience: Eating the fresh baked fruits in pie, tarts, or another treat. It's too hot to eat all of but your mouth starts to water and you bite in anyway, it is too hot but still worth it. 

It's a juicy bourbon for sure, proof hounds won't be disappointed. It does have a lot to offer, but in my opinion it falls short of some other cask strength options. But that is more praise for those than a knock against 1792, place it between Elijah Craig barrel proof and Bullet barrel proof. If that makes sense."

3.75,"Liking this so far.  Has a sweet aroma & a strong bite.  Added a couple drops of water, noticed it smoothed out a bit and seemed to have a more caramel taste to it, the bite was still strong."
4.0,"The word that popped into my head when I first tasted a newly purchased bottle of this was ‘gasoline’. The 2nd taste a week or so later is less offensive, but the flavors still have not caught up with the especially harsh alcohol punch with the short air time. I’ll give this beast another couple of weeks to improve, otherwise I will just use it to proof bump some lower proof whiskeys. A bit disappointed, but still optimistic.

Update: tried a few days later after drinking ECBP and now liking the 1792 FP. Air time seems to be its best friend. Gave it another quarter point, looking forward to its continued evolution.......

2nd Update: “what a difference a day makes”, so to speak. This dram is now showing nice layers of vanilla and caramel sweetness that were quite muted before, and the ethanol has softened a bit. This bourbon has evolved from ape to man more so than any other I’ve owned. Might be a good Bourbon to use with a decanter if time or patience not possible."

4.0,"Full disclosure.  I am a 1792 fan.  That being said, I attempted to get a bottle of this late summer/early in fall 2019 before someone deemed it, ""must try bourbon.""  Every year it's readily available... except this year.  I finally obtained a bottle from a NC ABC store and waited until New Year's to crack and share with fellow appreciators.  I have had several passes at this bottle and have now been able to offer a fair review.

Nose: Fairly heavy ethenol tones.  Standard 1792 Cherry along with other unidentified fruity notes.  Supressed vanilla and slight cereal or toasted bread.  

Taste:  Rich and viscous, but light and refreshing at the same time.  Cherry and vanilla, a bit of tobacco, and a good bit of rye spice and cinnamon.

Finish:  Medium to medium long finish with pepper and char to round it out.

WARNING... Dangerously smooth!  This dram in no way seems like a 125 proofer.  It is so deceptive and so good, a person might easily sit down to sip and not be able to stand back up.  A bit of water tames the spice a bit.  If you like the spice, forego the water.  I tried this the first time along with Four Roses Small Batch Select.(review to follow). The much lower ABV Four Roses felt much hotter and  was actually very harsh in comparison without a cube.  The 1792 Full Proof is nothing short of outstanding, especially at $45.  I would not consider it, "" bourbon of the year"", but it is good.  However, to my recollection, I think I prefer the 1792 Single Barrel store pick I was drinking on last summer.  The difference I believe is the slightly thinner profile of the SB.  This is most likely due to the lower proof.  Given a slightly lower price, and MUCH easier availability, the SB would be a given.  If you are a proof hound, I highly recommend the Full Proof."

4.75,"Simply a masterpiece from 1792. Very sweet nose with notes of vanilla, fruit, and spice. Notes of fruit dance on your tongue first, followed by a symphony of flavor featuring sweet brown sugar and vanilla. You’ll find these notes resonating in your mouth long after the orchestra’s final chords, with a finish as smooth as can be; trailing off with a hint of peat and slight smoke.

This work of art 1792 calls a “bourbon” packs an astonishing amount of full proof flavor with the smoothest finish I’ve ever had with that kind of power. As a fan of high proof whiskeys, it’s hard to imagine tasting a bourbon I like more than 1792 Full Proof, but I have yet to try their other offerings. Highest rating I’ve ever given a whiskey."
4.25,"Store pick 

Nose:
Berries and cream lifesavers, vanilla ice cream, banana, baking spice (maybe clove?)

Palate:
Strawberry and banana, butter, same baking spice as the nose

Finish: 
Long, starts off with the same bright berry from the palate and fades into a darker cherry 

Overall:
The most unique bourbon I've ever had. Very bright and fresh. The only thing missing for me is a darker (caramel, brown sugar, molasses, etc.) element, but for $53 I'm extremely happy with it!"

Mid palate there is rush of Vanilla, Toffee, and a bunch of barrel char. It’s a full deep barrel flavor that allows some Clove and Cinnamon to shine through. A good Kentucky hug results in the finish that is long and allows you to pull all the flavors that you get from the nose and pallet. At times you can actually pull banana bread from the finish. It’s awesome if you like bananas. This full proof was selected by Star Wine and spirits in Wellington, Fl. I enjoy it greatly but I feel it falls apart with ice or water as it becomes tannic and sour. It’s an otherwise great experience as a full proof bourbon."

3.5,"-On the nose: Some banana right away then marshmallow with grain cereal notes coming through like smelling a bowl of lucky charms and vanilla ice cream followed with a delightful cigar/tobacco scent and it all comes together nicely. Letting it breath will help get past the proof of this if you’re keen on getting to the scent profiles. 

-Palette and Finish: black pepper and baking spices up front with the proof getting right in your face, but it’s welcomed. Banana and grains from the nose come in and the finish burns through with the spices and tobacco. 

The proof is hot and wonderful. You feel every bit of the 125 proof with this. If it’s too much, add a bit of ice or water to soften it up, but don’t let the proof keep you from trying this. I would say it’s not a “must own”, but is a “must try”."

4.25,"Classing out the top of the standard 1792 lineup we come to the Full Proof, this is the top of the line heavy weight, and the filtering and aging are apparent in how smooth this high proof liquid actually is.  So rich it almost has a soupy thickness to it.

The sugars are viscous, candy corn to go with the well ripe banana, some minor vanilla and caramel notes as well, but what really makes this bottle stand out is the just notable lemon sour mash that offsets all that sweetness.  It really makes for some incredible balance that along with the very recognizable Barton wood nibs are a great representation of what the Barton's distillery is really all about.   You can find traces of this in the SiB and the 100proof BiB but it only truly delivers at it's best in the Full Proof offering.   With only some mild ethanol heat in the finish, to be expected, the sweet corn treat winds it all down nice and smooth.

With enough bourbon sugars in the bottle, a splash of bitters and a cherry are really all that's lacking to have yourself an old fashioned.  Now that these bottles are becoming rarer, you likely might have to pay more for one,  but if you spot a good deal or just want to treat yourself to the best Barton's has to offer, don't pass on the 1792 with the black neck wrapper.  Cheers!"

4.25,"There isn't tremendous complexity, but there is good complexity with a big richness plus some nice wood and other bourbon flavors. It isn't fruity, but it is tasty and a great bourbon that easily surpasses 1792 Single Barrel by multiple points. This is a bit better than. Booker's Country Ham and rivals Belle Meade Reserve and Booker's Shiny Barrel. Yeah, it's woody and spicy with plenty of vanilla and some cherry and a high ABV. It tastes really good. This is a prime bourbon, especially for the list price. At a marked up price, it becomes more in line with Booker's and Belle Meade Reserve, but at list price it is a steal! Direct comparisons clearly indicate that this is a 19. It doesn't have that scotchy complexity of McKenna 10, but it does have more richness and classic bourbon flavor. Huh, McKenna 10 sure tastes like an older grain scotch that was aged exclusively in bourbon barrels. This, on the other hand, has more of a Russell's Reserve Single Barrel flavor. That cherry really does come through, but so do the other flavors. Russell's Reserve has a bit more chocolate and is also a tad harsher somehow. I like the richness of Russell's in comparison. This is really more classic with more spice (somehow) mixed with a lot of vanilla and more cherry (also somehow). It's a touch comparison given their high ABV after making so many other Comparisons. Wild Turkey Rare Breed 58.4% has clearly higher ABV - it's harsher, though it has plenty of fresh cherry mixed with prunes and maybe a couple other dried fruits. I prefer the 1792 with its more traditional about and added smoothness despite its ABV. This is a very nice dram at a great price (if you can find it at list price), even relative to Wild Turkey Rare Breed 116.8. I don't think that I would have rated this whiskey of this year, but I do see how Jim Murray placed this near the top of all whiskeys. This rates favorably with even behemoths like William Larue Weller and George T Stagg. For the price, this is the obvious choice."
