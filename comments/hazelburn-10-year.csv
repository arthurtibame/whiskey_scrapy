null,"Smooth and rich whisky. Lots of fruity, vanilla and honey flavours, just had a small sample of this during whisky festival but I will for sure come back to this (and probably rate it a 5/5)."
3.25,"Nez sucré et vraiment iodé, un peu acidulé aussi. On sent la rencontre entre le malt et la brume marine. Mais un je-ne-sais-quoi de dérangeant, comme une odeur d'écurie.
En bouche, c'est léger et subtil, iodé et assez jeune, avec quelques arômes de fruits exotiques, comme un vin blanc doux. Rondeur ""intéressante"".
Bonne finale sur la palais, agréable."
4.25,"Floral and fresh with sweet malts, great depth and long finish. 

Smoke on the front but soft on the palate. Very dynamic."

HOT, underwhelming mid palate, green apple."

3.0,"Light notes of dried fruits, vanilla and a bit of nuttiness."
4.0,"Cooked pears, aged oak and honey on the nose. Oily mouthful, with a delicious combination of toffee, lemon zest, cinnamon and aniseed spices on the palate. Relatively long, smooth and creamy finish with a slightly herbal aftertaste. Overall, this is a light, easy-drinking, but also fairly complex whisky. Very good."
3.0,"We return to the Campbeltown Chronicles with this minature picked up at the Cadenhead store in London. It has a lovely nose of pine and mint, almost a rye bouquet. Hints of Vicks inhaler - you can clear your sinuses with this one. Sweet and oily in the mouth. The tangy finish is reminiscent of tom yum soup with a hint of dark chocolate -- is there a Thai dessert that captures that combination? Water brings out more mint on the palate, but it doesn't stand up well to too much dilution. Let's score this: nose 2.5/3, mouth 2/3, finish 1.5/3, bonus point 0.5/1 for balance. So 6.5/10, just a tad below four stars."

4.5,"Nose: Rustic and elegant with malt, fruit and earth aromas. There is a hint of honeyed peat smoke along with toffee, tobacco, leather and the funk of a sweetly decaying compost heap. In the background there is a faint brininess and some very heavy, earthy vanilla.

Palate: Rich, creamy, almost oily arrival with standout notes of vanilla, malted chocolate and stem ginger preserved in syrup. In the development apple, pear and lemon appear along with toffee, nuts, and stone fruits. There are also deep herbal notes, a touch of hot spice and a fleeting, almost ethereal smokiness.

Finish: Long. The creamy character of the palate turns delightfully waxy, almost like honeycomb, but a hint of flinty minerality prevents it from becoming cloying.

Considering Hazelburn is Springbank's unpeated and triple-distilled persona it's intriguing that there is so much gentle smoke wafting about the sidelines. It's a very old-fashioned and uncompromising single malt, but it's not hard to strike up a friendship and once you get to know its personality you'll gravitate back to it all the time.

The nose is so ""big"" you can almost get lost in it - I can nurse a dram of this for hours, just nosing it. It has an endlessly fascinating, almost farmyard character, but it never ceases to be elegant and refined.

I usually enjoy this whisky neat, but it is also responsive to dilution - a small dash of water opens it up and some hidden sweetness and subtle fruity notes from the barley are revealed, but don't add too much.

Like all Springbank whiskies, this seems to be more mature than the official age statement - it's more like a 16 year old from anyone else. The official score on this site does not begin to do it justice - maybe it's a typo and it should have been 92? That I could believe.

 ""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

4.0,"I was pleasantly surprises at the amount of maturity I found with the Hazelburn 10 despite being relatively young. The flavour was truly delicious and well-balanced - even blind-tasted you know you're having something from the Hebrides (or Campbeltown): a touch of smoke, sweet peat, iodine, and a certain herbacious quality. The finish likewise is solid and fairly long. I truly enjoyed this!"

4.5,This is an amazing scotch. It's so delicate and sweet. It's hard to believe that you can get these flavors out of distilled malted barley. I get strong apricot on both the nose and the palate that lingers.

3.0,"Lys korngyllen. Enig i werthers og pærearomaene, med sitronskall, krem og noe syriner og timotei bak. Bakt eple og pære.

Lett og mykt anslag med en noe spiss alkohol som stikker litt mye, men er veldig forfriskende, lang og ren. Fruktig i avslutning med litt lavt råvarepreg kanskje. Søtt råvarepreg og noe limete tekstur. Trekker litt for pris og råvarepreget."

3.5,"This is a great daily drinker. It has enough complexity to keep me interested but doesn’t require much attention. No need to let it air out for a long period of time or play around with water, just able to pour and enjoy. 

On the nose, I get apricot, caramel, and hay. 

On the palate, I taste kettle corn, sweet cream, and touch of wood spice. 

The finish is oily and mouth coating. 

For $65ish, you really can’t beat it. I would probably still grab Springbank 10 over it but still great."

4.0,"Nose - Spicy honey, white pepper, hay, apples, light caramel, spicy sweet dough

Taste - Sweet honey, goji berry ""funk"" sweet, green apples, caramel, light sweet ""herbal"" notes, grassy, gentle heat

Finish - Lingering honey/caramel green fruit, baked apples, light sweet green herbal funk, vanilla

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - So I get what they mean by the ""funk"" in that it's kind of herbal, kind of grassy, but it works. It's there to be different and it's not off-putting but adds a different perspective & flavor profile to the standard ex-bourbon cask matured malt. It's got a nice balance, good mouthfeel, but I don't think this would appeal to everyone as I can see how the herbal/grassy ""funk"" could be offputting to others, as subtle as it is. I'm now interested to see how this changes when aged in various casks.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not this one"

3.5,"Nice, light vanilla, oily lemony salt.  Not a bad drop but similar to Springbank 10 its older and diverser brothers are just so much better. Def my least favourite Hazelburn. But better than the SB 10 by a half mark. 3.5"

4.25,"In the glass we find a pale, almost white wine distillate, very delicate.
On the nose, the profile is soft, sweet and fruity: citrus, apple, yellow fruit. There is also a light spicy note, which breaks the placid olfactory nature, accompanied by honey and vanilla.
On the palate, with cordial vitality, the alcoholic boost revives the score, which becomes more cheerful and lively, acquiring creaminess and substance while repeating the olfactory melody: lots and lots of fruit, with the predominance of the apple and the accentuation of citrus and pepper, wrapped in vanilla, honey and brown sugar. Very full-bodied and caressing.
The finish is medium long, and pleasantly drags the palate flavors, with a predominance of pepper."
