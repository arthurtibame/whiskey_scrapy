5.0,"Delicious, sweet and vanilla start followed with a long finish,"
4.75,"The nose is strong of sherry and raisins, as well as hints of peat and straw. The taste of raisins carry over strongly along with honey, peat and dried cherries. The finish is long and amazing with fading pepper, straw, peat, honey and raisins. The palo cortado finish makes an amazing difference."
5.0,special stuff!
