3.25,"This is my official deep dive into Jefferson’s. Feel free to skip ahead to the tasting, because there are going to be a bunch of these cheesy intros, all copy/paste.
~~~~~~~~~~
Concept:

I walk into a liquor store and see like a billion different Jefferson’s bottles, yet my knowledge of them is minimal. My perception is that I typically don’t care for their stuff, but somehow, before choosing to start this experiment, I already had six different Jefferson’s on my shelf. How did they invade my house?
~~~~~~~~~~
Methodology:

Step 1: Jefferson’s Very Small Batch. Patient 0. Where it all started? Never had it, so a damn good place to start. This one was bought specifically for this experiment.

Step 2:  Jefferson’s VSB vs Jefferson’s Reserve (Very Old Very Small Batch). I already had this one. How did this get in my house?

Step 3: Jefferson’s VSB vs Jefferson’s Ocean. Is it a gimmick? Again, how did this get in my house?

Step 4: Jefferson’s Ocean standard vs Jefferson’s Ocean wheated mash bill.  Repeat house question.

Step 5: Finished Jefferson’s. I got rum, Sauternes, and Prichard Hill. Let’s do this.

Step 6: Blind taste test with all 7. Hell, throw in Chef’s Collaboration. (Seriously, how?) So there’s 8. Can I pick them out based on steps 1-5? Are there any standout Jefferson’s expressions, or is it all marketing? The stakes are so low, the tension is palpable. 
~~~~~~~~~~
Disclaimer: 

Starting this, I don’t much care for Jefferson’s in general. There’s this weird gummy-bear-ness that I can’t shake. Hoping to find my Jefferson’s product by the time this is over.

JO Wheated, aka “Step 4”

Voyage 19, for those counting.

It’s very interesting that this wheated mashbill contains less rye than the standard Jefferson’s Ocean, because this little guy smells far more strongly of a rye whiskey. It smells salty, briny, and pickled. There’s a hint of jam on that nose, which makes me concerned, but it’s far from the dominant scent.

Body delivers on that nose. It’s weird that you can toggle the switch, alternating between syrupy sweet jelly and saltiness, but that is exactly what this calls for you to do. Some sips are so sweet it makes your jaw turn. Others taste dry and bitter with salt. Pickles too. With effort I can force myself to taste the profile I choose, though I can’t quite force both simultaneously. I have to give my tongue a break.

If I’m choosing my own jelly adventure, this finish is almost nonexistent. It’s low heat, charred oak flavor. Slightly nutty. Over very quickly. If I’m taking route 10 to rye-city, that brininess really sticks with you on the back of your tongue. It’s salty and bitter, and it lingers. Again, I can choose which finish I want by choosing the body I want to focus on, both flavors and duration. It’s freaking weird.

So this is clearly a complex whiskey, but not in the award-winning sense. It’s a true head scratcher. Wheated bourbons just don’t taste like this. If you’ve seen the optical illusion of the gold/blue dress or heard the auditory illusion of yanny/laurel, here’s your gustatory illusion. I can’t see a scenario where I’m reaching for this as a nightcap, because it’s far less pleasant than it is fascinating. Yet I am genuinely excited to inflict this on my friends and see what they taste. I wouldn’t buy this again, but I might buy a future wheated voyage out of curiosity.

As for comparing this to voyage 17: such a goal was simply an experimental design flaw born out of ignorance. 17 blows this out of the water, and it isn’t close. When it comes to tasting notes, there’s no more point to comparing 17 to 19 than there is 17 to Booker’s. They are completely different animals. Additionally, this batch does not make me reminisce about a warm sunny day at the beach. The power of suggestion does not compel."

4.25,"This is very mellow & smooth.  You can easily tell it's wheated, which I really enjoy.  I've only tried 2 of the voyages so far but this is easily my favorite. Has nice hints of orange to it as well."

4.0,Very good.  So easy to drink. Think cake with very little spice. Short finish. I would buy this.

4.0,"This has good amount of complexity due to the voyage it seems.  It won’t wow you at first sip but as you dig in the salty caramel texture and depth comes through. Great by itself and pairing with food.  Enjoyed this much better than the Voyage 17,16,15 or 12."
3.75,First sip I was genuinely like... MEH. Third to fourth sip.... clickage. Solid. Fascinating these Ocean’s are. This one seems tame. Nice vanilla caramelization going on. I’d buy a bottle.
4.0,"Great nose. Not overpowering. Sweet, vanilla tinge oily. Very enjoyable"

4.0,Overall very good bourbon. Soft notes of vanilla and oak. Soft texture and smooth drinking.
3.5,Burn but good
3.75,"Store pick.  Mildly sweet, fairly toasty.  Light brune on the tail end."
3.75,I typically prefer more burn which there is virtually none here. What it lacks in heat it makes up in being extremely smooth. Definitely a good drink. I’d prob recommend drinking it neat
3.75,"Delightful lychee and caramel corn front, creamed corn middle, and chai tea finish. Slight salt throughout, but more toward the middle."
3.0,Creamy wheated bourbon. Cream and bread with a spice on the end.

4.5,"Definetly get the vanilla that smooths out the heat/spice. VERY smooth, neat."
2.5,"Ethanol & slightly briny nose.  Palate with some spice & salty caramel.  I find the finish to be quite bitter with tannins and not all that smooth.  Short to medium finish.  Although not horrible, I’m not a huge fan considering the price point."

5.0,"This may be my favorite. I've gone through 3 bottles now. Probably won't purchase a fourth, just because of its price point of low $70s. But as smooth as anything I've ever had. Very distinctive, if not unique. I will miss this when my last bottle is gone (which may be tonight)."

4.0,"No water
Nose - sweet vanilla, slight spice
Taste - starts with strong spice, finishes as smooth vanilla.

Delicious"
4.0,Corn dust and Play-Doh on the nose. Smooth and malty with a touch of salt.

4.25,I’m not great at picking out note.  Definitely has the tropical smell with a sweet finish that lingers on your pallet.  This bourbon has no bite.  Next time I’ll drink it neat

3.0,"Earthy tobacco and wheat on the nose. The flavor is more of the same, possibly with a little hay on the finish. Smooth and moderately oily mouth feel. Not a bad whiskey, but I expect a little more depth of flavor from a bottle at this price point.

(caveat: I've recently recovered from a sinus infection, so my smell and taste may not be back to normal yet)"

4.0,"Store pick from Westport Whiskey & Wine in Louisville.  

Probably one to have neat to enjoy its nuances.   Cinnamon, oak, dried...but sweet citrus peel.  Coats the mouth well but doesn’t linger long.  Really smooth....a little burn.  Somewhat drying on the finish."

4.0,Gallenstein store pick. Sweet mild nose. Sweet up front with vanilla a slight burn on the back end but not all the way down.
