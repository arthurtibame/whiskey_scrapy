4.0,"Nice everyday dram and a good alternate to the Macallan 18. Not as long lasting but still offers complexity and a nice nosing experience. I taste sherry, and walnut, fresh baked goods, semi sweet chocolate. Need to give it a proper second dram and spend a good half hour on the nose for sure since it has been opened after about a month. Paid 60"

4.0,"This is my kind of single malt!  No peat.  Smells of dry fruit, malt, and a bit of toffy and citrus.  Tastes like malt heavily bathed in sherry.  Fruity, just enough sweetness to balance the savory, funky malt.  Finishes with a good dose of round oak and a bit of sweetness and malt.  Hardly any tannin bitterness.  It lingers for quite a while which lets you enjoy it even between sips."

4.0,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #2.

Nose: A robust but elegant nose that features good sherry, vanilla and dried fruit. There is also oak and spice but they are a more subtle backbone.

Palate: Raisins, sultanas, figs, dark cherries, cinnamon, orange marmalade, toffee.

Finish: Medium long and slightly sweet, fading out on the dark fruits and soft oak.

A nice dram with good body and mouthfeel. Rich and smooth. This tasted to me very much like the big brother of Glengoyne 12 year old with all the same features rounded out and completed by an extra 6 years in quality Sherry casks. I thought it had less in common with the Glengoyle 15 year.

ADDENDUM - The above notes were based on a dram tasted at the distillery a week ago. Having just finished a miniature of it my opinion is still positive and has maybe even increased. A very nice smooth and poised ""classic"" whisky that I'd recommend - particularly to a fairly new whisky drinker who is ready to move on from introductory drams.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

3.75,"After hearing really good things about the Glengoyne distillery I noticed a 3 malt, age statement sample pack at one of the online stores I regularly make purchases from.  This pack was only $17 and included 2oz pours of the 10, 15 and 18 year old.  I figured now was as good of a time as any to give them a go.

I reviewed the 10 and 15 year a few weeks ago, so let’s move on to the eldest sample in the taster pack- the18 year old.  This one was bottled at 43% and proudly proclaims to have no added color, but I’m sure it was chill filtered.  Speaking of color, this was copper gold and will reward you with small droplets and thin, watery legs after a good spin in your favorite tasting glass.

The nose is heavy butterscotch and oak with underlying honey nut cereal notes.  Toffee and caramel chews and light vanilla round out a well-balanced and thoroughly enjoyable nosing experience.

The palate continues on with toffee and light, sweet sherry.  It’s rich and oily and provides a wonderful mouth coat while turning soft at the mid-point.  Oak tannins lead you into the finish.

The ending is medium in length with soft, lingering caramel and light vanilla and berry sweetness.

It’s a really good whisky, not too complex but not shabby either.  If you sit and savor it from start to finish you will be happily entertained.  It’s something I could sit and sip on for an entire lazy Sunday and be completely satisfied.  I’d rate it at 3.5-3.75 stars and will certainly keep an eye out for a bottle to call my own.  Cheers."

A little musty leather

3.0,"OK back for some more reviews.  Today Glengoyne 18 year. I really do want to do this side by side with a Macallan 18 but unless someone else is buying, that's not happening. I could put in next to a few other options I have but nothing else seems just right. A vs. with this however seems needed. Anyway 43%, chill filtered, and non colored. They got 1 of those 3 right. 120 bucks puts this into the reasonable all be it not great priced whisky group. At 46% I think I'd give this one high marks on price but at 43 I don't see this as value. Just reasonable.

Color - not big on color reviews but as it's non colored, you can see a nice gold with some red hues. This is heavy refilled sherry barrels without a doubt and I'd guess American oak as well.

Nose - First note is just vanilla, oak, and a hint of sherry. A second pull and I'm starting to see the apple some pear and some jam. Fruity but gives me more an impression of some ex bourbon barrel influence than all sherry. If all sherry there are some tired old wood in here.

Taste - A lot of vanilla, it is spicy with a lot of oak notes, and then that jam. If I didn't read this was all sherry barrels I'd assume this was slightly more sherried than the disappointing 15 year. Finishes with a lot of sherry spice notes. Finish is actually pretty long as well.

Overall, I'm a bit disappointed as I wanted more of a sherry explosion. So far the sample I had of the 25 year remains the dream I have with each Glengoyne, that I just get a less mature version of that master piece. Instead I just get very different expression with the 12, 15, and 18. All a good but when people tell me these guys are sherry bombs, well I guess they're talking about the 25 and perhaps the 21 which I've yet to find a bottle of.

All said I'm giving this a 3 star rating. The finish is so long and lingering that it pulls up the whole rest of the issues and brings it to a 3. Without that finish I honestly could have been close to a 2 star which I believe is what I gave the 15."
4.5,"Nose is pleasant, fresh feeling, light tobacco and leather notes, with hints of soft oranges and dried fruits, specially raisins.
Palate is rich but very smooth, wonderful notes of soft vanilla, apricot and honey.
Finish is a bit on the short side, fresh, candy notes, honey and butterscotch"

2.5,"This review is for a bottle from 2013.

This is a solid sherry only maturation that exemplifies how hard it is for sherry only maturations to be memorable.  Let’s discuss the 3 things I look for in a sherried whisky as it relates to Glengoyne 18:

Richness.  We look for the same indulgent things in a high end sherried whisky, which includes the dark preserved or candied fruits, chocolate, and sherry spices, in a thick and voluptuous mouthfeel.  This whisky lacks the richness I want; citrus and grassy notes are more prominent as a result.  These notes are better served by an ex-bourbon maturation.  The casks for this whisky were not active enough, and this tastes about 3-4 years younger than it should.

Depth.  This is a big issue due to the rise of sherry seasoned casks.  These casks may deliver some surprising richness upfront, but you’ll want to swallow fast before the immature base flavors appear.  This whisky has great depth, and the casks were obviously real-deal ex-sherry, rather than imposter seasoned casks.  You can hold this one in the mouth for quite a while, and the flavors are consistent.

Absence of garbage.  The main villain in sherry casks is sulfur, but there are other offputting flavors as well.  There are certain distilleries (Springbank, Craigellachie, etc.) that seem to incorporate sulfur better, and even purposefully include those notes.  Glengoyne is not such a distillery.  This whisky is relatively clean, but slight sulfur is present, and it detracts from the experience.

These days, a sherried whisky that excels in all 3 of the above areas will be most memorable for the pricetag.  This whisky is reasonably priced, but it really does not stand out like an 18 year old should.

Score: 0 (forgettable)
How much does a bottle cost: $100-120
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $80"

3.75,"Glengoyne 18 was really up and down for me. I had the bottle open for about a year but I would occasionally get sour notes on the nose. Not sure why that happened and when it did, the bottle would go right back into the closet. Overall, the nose was fairly interesting but unfortunately, it was the main highlight for me. 

Nose: Milk Chocolate, toffee/burnt caramel, and red apples. With time the caramel evolves to notes of buttery caramel and syrup. 

Tastes: Clean, rich but watery, complex, and spice. Hints of apricot and a unique finish of coconut. 

Finish: Medium and velvety 

I purchased it at Remedy Liquor for a great price. However, it seems like all the Glengoyne core range whiskies have gone up in price dramatically since the end of 2019. It's currently priced at $130. At that price, I probably wouldn't get another bottle. The nose was good but the palate and finish were nothing special."

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose it is simple but good. Cinnamon and red apples.

On the palate more of the same: honey, a very fancy refined honey and pepper. The aftertaste is cinnamon and ashy. An enjoyable dram but not one to remember. 77 over 100."

3.25,"Nose: orange, walnut, raisins predominantly. Some sherry influences with some nice and subtle oak wood aroma. 

Palate: very sweet and mild with a very nice character that originates from the well balanced cask mix. 

This whisky is really enjoyable and I definitely like Glengoynes style - I won’t be buying a whole bottle but will be keeping my eyes open for some special bottlings. I could imagine independent bottlers doing really nice things with this whisky."
3.5,"Nothing amazing. But, I'm rarely amazed by Sherried Highlands, especially those missing peat dried grain. I do find myself sipping the 15 every now and then from my bar and always enjoy it.  This definitely noses Sherry with fruit tangs and some light wood. The first taste is light on sweetness and more richness than fruit. The Sherry kicks in and clears out the richness really quickly but the remaining bitter wood, apple, and nuts gives it a welcomed richness. The finish is quick but reminds you there's Sherry. I guess what I like most about this is that it is smooth and clean and not blowing my mouth up with fake/manufactured/forced Sherry. But I also don't find much going on to keep my interest. With all that said, not worth the $109 I paid, especially with the better choices in that range. For the money, the 15 is much better."
