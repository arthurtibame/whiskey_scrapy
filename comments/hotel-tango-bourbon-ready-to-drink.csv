4.0,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 2:

When I found this bottle as the only Hotel Tango product at my local liquor store, I panicked. At the Alpha price point, my concern was that Bravo (one of my favorite hidden gems of 2018) was a thing of the past. Turns out Bravo is still alive and kicking, and this one may merely be a repackaging of Alpha, which I never had. If I can still find an Alpha in the wild, I’ll definitely do a comparison. On the plus side, ready-to-drink is not a euphemism for some premixed bull crap. This is straight bourbon.

Nose is buttery, with loads of honey and sugar. Reminds me of Bravo, but less intense.

Body doesn’t hold a lot of flavor, but the buttery flavor is there. A bit of watermelon.

Finish is mild in feel with citrus, leather, and peppercorn flavors.

If this guy had permanently replaced Bravo, I would’ve been sad but not bitter. I can tell this is HT juice, and I still respect the hell out of them. Not as good as Bravo, but solid.

I don’t know if I actually have 29 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."

3.75,"Nose: buttery and lots of caramel. Little vanilla 

Taste:  thin but sweet, a little oakey with the perfect amount of burn 

Finish:  sweet finish with smoke on the on the back of the tongue. Slightly hot finish, the way I like it 

Old fashioned: the sweetness amplifies the sugar and orange, and the burn provides the bite that rounds it out. Good old fashioned."
