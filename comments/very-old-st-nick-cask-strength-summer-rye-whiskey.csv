4.75,"Just opened. Rested in glencairn 15+ minutes.

The nose is like an old-time soda jerk! Vanilla cream soda and cherry cola are just dripping from this nose. It's got oak, cinnamon, nutmeg, and some pepper to tone the sweetness down a bit. A yeasty bread note appears after even longer sitting in the glass.

Smooth, coats the tongue very well. Starts peppery, with a burst of rye spice, that fades to sweet cherry and vanilla. A medicinal quality that I think it tows the lines perfectly between artificial cherry cough syrup flavor vs real cherry and medicinal notes. It really tastes of the two things separate. The proof really lingers and warms the throat. and there is a fair amount of tannins in this too. The finish is super long, I was still getting some lingering sweet vanilla and oak for 2+ minutes after each sip. 

Not sure exactly where this liquid is sourced from or why it's priced so high, but damn did I love this rye. It's pretty sweet, but that's my style, hence the score. Savor this one if you can get your hands on one and the price doesn't deter you."

4.75,I love hot ryes. Great heat while maintaining smoothness. Great nose. Great Oakeyness with long lasting finish. Mild pleasant bitterness. Soft vanilla and caramel flavors late.
4.25,Smells like a bourbon and tastes a lot like one too. Very little heat for the proof
4.5,"Good oak, lots of complexity. Very smooth at cask strength. Definitely worth buying a bottle"
