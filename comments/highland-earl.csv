3.25,"Although I've heard that this scotch-whiskey blend is quite 'hit or miss', I seem to have gotten a 'hit'. This 3 year aged liquor is a semi-smooth, very mellow drink with a nutty after-flavour"
0.5,"Nose: Ethanol, old tennis shoe, malt vinegar, privet, burnt brown sugar, tired oak cask.
    
Palate: Initially it has that silky texture you get from all grain whisky but little actual flavour, just a bit of sweetness. However a moment later it flares with tannic spiciness and a bit of heat. This only lasts a few seconds and then quickly dies away. What flavour it has is pretty much generic maltiness and it's all rather thin. It's not harsh or unpleasant, just dull and a bit raw.
    
Finish: Medium. Warming and slightly saccharine.
    
Highland Earl is the ALDI supermarket chain's bottom-shelf blend. It's reminiscent of Grant's Family Reserve or Castle Rock.
    
It bears a 3 year age statement and is obviously made to undercut all the other bottom-shelf blends. It's very grain heavy and the first pour from a new bottle is not particularly encouraging. If you persist you get used to it but it never becomes actually pleasant.  It's not a great mixer either, as the raw dullness of the palate shows through even if you drown it with Coke.
    
Pretty poor stuff. I'd strongly encourage anyone considering this to spend a little more and buy one of the better bottom shelf blends. The saving of a couple of bucks just isn't worth it.
    
""Poor"" : 0.5 stars"
