3.5,"Nose: very soft on the nose. you get the hints of oak right away that fade into a cherry and red berry combo. hints on vanilla and carmel become stronger the more you nose it. there is also some blueberry pie in the background.

the pallet:
super smooth on the tounge with a blast of vanilla and it fades into berries drizzled with Carmel. actually kind of sweet to the initial tongue. on the back of the toungue you feel the small burn with a hint of leather but it's still pretty sweet. a must try if you can find it"
