4.0,"30 gallon Casks, not 15. Lenexa is 15min. From downtown KC and well within the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Thanks for the unbiased reviews. You guys should stick to the facts under product description category. A name is a name. If you don't like us using ""Reserve"" then let your audience decide. Don't start us off by drawing a negative picture for everyone using your App. I love the idea of what you have going here, but seems a little biased on the part of your creators. I give your App 1 star for lack of leadership and industry professionalism."
