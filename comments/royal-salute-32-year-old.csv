4.0,"This beautiful bottle of a special Royal Salute edition has an age statement: 32 years old! That is big. 

The amazing bottle has a Crown attached to the cork. Why? Because this expression of Chivas Regal commemorates the union of the scottish, english and ireland Crowns in 1603. This is one rare and old bottle to find. 

Bottled at 40%abv, tawny color. 

As most fancy bottles, this is a very delicate, light, straightforward, easy drinkable whisky.

On the nose: banana, burnt caramel, some herbal notes and rubber.

On the palate: old oranges, brown sugar, banana, copper, dim cherry notes, prunes.

Aftertaste is delicate and spicy, with ginger, salt and clove. 

A lovely, easy dram. I give it an 87 over 100."
