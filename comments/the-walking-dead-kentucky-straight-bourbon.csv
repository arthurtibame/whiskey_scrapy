4.0,Surprisingly I really enjoyed this. Little sweet little spicy you have your regular bourbon flavors with prominent rye lurking in the back ground. They actually did a good job on this one it kinda reminds me of a store pick elijah craig with a tad bit more rye.

4.0,"I really enjoyed this! Was very skeptical due to the tv show tie in, but this is good. Sweet with a spicy red hot cinnamon flavor. Well done!"
3.0,"Bottle looks cool.  The bourbon is ok.  It’s sweet, a bit spicy, and has an alcohol burn to it."

2.0,"People will hate me, but in my opinion, this would be decent as $14.99 per bottle quality at best. But it is a novelty and owes royalties, and that's what you're paying for. Works well for mixing cocktails."

3.75,Young and spicy at the beginning with a cherry medicine note and smooth and mellow at the end
3.75,"Carmel, light bite , brown sugar"
3.25,"Disclosure: normally I would have passed on an NAS, sourced bourbon with a cheesy media tie-in, but when my local grocery store knocked this down to $14 and everywhere else in my area had it at $35, I decided to take an inexpensive plunge on this 94 proofer. 

Bright nose with standard vanilla/caramel, peach, and new leather. 

The palate brings the vanilla, caramel, and peach from the nose with minor notes of Spanish peanut skin, and maple. Very sharp bordering on ""harsh"" mint and oak bite in the mid-palate.

Short finish ends with some cinnamon and that newly tanned leather previously noted in the aroma. Watery mouth feel for 94 proof. 

This bourbon doesn't have any deal breaking flaws, but nothing about it excels either; basically it's a fast train to Boringville. Hard to rate; do I give it a rating based on it's normal price of nearly $40 or my bargain basement price of $14? Let's start by saying it is nowhere NEAR worth $40 or even $30; if I paid that for it I'd be pissed so if anywhere near that I would avoid. At $14? Quite possibly a re-buy when funds are light. I'll kind of split the difference with the rating."

3.5,Maple syrup on the nose and palate. A bit of spice and a decent finish. Actually pretty nice for a $20 bottle of bourbon.

3.0,Very nice even as a promotional bourbon it surprised me. Bought 6 bottles and will buy more.
3.0,"The palate has vanilla, honey, brown sugar, raisins and a light rye spice. 

Palate is slightly oily with sweet vanilla, rye. 

Finish is medium long with vanilla and a slight bitterness. Fairly easy to drink with a slight tingle on the edge of the tongue.

I am pleasantly surprised by this one. I had very low expectations given the gimmicky-ness of the bottle. I found one for $9.99 so I opted in for it."
1.25,Normally would have passed on the gimmick but since I am a Walking Dead fan I had to try..... hopefully if there really is an apocalypse the Bourbon is better!

3.25,"1/2 off at the ABC store. Good value at $19...

Vanilla, cinnamon caramel and rye notes.
Warm palate carries spice to finish.  Dry and woody finish with a bit more vanilla"

1.75,"Sweet banana and chili pepper sit under the ethanol cloud on the nose. On the palate the candied cherry and dried mango skins crush it, but the alcohol still rears it’s ugly head.
There’s so mush to love, but it’s a little too unbalanced for me to want more."
2.5,Found this on sale for $10 and worth every penny. Mixing recommended
