4.25,"Wow! What an interesting experience.  The rye beer barrel finish adds a creamy quality to this that sets it apart from other rye whiskies. Notes of rye spice, dark fruit, pear, apple, cocoa and cream soda in this one"
4.0,Really interesting collaboration.  The initial aroma is of hops and then the Rye reveals itself.  I think the collaboration brings a herbaceous element to both Aroma and flavor.  Not overly spicy and enjoyable.  Very glad to have tried this.
