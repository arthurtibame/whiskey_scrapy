4.75,"Neat. Neck pour.  Blast of oak and bread immediately subsided to the sherry influence.  Bright, ripe raspberries and cherries.  Profound sweetness.  Layers of vanilla and sweet cream.  Hint of chocolate.  The goes back and forth from dark notes to bright notes.

Trick and syrupy on the tongue.  Brown sugars and maple hit the tongue first, starts very dark.  Then those bright red fruits emerge followed by a hint of almond. After that the vanilla and oak.  Vanilla and oak linger and dry the mouth, which then brings those red fruits back for another round as you salivate.  Hint of chocolate emerging on subsequent sips.

Fantastic pour.  Many sherry influenced bourbons I have had stick to being light and bright.  This one hits all the notes, dark, medium and bright.  Every sniff and sip is a bit different.  One of my favorite pours of 2019."

4.0,"OK so not sure but we need someone to address the labeling. Four Gate is going to be releasing new batch a couple a year and they are going to be radically different each time. So this is the only named review that I feel comfortable reviewing this under, the other is just calling it four gate. This is a sherry rum finished bourbon. The batch 2 which I don't believe is released yet, but samples have gone out to a lot of whisky reviewers (and as a result I may have gotten a hint of what's to come)...well it's night and day different. 

Nose - waxy red fruits, cane sugar, spicy over ripe fruit. 

Taste - Oh man. Opens with heavy finishing. You get some sherry and some rum notes...berries, sugar cane, some yellow fruits and dark fruits. Then the whisky completely switches and it moves towards a very classic bourbon. I kinda feel like this reminds me of a bartons but I could be wrong. Peanuts, oak, vanilla and caramel from the bourbon. I'm getting citrus from the bourbon as well. 

I hate to go there but 4.0. This is one of the best bourbons of the year for me. I wanted to hate it for the 11 years and 200 price but gosh it's good."
