4.5,"Golden syrup and vanilla with hints of oranges and grapefruit. Plum pudding, Christmas cake, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg and a wisp of Tasmanian peat smoke.

Palate

Sweet vanilla transforms into a heady combination of orange peel, butterscotch, cloves, nutmeg and grapefruit.

Finish

Butterscotch and citrus notes with a long, satisfying smoky finish."
