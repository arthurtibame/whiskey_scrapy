3.0,"My last review on Jameson's ""Deconstructed Series"" is for this ""Lively"" expression, which actually was the worst of the three. ""Round"" was amazing, ""Bold"" was interesting and ""Lively"" is boring. That is a proper description for them. 

Bottled at 40%abv.

Nose: On the bottle smeels like leafs and plants used in cooking. Like a dim mashed basil, maybe. 
There is a meaty aroma like bacon or pork. A little butter. Smells like a kitchen when someone is cooking. Herbs and meat. Herbal. Grainy. Barley. Yeasty. Fresh soapy Ginger spice. After 3 sips aroma gets sweeter. Cinamon bubble gum appear. 

On the palate it is dull. Grainy. Red and yellow apples. Gentle. Maybe a slight saltiness. 

Aftertaste, unlike the other two expressions, is the worst part. Fruity finish, very dim. No spice, no emotion. Fresh, short, boring aftertaste. 

Overall i don't think this is a bad dram, it is just not fun. Its too easy drinkable, too boring. I guess you can drink it like forever but you get this feeling that this is not whiskey, that this cannot get you drunk at all. Its like juice. 62 over 100."

4.0,Lemony and sweet at the same time. Actually quite pleasant for a very reasonable price.  Vanilla stands out more with each sip. Not very complex and a medium finish.
