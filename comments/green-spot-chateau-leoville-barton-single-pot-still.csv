3.5,"A weekend of 4 Irish whiskey samples.

1/4 Green Spot (Leoville Barton)

Nose: light but flavorful ripe yellow apples & pears with a sherry-like aspect. A good bunch of banana too. Then some delicious white chocolate / chocolate butter and honey sweetened cornflakes / puffs. Bright wheat bread. Very smooth with a bid of citrus. No alcohol noticeable. Very likable and nice. 

Palate: pan roasted grains / seeds / nuts. A shy sweetness but the wine sourness and dryness dominate. Only a very mild sharpness. Also a light nutty bitterness with some strong wood tannins. Now the fruity and dry wine aspects shine through ... 

Finish: ... and that is what remains into a medium long finish. Lightly fruity dry and oaky. A very fine and interesting whisky with medium intensity and a characteristic cask style."
4.0,"Nutty, sweet, butterscotch. Mild burn. Very enjoyable if not overly complex."
5.0,"Nose has notes of strawberry and raspberry. The whiskey first notes are darker berry and oak. It retains finishing notes of slightly spicy, like a single pot still whiskey. Very unique whiskey with great flavor!"
5.0,"Cherry, Plum, Cedar"

2.0,"Nose - there's a distinct red wine note here. A lot of candy and fruits. There's roasted elements, burnt char, and while I get some good notes with this there is a youth to this whisky. 

Taste - Vanilla gives way to a very bitter red wine. I get some mint leading, with some fruits and minerals. There are earth notes that are interesting. Then sadly you get that mineral and youthful whisky. 

I think this is pretty average stuff, flawed for sure, but there are nice elements here. 

2 stars and this is weird. There are some 3 star flavors and some 1 star notes."
5.0,Fantastic! The sweetness from the Bordeaux cask does wonders.
4.0,"Honey and orange on the nose.
Vanilla and nuts for stater and a lovely fruity lingering on the tongue"

1.0,I found this to be highly floral. It was clean but the flavor completely turned me off. I enjoy most Canadian whiskey and I really enjoy Jameson. But this whiskey was simply expensive.
4.0,Delicious. Finished in a sherry cask

5.0,"Nose: Upon this nose I smell a wave of aromas, potpourri comes to mind with the mix of floral and herb spices. I also get a sense of baked sugars, a range of berries from raspberry to blueberry I believe. Pinch of maple, mostly honey and bit of lemon zest. 

Palate: Cinnamon is present here along with nice amounts of vanilla thanks to the many oak impressions, there is a lingering sensation of fruits thanks to the wine barrels, a little amount of green apples, of course there is the baking spices. 

Finish: The finish on this whiskey takes its time before departing. It floats about with those rich spices and then like an old friend says farewell."

4.0,"I'm not a huge Irish whiskey fan, but this is definitely good stuff.

The bottle says bordeaux but my nose and palate says mostly bourbon: touch of cherries, toasted oak, some vanilla. The sherry is kinda there, but not by much.

Wonderful stuff!"

4.0,"This Green Spot is initially aged in a mix of Oloroso and bourbon casks (I’ve heard there is new American oak in the mix as well but that’s unconfirmed) and then it’s finished in Bordeaux barrels from Chateau Leoville Barton in Saint-Julien. 

On the nose, I get hot oatmeal with honey, fresh strawberries and raspberries, and baking bread. 

It’s soft and creamy on the palate with flavors of toffee cookies, raspberry jam, and candied pecans. And it has a medium, buttery finish.

I like traditional GS (and it is a perfect whiskey to give to friends who say they don’t like whiskey) but 40% is a little light on the ABV. That’s why I appreciate that they pumped the jam up to 46% on the Chateau Leoville Barton. It’s so much more engaging and complex than the diesel GS."
3.5,OK but not as good as Yellow for the same price.

3.5,"Irish whiskey tasting, The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 7 Feb 2019. Whisky #3

Nose: Dusky floral notes (orange petal and violet potpourri), mixed berry preserves, light honey, buttered brioche. A warm, comforting cereal nose lifted by berry aromas.

Palate: A rich but subtle (slightly restrained?) semi-sweet arrival focused on cereal and nuts (you can taste the un-malted barley component). The development brings out berries, red fruit and vanilla notes. The texture is creamy and slightly oily.

Finish: Medium. A particularly nice finish with a sweet cereal character that gains a mildly drying chocolate bitterness in the aftertaste.

The character of standard Green Spot is transformed by the wine casks into a softer form here, to create what is essentially a variation on a theme.  So, is it worth paying 50% more than the cost of standard Green Spot for this expression? Well, it depends on how much a fan you are of wine-finished whiskey.  If it’s a treatment that you find compelling (and it certainly can be in the right circumstances) then this is a fine example.

I liked this whisky but it was clearly overshadowed by the next 3 whiskies in the tasting flight on the night, two of which were the same price. For me it missed 4 stars by a hair’s breadth as it was just a little too shy and retiring – a tiny bit more prominence to the profile throughout would have pushed it over the line.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"
