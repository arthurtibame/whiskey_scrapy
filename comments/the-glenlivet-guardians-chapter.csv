4.0,"Tasted 10/15/2014 : Sweet, caramel nose right up in your face. Full, sweet, creamy on the palate with vanilla/toffee/caramel sweetness.  A pleasant bite that creeps up.  This finishes along the same sweetness, caramel theme.  An enjoyable, easy dram."

4.0,After reading some reviews this whisky was better than I expected.  A heavier whisky than most Glenlivets and a bit more oily.  The higher ABV definitely does it some favours with some lingering spice and lemon.

5.0,"Probably the sweetest of the Glenlivets with fairly strong hints of sherry, but delicious overall.  Hints of chocolate and is extremely smooth in the mouth."

4.0,"Most sherry cask hints of all the glenlivet offerings. Let this sit in a glass prior to enjoyment - really loves water. 

Palate: dark chocolate and zesty orange spice.

Finish: dry finish. Long"
