2.5,"43, 42 and now 25 year. First 'Darkness' bottling and....not really good.  Finished in 50 litre PX barrels and not sure if it's the turbo charged finish but it seems quite sickly with a weird artificial glueyness. I prefer whiskey to wine these days but the two wine bottles we drank prior to this walked all over this. Cheap at under $80USD but not worth it. Not even going to finish. 2.5"
