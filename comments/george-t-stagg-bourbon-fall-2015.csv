4.0,"Hot hot heat. I actually really liked this years version though not quite as much as 13. Just the hype and price keep me away, and either 01 or 03 bookers 2015 still wins (and is 60$ and no hassle)"

4.0,"Finished the bar bottle at Frank Grisanti's in Memphis 6-17-16.
Big but not HUGE like W Larue W. Nose was brown sugar and almost cedar instead of oak. Light on citrus with surprisingly little red fruit. Taste was full with expected burnt molasses and nutty almond. Hint of tangerine and light baking spice. Long and strong finish with white pepper sprinkled over caramel pie w/chocolate. Drank neat because I was searching for certain familiar flavors that never surfaced? 
Below the 14 on my score and no match for the 14 WLW. I'll do a 88 only because I paid so much! :)"

4.0,"Neat, this whiskey will f*ck your face. Dry oak blankets the show, but plenty of standard bourbon notes are also to be found:  vanilla, caramel, toasted corn, and brown sugar.  This is a superb American whiskey, bumped down to four stars because the price is laughably high."

null,"Paid $399... I know, incredibly high, but a relative value considering other stores are charging over $1k for this in NYC and it's hard to get the 2015 release (I had the 2016 and wasn't a fan)"

5.0,By far one of the best pours I've had the chance of tasting. Just enough heat and still plenty of flavor. Paid 38 for a pour and would do it again.

5.0,"I reallllllly loved this bottle!!!! Had such a nice taste of oak,leather, tobacco and thebage complimented it with subtle flavors drinking immensely under its proof this is a 98/100 for me"

Great stuff!"

4.0,140 proof but feels like low 100s. Not an overly complex palate though. Screams bourbon though. Highly enjoyable.

5.0,"This was my second pour at Chimes and did not disappoint. Despite the high proof, the nose was loaded with vanilla, brown sugar and the perfect amount of oak. I can't say enough about the nose, it is was wonderful. The mouth feel is just about as good as it gets, thick and chewy loaded with heat and pepper.  Great bourbon. Paid $26, asked for a single pour, the sweetheart at the bar gave me a double +!!"

4.0,"Big in the front, even bigger in the middle, tapered towards the end. Good burn.   Vanilla & green apples. Cinnamon too."
5.0,I have never had anything quite like this. The finish was buzzing Carmel apples that lasted for 15 minutes at a time - mind blowing!
4.0,7-17-18. 4.3. Really liked this.  So smooth to start and complex finish that was not overwhelming.  Definitely try anytime can find it.  $20 at Whiskey Road.
