5.0,"For this week's fRyeday review I am featuring the best Rye I have tasted this year! Peerless is a relatively new kid on the block that has been releasing premium priced Rye for a few years now. They have historically been very polarizing for selling very young Rye at a premium price point ($140 for a 2yr when it was released). They now have a few more years under their belt and this is the oldest offering I have had from them. Let me tell you, it's very good! Let's review what's in the bottle:

Mashbill: Undisclosed (at least 51% rye)
Age: 5 yrs
Proof: 110.45 (Cask Strength)
Filtration: Unfiltered
# Bottles: 141 (Single 53 gallon barrel)

Let's dive into the tasting:

Upon entry it's rich and very oily. A certified flavor bomb with notes of toffee, caramel apples and chocolate orange lead. Vanilla and array of nuts with a hint leather on the mid palate. The finish transitions ronan array of baking spices to compliment the sweeter notes and it's just fantastic. Long lingering finish. This rye is a knock out and the first product I have had from Peerless that lives up to it's lofty price tag. As you see picks with this much age on them in your market  jump on them. Cheers all!"
