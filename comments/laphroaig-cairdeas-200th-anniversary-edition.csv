5.0,Lovely nose and lovely color.  Smoke but love the caramel and sweet fruit on the palate.  Drop or two of water does round out.  Wonderful

3.0,"Finally got around to tasting this one...overall a pleasant whisky.  On my palate, it's VERY salty/briney.  I can agree w/Distiller's notes that the brine leads the way.  For me, the smoke/peat wasn't so strong, being almost overwhelmed by the brine, but not quite.  In other words, the peaty, smoky notes are there, and I noticed a little band aid.  It's just not as dominant as their 10 year old or Quarter Cask.  I also got faint oak and just a hint of vanilla.  Thought I got a little citrus at one point, but I'm not sure.  I see Distiller has it at 94 and the avg. rating is 4.3 (at the time I'm writing this).  I'll be in the minority on this one.  I can't get above 85, or three stars.  It's a good whisky, and I would buy it again, but it's not a great whisky."

5.0,"Absolutely love this.  Perfect blend of smoothness, smokiness, and peat.  Neat is just right for me, two three sips puts me in my zone.

So good, I just finished the bottle in a week."

5.0,"I had this last night in NYC at American Whiskey.  A 2oz sampling, with a huge piece of ice in it.  Interestingly, I paid about $70 for a bottle of this, yet the 2oz at American Whiskey was priced at $26 .   
      Either way...this is a really good whisky.  You get a strong maritime aroma, followed by a sweet briny taste like stone fruits combined with salt and smoke.  It's different from other Laphroaigs in the sense that it's gentler and more elegant, but don't take that as milder.  It's like Pierce Brosnan's 007 vs Daniel Craig's.  Elegant vs rough, but both can put you down in a heart beat.   I'm glad I have a bottle at home of this, especially when you consider it's $70.  Update 1/20/2017:  YIPEEEE!!!! It's Friday night, and that means a sojourn with whisky for the weekend!   I'm having this sample generously provided by ModernDrinking (thank you!!!).  I've had this once before, in NYC at American Whiskey...and I loved it then, loving it even more now.   The one thing missing In the 2015 Cairdeas is the smack in your face peat, which I think is a good thing.  The ability to manage peat, salinity, brine, and sweetness is no easy task.  One has to appreciate and respect that amazing balancing act.   This is still available in places...really worthwhile to splurge the $70-80 and get a bottle.  Again---thanks so much to ModernDrinking for the sample!!"

5.0,"Nose is jasmine, vanilla, peach blossom, rose petals. Soft and sweet on the palate, sweet orange peel, vanilla, clover honey, hint of violets."
5.0,"I'm in love. Not as medicinal as the typical 10 year, it maintains its Laphroig roots with strong peaty briny notes, but the change here is a wonderful caramel/Apple note throughout. This is wonderful."

4.75,"What an excellent entry into the Cairdea line--particularly as the standout in an otherwise long chain of secondary casked editions.  This exemplifies all that is essentially Laphroaig and nothing that isn't:  rich notes of green apples, vanilla, seaweed, fish oil, brine, and stone fruits on the nose shift, quite pointedly, to a palate of bacon, sardines, lemongrass, tar, cilantro, pear, and marmalade.  The finish--yet still--has its own unique blend of apricots, campfire, kelp, and a bit of coffee.  It's full bodied and the finish lasts for days--savory and smoky with lingering mouth-coating salt that makes you feel like you are breathing the sea air on the very shores of Islay.  The only thing that's missing are the nutty and oily characters that many Laphroaigs get.  Oh, and the finish isn't just smooth--it has all the burn you want from the peat and none of it that isn't."

5.0,"I've recently been on a tear in the peated Islay scotch world, and just cracked open this bottle.  It compares well to the delicious Ardbeg 10 (with which it shares a lot of similarities), and Kilchoman Machir Bay (which is a bit sweeter and fruitier).  It is surprising to me how much a small additional amount of aging has mellowed out this Laphroaig.  Based on a distillery video featuring John Campbell, this scotch was aged 11 years and 9 months, give or take a little bit of time, so this is about the closest thing you can get to Laphroaig 12 (outside of going to the UK and ordering a bottle of Highgrove, which I intend to do in September!).  The extra time balances out some of the harsher notes of Laphroaig 10, transforming it from James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause to Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke.  It's masculine and substantial, but with the edges of its wild youth rounded off into the confidence that comes in one's prime.  To me, 12-15 years is the sweet spot for the Laphroaig lineup.  The other interesting feature of this scotch is that it's made only from Laphroaig's own floor maltings, and aged in the warehouse closest to the sea, so it's about as pure an expression of the distillery's character as you're likely to find.  At over 50% ABV, this scotch hits the perfect sweet spot, with strong, full flavors in all three phases, but with no unpleasant ethanol characteristics, even in the warm finish.  The nose is classic Laphroaig--peat, a bit of oats or dried cereal grain, a mellow, light smoke, and some seaside air.  The palate has more sweetness, particularly a lemon characteristic, that melds well with the smoke, which takes on a cigarillo characteristic.  The finish is smoky, salty, and again that oat-y or cereal note peaks through.  It's just a lovely scotch."

4.0,"Bourbon nose, peaty, spicy scent with a caramel finish. Pretty sweet to taste, but damn good!"
3.0,"Same as quarter cask but cask strength version. 

Nose: strong ethanol and similar underlying as quarter cask. Peaty and some sweet. 

Palate: again, similar with more of a burn. Sweet and peaty. Ashy finish on the throat. It is my 4th tasting. 

Couple drops of water sweetens it and cuts the burn on nose and palate. 

I like it and would buy. Maybe prefer the quarter cask though. 3 star"

2.0,"Nose- Heavy peat with floral and lemon notes
Body- It’s bright with little peppery (almost electric) bites on my tongue. There is definitely heat here. The peat smoke gives way to a hickory smoke. 
Finish- The peat phenols give way to lemon and grass."

5.0,"Alright alright alright! Neat! The nose is bacon up front for me.. peat smoke, and oaky wood, leather, and thankfully the citrus is distant.. caramel apples!!  Let's go down the rabbit hole for the palate... Nice and smooth - no water needed (but this my third dram shhh!) .. Great campfire flavor with that Laphroaig brine we know and love. Dark deep apple with subtle pie crust on the backend. The finish is long and nice with ash, baked crust, cinnamon, and more bacon... This is like an intense Lagavulin 16, if it was cask strength.. wow... This one needs a re-release...STAT!"

5.0,This is Soooooo Good. To me it is like drinking Red Velvet Cake that has been smoked! I wish it was made EVERY YEAR!
4.25,"Drammers Club online pour. Solid stuff, draws line to where one can get more affordable than the 18+ year tropical fruits but also get something where smoke is not the only thing you get unlike the standard 10 year.

5.0,Surprised to say this tastes like cherry jam laid on bacon and smoke! Peat and alcohol don’t overpower though. Massive coffee on the finish. Quite simply one of the best scotch whisky’s I’ve ever had the pleasure of tasting. The nose is off the charts. A gem.

4.25,"Tasting date: 10/18/19

ABV: 51.5%

Color: gold

Nose:  peat, light smoke, salty with some sea air, caramel apple

Palate: peaty, smoky, a little hot but didn’t overwhelm like some cask strength.  

Finish:  long and warm, peaty and smoky

Impression:  classic laphroaig character with some additional sweetness.  Nicely balanced at the cask strength.  A little more floral with water but better neat."
