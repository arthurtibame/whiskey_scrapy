3.5,Need to try it when I’m sober lol decent
5.0,Fruit (apple?) and cinnamon sweet nose. Cinnamon sugar flavor. Warm and smooth cinnamon finish.
4.5,"Color: 
Medium amber with a touch of brilliant shine. Fairly quick to fall, but long lingering legs. 

Nose:
Strong vanilla up front with a subtle undertone…maybe butterscotch? Nearer notes of light oak and spices 

Palate:
The barley and corn dance around with some baking spices and apple with just a hint of vanilla. It all wraps up with a touch of smoky charred oak

Adding a touch of water blends the grains into something reminiscent of a single malt, highlighting the smooth vanillin rich oakiness"

3.0,Nose of wet dog and urine. Which I think is just me. Others loved the smell. But strangely I still enjoyed it.

null,"Regardless of the score and lack of refinement - once this bottle is opened, it quickly disappears.  I attribute it to its easy on the pallette drinkability and smooth fruit finish.  At any party with bourbon drinkers, they quickly turn from the makers mark and woodford reserve to downing a few pours of this little goodie. Do not undersatnd distiller tasting note - of cinnamon red hot...if there is a Colorado whiskey to avoid it's Stranahans."

5.0,"I found this to be smooth, not hot at all. Given the small size of this craft distiller and single barrel nature of each bottle, perhaps some variation is to be expected. In any case, I loved it. By the way, they make a great pear brandy, too."
