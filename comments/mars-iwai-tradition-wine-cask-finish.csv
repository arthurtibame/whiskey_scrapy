3.0,"Red wine flavors, caramel, slightly dry. Okay"
4.0,"3.75. Nice caramel color. Brown sugar on the nose. Appreciated the depth of flavor, definitely tasted the wine cask- made it feel somewhat tannic, medium linger and nice alcoholic burn, finished leaving my mouth feel very dry, and left a taste like I licked hot sauna wood"

5.0,This is one of my favorite Japanese whiskies and is by far the best bang for the buck at under ¥3000 (around $28) here in Japan. It honestly competes with my Macallan Rare Cask which is like 10x more expensive.  Its more complex and balanced than the Macallan but has a lighter and less rich mouth feel and shorter finish. Notes wise Distillers review in spot on for the most part.
