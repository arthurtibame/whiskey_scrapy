3.5,"nice nose (classic caramel, oaky notes), decent taste with some leather; peppery but not overwhelming | liked the longish finish
expensive, however (over $40) - probably better options in that price range"
2.25,It’s just ok. Not much nose and has a little more spice than I would like to finish.

3.75,Sweet. Spicy. Nothing crazy. Solid drink.
2.0,"I tried this bourbon on about 3 separate occasions, tried to like it but just ended up being a mixer to me. 

Bourbon is not necessary just bad, its just very bland and ok. The bottle is basic, the label (in my opinion) looks cheap and ugly, the price point is 30 - 40$ range. This one drinks more like a sub 20$ bottle. Used as a mixer and got this one out of my collection. If it was cheaper, I would bump up my rating."
2.25,Tried neat. Light and vanilla sweet nose. Sweet at the beginning and has a peppery finish. Going to revisit this one again neat and on the rocks. Found for 33$ but feel this is more of a 20$ bottle from my first taste. Brought down the value of this for me and the rating

0.25,This is really bad. Does not improve with water. Will ruin a perfectly good coke if you try to mix with it.

3.5,This used to be one of my favorite bourbons but it’s not as good now. Peppery at the back and caramel in the early part. Still good but not my favorite.

2.0,"carmelly delicious.
good"
1.0,"This is bad. I can only assume these were the barrels that were so bad the master distiller didn’t reasonably believe he could blend out the flavor to make something better. Until it’s empty, this exists only to impart whiskey flavor to my coke."
2.25,"The nose is very bland, a little hint of vanilla and tannin.  Hint of vanilla gives way to an overwhelming taste of toffee and peanut butter.  Not much mouthfeel at all.  I'm just not really a fan."
0.5,"I only gave this a. 5 because it is liquid and it is in a bottle. I hated this stuff. Nose is super thin rye spice with alcohol. Taste is hot alcohol. Teaspoon of water didn't help. No sweetness. Some say buttered popcorn. I get that, but it's too much work to taste that for me. Tastes like Old Granddad. I literally poured half of this bottle down the drain. Just not for me. Others, especially old granddad fans may like. It was similar for me to old forester 100 proof. Bleh."
3.75,From Dad’s - Bill Roirdon gave it.

3.0,"Fruity and floral nose. Definitely getting some fruit in the taste. Good, but not great."
4.0,Initially unremarkable but once a few sips coat the inside of your mouth it opens up a bit. Vaguely reminds of a cheaper Weller. It was a gift so no idea of the cost.

4.0,"Not really sure where this bottle came from, a good friend must have thought I would like it and brought it as a gift to me. Well you may be my best friend, who ever you are. This is a semisweet with citrus, mild yet spicy vanilla. Don't know the costs, cause I didn't buy it but assume it's under $35. Check out your cabinet and see if your neighbor left you a bottle. It's gets four stars cause I don't know the cost and I didn't pay for it."
