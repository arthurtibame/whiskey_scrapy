5.0,"Big noticeable influence of the sherry, similar in flavor profile to Balvenie 15 (of which this juice is rumored to be sourced) in my opinion, but this seems more robust even, possibly due to the freshness of the Sherry. Off the bat you get light smoke and oakiness, then leather/tobacco leaf. Throughout there’s a background of sherry with a long finish that you can sit and ponder on"
