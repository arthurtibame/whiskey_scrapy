3.0,"On the nose, classic old man bourbon, with brown sugar and leather. Smooth on the palate, with spice that kicks in late. Good mouthfeel, creamy even, but light flavors. The leather is still there. Slight bitterness lingers. 5/20/18"
4.25,Magnum’s barrel selection. 114 proof. 14 years in the barrel. Just enough heat to make it interesting but not overwhelming. Sweet with a “Fruit Stripes Gum” vibe on the backend. 4.2.
3.75,"Nose- Raw peanut,grass and a hint of mint.
Body- Raw peanut notes with dark chocolate and brown sugar. Sweet overall.
Finish- Mocha and a hint of cinnamon. 

Pretty good."

4.0,"Reviewing Batch 13. Aged 5.5 years @ 113 proof. Kentucky and Tennessee juice blend.
Barrell Bourbon is one of my favorite Bourbon's! Each batch is a pleasure, and batch 13 is right along the same lines as the rest.
Now while each batch has a different flavor profile (as is the blender's intent) they have all been very tasty. 
I opened this bottle over Christmas last year, but just 
noticed I had yet to review it. I just sampled another pour and on to the review:
Upon entry you are hit with a big cigar tobacco note with spice and anise. This then rolls into a rye and clove swell with some noticable heat. The finish is long featuring some black pepper and oak notes that linger and are a little drying. 
If you are a fan of Rye or High Rye Bourbon, this one is a home run for you. It's wonderful 
It's complexity defies it's age. This truly illustrates the impact of a master blender at work. 
Strong recommendation. I still see a bottle about here and there. If you see one and like a spicy profile, go ahead and pull the trigger. If you prefer sweet than go for Batch 14!"

3.75,"Nose: earthy (the malted barley) for a bourbon but not a bad thing. Subtle popcorn notes. Some oak in there. 

Palate: moderately rich, yet on the lighter side in the mouthfeel (low oil) spicier than the nose. Citrus and rye. 

Finish: medium, more rye and slight cola"

4.25,"Exellent nose- vanilla, brown sugar. Cinnamon and spice initially on palette followed by smooth flavorful finish."
3.5,"Nose: ethanol is louder than I expected for an expensive blended bourbon. Some corn, slight oak, earthy

Palate: soapy, briny, bitter but muted traditional bourbon notes 

Finish: best of the three, some sweetness and less bitter at the end 

Somehow this bottle got worse over time. Definitely not the best batch of Barrell Bourbon."
3.75,"Nose: candied nuts, peppercorn, oak

Palate: rich, baking spices, hints of gingerbread and candy apple

Finish: medium warmth but not too hot, very balanced 

Lovers of Elmer T Lee, Very Old Barton, Russell’s Reserve or Old Grandad might enjoy this a lot. A few drops of water smooths over the hotter rye bits but leaves a lot of the rest intact."
