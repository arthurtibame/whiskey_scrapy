4.0,"Smells young, but pleasant with hints of raspberry, honeysuckle, pomegranate and melon

At the low proof of 87.2, the young age is evident but not unpleasant.  Smooth with a soft mouthfeel that reminds me of chrysanthemum tea, sea foam, white grape juice, mead and a light rye spice. It finishes young. It certainly is not worth the asking price, but, at the end of the day, it was a gift and I appreciate the atypical flavor profile."
