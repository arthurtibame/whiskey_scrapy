null,"Fantastic, warm and wintery"
4.0,"An invitingingly fresh and lively sweet nose of honey, vanilla, brown sugar, fruit with hint of salt and a faint whisp of smoke.  The palate receives a creamy, medium-body.  The initial caramel sweetness is the first to arrive.  As the sweetness dissipates, oakyness with some smoke and bitterness arrive and quickly fades and that initial sweetness makes one more brief appearance.  The palate is left with some with a pleasantly long finish of black pepper, oak and a walnut/fresh nuts.  A splash of water amplifies the sweetness and smoke, smoothes the edges on the palate and lessens the pepper on the finish.  This is one that becomes a better dram with a small amount of water, but not too much, and time.  Overall, a lovely, fun, easy dram.  A great Speyside representation. Perfect for those warm spring days when there is a bounce in your step.  Easy to drink, great to share.  [88/100]. [Opened: 2/21/15 on a beautiful, warm winter evening; Revisited: 1/9/16]"

3.0,"Benromach 10, a 10 year old single malt scotch whiskey hailing from the speyside region. Price $60.00 Sampled 12/2/15 with 3/4 teaspoon of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.

Aroma - Light grapefruit, plantain banana, lime leaves, slight brine, brown sugar, lemon zest, rye bread and some green apple.

Taste - Gentle smoke, light cookie dough, Buttery, some green apple. Reminds me a bit of a light version of Highland Park 12 year.

Finishes with a medium lingering flavor and long lasting burn.

Final score : 3 / 5, this was just okay, I might consider buying again at the right price."

4.0,"Nose: Rich nutty sherry, madeira-like caramel, leather, savory/umami smoke, walnuts, a thin seam of spearmint and an underlying note of overripe banana (Reminds me so much of my very first bottle of Highland Park 12, sadly consecutive bottlings have been less impressive). Palate: The thickest, most syrupy mouthfeel I've enjoyed yet. Sweet malty grain and citrus spice. Finish: Starts strong with a touch of hot menthol, light smoke, slightly bitter oak, ending with a soft, lingering bourbon-like hot cinnamon! So unusual for a speysider, a must-try. The  quality of casks is easily recognizable. Can't wait to track down a fifth of the 15 year. Dry glass: a stiff whiff of ""peat-reek""..."

4.25,"It takes more than a few drams to decipher the great complexity of this lightly peated Speysider. The nose has numerous layers. Predominant features are delicate bonfire smoke, polished wood and caramel sweetness with apricots, green apples and raisins. Flavorwise, Benromach 10 arrives strong and spicy, turning slightly dry and mineral with a blanket of leafy smokiness. Well-balanced oak cask influence contributes to a nutty, savory and prolonged finish, leaving behind mild bitterness and peat smoke. It's a highly recommended, sophisticated whisky.

This russet-colored treat introduces itself via a nose of trail mix, the kind that includes guava and pineapple among the nuts. It's viscous on the tongue, then slightly sweet, with an artful mix of gentle smoke and citrus notes - marmalade and lime jelly. The finish returns to the nutty theme, this time raw peanuts in their skins. An all-round delicious daily drinker."

5.0,"Guys, I think I found it. That go-to bottle. That one whisky that you love every little thing about, from the bold and stylish presentation to the complex taste. This makes you remember why you consider yourself a scotch drinker in the first place. Now I know you're curious, ""What does it taste like?"" The thing is, I get something different with every sip. I can't wait to explore this bottle. After the first dram, I get mint, delicate smoke, banana, and sherry-derived nuts on the nose. The palate is quite sweet, reminiscent of raisins and pineapple. A tiny red pepper is lying dormant in there too. Sherry nuts meet smoke on the finish. Pairs well musically with Iron Sky from Paolo Nutini. Great stuff, a worthy whisky for my 50th note on Distiller. Cheers!"

4.0,"Nose: Earth, leather, malt, caramel and peat smoke lead the way but as you get past those aromas it becomes apparent that this is at heart a winey nose with a very well handled sherry influence. There's a fruity hint and some waxed pine wood furniture in the background, and if you smell deeply there's a little ethanol hit with citrus and grassy notes in attendance.

Palate: Sweet woody and malty arrival that develops into a rich fruity palate. Somewhere along the way a delightful smokiness suddenly blossoms in the mouth, accompanied by a warm, buzzy glow of spices - ginger and sweet paprika - and mixed herbs. There's an oily and even faintly briny citrus note, but it's not a maritime profile - just a couple of flakes of salt with a drop of lemon juice. A very nice texture.

Finish: Long, salty, smoky and meaty, like a sugar-maple smoked ham. The lingering aftertaste is citrus/herbal and delicately smoky.

A subtle and well balanced whisky that recalls the stronger aromas and more potent smokiness of the 15 year old but does not attempt to mimic them - you can just easily see the same DNA in evidence.

The nose is excellent and keeps unfolding right through the tasting. A few drops of water enhances the woody notes throughout and unveils a little sweetness. [The dry glass aroma is astonishingly reminiscent of esturine mud-flats at low-tide].

Amanda Schuster's note that ""This is one of those whiskies that stimulates the palate and actually makes one hungry for food"" is right on the mark. This is a wonderful aperitif.

Beautiful, complex but well-balanced whisky at a very reasonable price.  For those who prefer a more forceful dram, there is the 100 proof 10 year old that is essentially the same whisky as this but turned up to 11. This potent forcefulness carried more intensity of flavour, but in my opinion a little less nuance. Both are 4 star whiskies.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

I can probably get this cheaper, but even at $65, I am happy to buy again.

I was blown away by this bottle, and it immediately reminded me of the complexity and quality offered by Springbank at 10 years old.  Unfortunately, I did not have an open Springbank 10 for comparison.  This bottle was close to the previous #10 whisky: Talisker Distiller’s Edition.  There’s a nice play on sherry and peat.  Spirit forward with loads of fruitiness, transitioning to spiciness.  A moderate peat.  Nice ginger and old rope on the finish.  Again, this is very close to the Talisker DE.  In a large line-up, I preferred the Talisker, but head-to-head, this was the winner.  The foundation is just more solid.

4.75,"To be upfront, I am admittedly a huge Benromach fan.  I am a huge fan of that old-world style.  They are akin to a Springbank in Speyside clothing, if you will.

Nose:  Right off the bat you get the sherry influence but it's equally very earthy with a touch of smoke mixed in.  Saltiness, dusty tobacco, wood polish, cherries, green apples, golden raisins, chocolate-orange, apple cobbler, salt water taffee, nuttiness reminiscent of walnuts maybe...There's a lot to explore here.

Taste:  More sweet earthiness.  Very malty and rounded.  Figs, chocolate, wood polish, heather, salty, leathery, portabella mushrooms, tea, golden raisins, a bit waxy, slightly meaty,  a touch of vanilla.

Finish:  Medium in length and dry...light billows of smoke, salt & pepper, wood polish, lots of leather, bitter wood, charred bbq ends.

The folks over at G&M really know what they are doing and it shows with their standard 10yr offering.  It's approachable enough for the novice due to it's impeccable balance yet complex enough for the more discerning connoisseur.  In my opinion, it's the most complex 10yr available slightly ahead of the mighty Springbank 10yr which is more spirit-driven.  My only knock on it is that it is released at 43% abv rather than my desired 46%.  I'd also venture to say that it's the best value on the market today.  A wonderfully put together whisky that will always be a staple in my cabinet."

3.75,"Flowery, heather sweetness on the nose that segues into a light smoky, almost meaty character.  Palate is vanilla and golden raisins, interspersed with smoke.  And while it can gravitate towards a ham-like note, it doesn't quite get there.  Is there salinity? I can't say. But if so - together with the wood spice - it can almost be considered savory.  This is a very competent and impressive expression of sweet and peat (and don't forget about the malt).  The Benromach 10 borders Highland Park 12 in quality and price.  If you can get this at a discount, pick up a bottle.  You won't regret it.

4.5,Perfectly balanced peated malt. For me it's by far better than over-smocked Laphroiag or Lagavulin. Very pleasant: reminded me Ardbeg  Corryvreckan - just a little less sweet and the same way complex. Now I am seriously interested to taste their 15YO

3.25,"Nose - Ultra lightly peated sweet funk, black pepper, honey, smoky fruity medicinal sweet

Taste - Sweet light smoke, black pepper, funky goji berry sweet, baked apples

Finish - Lingering light salty smoke, funky fruity sweet, light lingering warmth

Score - 76/100

Final Thoughts - So upon first nosing this, it reminded me of Highland Park 12 with less smoke. This one has a very very gentle smoke component and just a hint of salt with this sweet funky fruit that reminds me quite a bit of HP12. It's not bad by any means as the smoke is very subtle but for me the sweet funky fruit throws me off a bit. Maybe others will like this, but it's just not for me. It's pretty well balanced but for a person who isn't a huge fan of peat, this goes in the ""not really for me"" category.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.25,"The Nose: first dark cherry, then cherry cough syrup think robitusson,mile peat smoke which comes across as overly roasted nuts

The Pallete: Dark fruits as in cherry and plum, overly smoked/ roasted nuts,

The Finish: short somewhat dry, fruity medicinal note, with a gingery bit of saltiness

Overall it lacks some complexity and its alittle rough around the edges but it is still very easy sipper. This would be a great gateway scotch into islay."

4.0,well balanced Speyside malt.  nothing too fancy here.
4.5,"Appearance: This single malt had a light copper color with very thin very oily legs.

Nose: On my first approach, the nose held a very fruity aroma. On the following whiffs, however, the peaty smoke joined in the mix. Notes consisted of pear, strawberry, apple, cashews, vanilla, and salty peat that more so translated in my mind as walking through the damp forest. It was quite lovely!

Taste: On the palate I perceived notes of ripe banana (but not too much), earthy peat, cherry, plum, sour green grape, a maltiness, and a dryness that was left after the swallow that continued through the finish.

Finish: The finish was medium-long in length and pretty clingy. It also possessed a honeyed and I want to say, mossy, aftertaste. 

Thoughts: This was a treat for me! I’ve found I greatly enjoy peated whiskies; so when this Speyside scotch came my way I was excited to try it, but after a few sniffs and a closer label inspection, I realized this was one of the best Speysides I’ve had yet! If you like peat and the fruity non-peated Speysides haven’t been your thing, this is a stellar compromise! I definitely wouldn’t mind buying this again! Thank you Benromach! Sláinte!"

4.5,"Very Good!! I opened this bottle nearly two years ago, enjoyed a couple of drams with friends, put it in the cabinet and somehow forgot about it. Sometimes that happens to an old geezer like me. I rediscovered it today and was so happy to see it. It is as glorious as I remember it to be. Pours a dark amber in the glass and exhibits decent legs. Noses of malt, peat, and dark honey---think buckwheat honey. It has a great mouthfeel, the peat is burning fall leaves, and the honeyed malt lingers in the long finish. There is also a slight salinity in the finish. The flavors are strong and pure--if the bottle was not labeled Speyside, I could be convinced this was a Highland. The peat level is not as heavy as a typical Islay, I would say it is similar to Highland Park 12."

4.0,"Had at bluefin bay 2019  thanksgiving dinner. It nosed sweet and malty. Initial taste was a little peppery and alcohol forward. But with one ice cube it was very fruity, malty, sweet with vanilla and toffe and a small amount of smoke. Body and finish are medium and really delicious. Maybe not as much stewed fruit as the 15 but really tasty"
