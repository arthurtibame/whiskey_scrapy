3.5,"Not great, not terrible. Pretty middle of the road bourbon, may not be worth the price"
0.5,"Very young on the nose, somewhat unpleasant. Taste isn't bad but definitely needs more time in the barrel."
3.75,"Caramel nose that is almost syrupy. Same on the taste along with oak. A little spice, maybe cinnamon. Strong alcohol harshness for 90 proof.
Oily mouthfeel, but somehow also dry oaky finish. Lingers with a little mint. Like you recently finished off a peppermint candy.
Biggest knock is the harshness, but good level and mix of flavors. Bottle was bought in 2014."
3.5,"I really enjoyed this with my dinner the other evening. It had some strong oak vibes, which is typical of Florida whiskey (thank you, heat), but it wasn't overpowering to an other array of flavors that changed throughout the meal.

Nose: Oak, strong vanilla and candied caramel (reminded me a ton of Caramel Creams from my childhood), and some chocolate.

Taste: It keeps changing as it opens up. Initially the wood and dust were prevalent, but it evolved into something that gave nearly a dozen different tastes. Chocolate malt, cinnamon, cherry, coffee, orange, lemon are among the tastes that showed up.

Finish: There's a buttery easiness to the way this ends. It doesn't hit you, but rather transitions away gracefully. The flavor sticks with you, which I like, but at not point is it challenging. 

Value: It was a unique experience, and I'm partial being front Central Florida...but I can say that $14 per pour is probably too much given that some other good offerings were available at less than $10. Still, I'm happy I tried it and would happily have it in my collection at home.

Overall: 87. It's good, different and complex. Feels like it's somewhere midway between a bourbon and a scotch. This is quality stuff, but not for everyone. And I was expecting the woodiness having had other Florida whiskey before. With that being said, this is absolutely worth a try if you want a great expression of a Florida distiller."
