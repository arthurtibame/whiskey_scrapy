3.0,"$69.99 @ Total Wine. Reviewing 5/18/18 release. 
 Smooth, maltiness upon entry, spicy mid palatte and sweet long finish. Still out of balance and disjointed. 6/10."

4.0,"Soft nose. pleasant, but muted. But then it opens up. On the palate, the there's sweetness. But nothing else stands out and I mean that in the best way. This is complex and balanced. Some lingering spice. Hard to put a finger on it, and in that way, mission accomplished. Tell me a particular whisk(e)y is in it and I'll believe you. Savor this. 5/10/18

Batch 2, March 2018. Nose is similar, with malty notes but soft. Sweet notes as well, a strong honey note. On the palate, surprisingly sweet up front, cola notes initially. Some baking spice. Smooth and drinkable for the proof, with a nice spicy sting at the end. Another winner. 6/2/18

Batch 4, May 2018. More sandalwood notes. Herbs. Sweet and strange, but in a good way. Ends with a floral note. Changes with each sip. Another winner. 7/3/18

Batch 3, April 2018. Seems in line with the other batches, with an emphasis on the clove honey notes. Herbs, sandalwood as well. 8/17/18"

3.75,"This is the March Batch, which some folks seem to be laying here. So here we go...Alcohol forward (and all the damn way through), this one opens WAY up with a touch of water. A totally woody on the first wash (who doesn’t love a nice woody?!) with a layer of cognac and pepper following. A bit of a dry but lingering finish that sits on a welcome bed of brown sugar, wood chips, and all that sweet, sweet burn these folks are known for. This one is bottle 786. Cheers!"

4.0,"First taste was intense and “interesting”. You can tell it’s cask strength but not in the typical burning way... it got more intense the longer it lingered. Odd flavor... not bad... just odd??

Added a few drops of water and vanilla and sweetness came out. There is something else there I can’t put my finger on. I’m sure I’ll think of it once I read others comments. The spice has moved towards a cinnamon/pepper feel.

Added and few more drops and the pepper spice is really kicking now. More wood and less sweetness. The pepper... wowza. It’s like I ate spicy food... in a good way???

The nose at this point is damp wood.

Def liked it best with just a few drops. It was fun experience though. 

Ps. If it matters, this was a 5/29/18 bottling..."

3.25,Taste more like scotch. Smooth but a little peaty.
2.0,Party with spice. Flavor jumps around and not in a good way
3.0,Scotch overpowered other notes

3.5,"Not sure how to review this. The first pour I had of this, I loved. The next day, I came back for a pour and I was concerned but still pleased. The same day I had a third pour, and now I hated it.

I'm sure it had to do with the other things I was drinking at the same time. I often find that drinking different whiskeys back to back cause certain flavors to become more pronounce in a whiskey that might not normally emphasize such flavors.

I remember distinctly liking this the first time I had it and thinking it was complex and somewhat scotch-like with notes of caramel.  By the most recent time I had this, all I could taste was what I believe other people refer to as the dickel Flintstone vitamin flavor. There is definitely an artificial fruit vitamin flavor going on that was the only thing I could taste."
