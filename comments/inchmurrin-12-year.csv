3.0,"As curious a whisky as I have ever come across. It's unusual in so many ways, but not unpleasant. And for something at 46% ABV, surprisingly flat and short of the finish. Still... smooth. There's some exotic raisin, some honey, some carnation, maybe even clementines and freshly brewed coffee. Honestly, it's the combination that is so unusual and fascinating. I could even see myself liking this with enough exposure. Cheers!"

3.0,"Really more like a 3.5 here. This was had toward the end of the EPIC Loch Lomond/Glen Scotia tasting I attended, so feel free to take my impressions with a grain of salt, but...there's just something about the Loch Lomond malts that makes them a bit funky on the nose. It came out here, too, along with more pleasant vanilla and caramel notes. The palate isn't funky in the least, but instead becomes a very warm, spicy, expressive dram oozing with vanilla, caramel, and stone fruit. It was tasty; if it weren't the slightly off-putting nose and the price being a bit too high for me, I'd give it 4 stars."

4.0,"I’ve never had anything like this. I’m not sure if that taste is peat, or bandaids, or pine or what, but it’s interesting and I’d try it again. Not overly sweet or fruity, but dominated by this mystery taste."
3.0,Great first taste but the after taste is a bit unpleasant

3.0,"Floral, slightly herbaceous, but otherwise muted nose. The palate is an unusual but tasty combination of clove, apples, honey and grapefruit rind. Finish is terribly flimsy, but overall, this whisky scores a few points for originality."

4.0,"Spicy nose. Smooth body with lots of spice and caramel. Finish is mid long with a lot of spice and a peaty undertone at the end. Like it a lot. 

Even better with a drop or two of water. Mellows it out but none the spiciness goes away"

3.25,"Colour is well brewed black tea but with no frills and with some pale orange/red shade.
The nose is sharp but not spiritous at all, it’s heavily spiced with many fruity and flowery notes. Might be described as a sour fresh berry tyrolean pie. Traditionally some vanilla, butterscotch and even banana. This will sound absolutely nonsense but I definitely feel the vibe of some threadbare dusty commode.
The taste is boisterous in spice again, some varnish (like in Auchentoshan), wood, tobacco, lemongrass dominating on a palate, also some fruity/vanilla and butterscotch sweet. And something like a “iodine brown sugar syrup”.
Finish is watery sweet with some dry and bitter notes, some citrus zest; lasts fairly long.
In overall it might be described as a more spiced typical middle-aged highlander. Or as an unpeated version of Inchmoan 12 what is probably an absolute true."

Palate: citrus, pine, oak, slight caramel, grapefruit

4.0,"I'm sipping a 12 year old single cask, cask strength limited edition and enjoying it.

My immediate thoughts went to the Japanese products I enjoyed before they became unattainable for ordinary humans. This shares the forest, fresh air quality (grassy does it no justice). A subtle drop but the higher abv gives real punch without losing a coherent flavour profile. A drop of water releases the full taste range.

On the nose, forest air. Love it. In the mouth apple, custard and a welcome citrus edge to heighten the experience. The finish is not huge but leaves the palate tingly.

Different. Perhaps not for everyone. But I give it a more please rating."

3.0,"Nose: Bit of a strong start, 'cuts' your nose a bit. Get some apple scent.

Flavour: Definitely comes with a bit of a alcohol bite. Not getting too much other flavours due to that.

Finish: Actually hangs in there for quite some time, in quite an pleasant way."
3.25,"Strong alcoholic bite, citrus, fruit, chocolatey hints."
