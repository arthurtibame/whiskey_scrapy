3.5,"Quick Hit review. Lighter and delicate, well balanced and doesn't need much water to bring out the flavor. Definitely heavily reused refill cask as you have to strain harder than a constipated mule to get a lot of favour initially. Light Gingerbread type profile. Short oddish finish. All round not to bad though."
