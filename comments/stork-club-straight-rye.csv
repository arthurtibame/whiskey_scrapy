3.5,A German Rye from a German distillery using German Grains finished in ex white wine casks. Interesting! The combination is a typical rye profile which is more rich and earthy blended with dry wine flavours e.g. green pepper. I wouldn't say I'm a big fan but it definitely has style and uniqueness and the flavours blend well.
5.0,"Nose is rather subtle, but it shines going in and down. Everything I'm looking for in a rye."
