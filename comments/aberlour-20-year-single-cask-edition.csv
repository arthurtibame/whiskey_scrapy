5.0,"I bought this at the distillery in October, 2018.  Nose is absolutely stunning.  Vanilla bean, pastry shop, chocolate, caramel and dark fruit.  On the palate, this incredible whiskey is actually quite dry, but still juicy in dark fruit.  The finish seems to last forever.  I really can’t say enough about it."
