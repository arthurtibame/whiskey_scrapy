3.0,"It hits with a strong alcohol punch and then the cream and fruit notes kick in. One wouldn't search this out, however it could be a very solid go to everyday bourbon."

3.0,"Light, sipping is average, comes through with a fruity note, but it is accented at the end and not carried through the whole tasting..sip with ice, don’t expect robust..expect solid fruity ending, and light all the way through."

3.25,I taste herbs and spice and everything nice. A pretty smooth Rye whiskey. The bite is much less than I expected for 100 proof.

1.5,Smells like a band aid. And fiery.
4.0,Tasting is very complex as the expert says starts with an alcohol burn on the way in but develops into a collection of spices goes down nice and easy with little alcohol burn aftertaste is a burn reminiscent of radishes and what ever the taste of oragel is (in a good way)

3.0,"Thin and spicy, a little oily. Lighter spices, clove or baking spices. Tastes maybe a little herbal or floral. There's a unique note in there I can't place."
