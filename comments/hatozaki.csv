3.0,"Nose is tequila smell. Taste is unique. Kind of bandaid aftertaste like a smoked scotch , without the smoke"

2.0,"Color: Pale champagne silk (Pinot Grigio), white wine, extra light olive oil 

Nose: Botanical/herbal (gin-like). Light Heather honey. Grainy young smelling. Reminds me of barrel aged gin. Nose doesn't scream 100% malted barley like they state on the box and back of the bottle... Screams grain blend. Disappointing. 

Palate: Far superior to the nose. Heather honey, vanilla, young slight alcohol burn; hint of milk chocolate. Slight drying (think dark cocoa and the white of an orange peel). Whips of smoke (peat?). Salted caramel and brine. Ever so slight Macadamia nut. Water ruins the experience and makes it flat. Only taste sweet honey and slight smoke after the water. 

Finish: Very short and drying with cocoa dryness developing. 

Overall: 70/100 or 2 stars 

Would you order it: No 
Would you drink it if offered: If there was no other whisky available, yes otherwise no. 
Would you recommend it: No 

Better stuff at the $69 price point. Everyone's trying to ride the Yamazaki and Hibiki success wave for profit."

3.25,Quite smooth. Tastes almost as a half waypoint between scotch and bourbon
2.5,Very strong upfront with smell. For how light the color is it has a lot of favors. Oaky and peat smells and flavor
