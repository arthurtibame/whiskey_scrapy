4.0,"Whiskey #3 from my trip to Delilah's.  

Delilaht's has a lot of bespoke whiskeys, but one that stood out for me was a Kilchoman bottle made for Delilah's and Jack Rose in DC, and aptly titled the Kilchoman Delilah's and Jack Rose First Cask.  It is aged for five years in Sauternes Casks and bottled at 59.6% ABV.  

On the nose, there is smoke, salt, berries and perhaps a bread note.  The palate brings a familiar Kilchoman peat smoke that tastes of ash at a level that is far more than a wisp but less than billowing.  There are more berries, perhaps a bit more tart than the nose, and a hint of vanilla cream and oak.  

This may be the first Sauternes cask finished whisky I've tried, and it compliments the Kilchoman peat very well without taking the spotlight (which I find can happen with Kilchoman's sherry cask finished whiskies like the Sanaig and Machir Bay).  It's less aggressive than the Loch Gorm, and quite smooth for being just under 60% ABV.

Normally, I wouldn't request the addition of a bespoke bottle, but since it's unique, reasonably distinct from other Kilchomans I've tried, and available at two of the best whiskey bars in the US, it seemed worthy of sharing.  It doesn't break new ground for Kilchoman, but it's definitely worth a try if you're a Kilchoman fan and find yourself in Chicago or DC."
