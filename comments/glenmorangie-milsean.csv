4.0,"Attended a tasting event last night at our local pub presented by Dan Crowell (US Central Ambassador Glenmorangie/ Ardbeg) of which I got the opportunity to taste this. The nose was floral with a pastry scent that would come and go. The palette was sweet up front, followed by hard candies with oakiness presenting itself in the back. The finish had almost but not quite a mint remembrance and a continuation of hard candies."

3.0,"I'm a fan of Glenmorangie, especially their Signet and some of these special bottlings.   This one comes in a nice box too, reminiscent of  an ice cream parlor.  Too bad it doesn't taste like ice cream though.  The nose is sweet floral.  I really like this aroma.  Marshmallows, jelly beans, and coconut.  Really good dessert dram.  I'm struggling with the palette though.  I find it too bourbon-y.  Candy corn, vanilla, and oak.  It's like having Knob Creek.  I'm just not sure I like this.  I'm really not a bourbon guy, and this is too much like bourbon.  I don't understand why they would want to replicate a bourbon but dress it up like a Scotch?  The price point doesn't make sense for that either.  I can get a Knob Creek for a fraction of the price.  I like the experimentation...just not sure if it makes sense in this case.  UPDATE 2/26:  Had another dram of this from a freshly opened bottle.  My original assessment still stands...I think it's a good experiment, but just not sure why a scotch is trying to be a bourbon.  ( Ryan---you'll like this in the SDT sample)"

3.0,"Nose - Sweet candied apples, honey toasted granola, candied ginger and orange peels, creme brulee crisp topping.
Taste - Sweet candied apple shell, rock candy ginger and orange peels, toasted and sugared peaches/nectarines, faint apple peel/seed bitterness at the end.
Finish - Lingering peach/nectarine sweetness mixes and lingers with the apple seed/skin bitterness. Candied ginger spiciness lingers followed with a tiny bit of bitter oak.
Score - 76/100
Final Thoughts - This definitely had a nice nose, nice toasted sugar notes as if you could smell someone making creme brulee or a toasted/burnt sugar topped peach/nectarine. The taste on the palate matches the nose except that like my previous experience with Glenmorangie, I get this apple seed/peel bitterness that kind of pops out at you. Finish is pretty pleasant, minus the lingering bitterness. I'd say this is more of a dessert dram paired with a fruit pie or cobbler, or creme brulee."

3.0,"Can actually smell port and chocolate on the nose. Very smooth and light, general sweetness, a bit of spice. Surprisingly warm in the chest. Slightly bitter aftertaste in the back of the throat. Not as sweet as I thought it would be, but reminiscent of a candy cane during the holidays. Pleasant and accessible. 1/17/17"

3.0,"After a cold night at work and heading into my only weekend off for the entire month of December, it's time to open something new.  I've got a few more smoked scotch open right now so I need to balance the bar a bit.  Time for something non-Macallan, and sweet.  The Glenmorangie Milsean Private Edition.  It comes in at a robust 92 proof and if I recall correctly I paid just over $100 online for this bottle back in the spring of 2016.

It's a vibrant, golden yellow and leaves very oily, long legs in the tasting glass.  The nose seems very familiar-  lots of candied corn, cotton candy and vanilla and it's so sweet there's no oak barrel left to detect.  It smells like an above average, American bourbon.  Interesting.

The first sip is more candy corn and milky powdered sugar that hangs onto the tongue for what seems like an eternity.  I think I felt a new cavity forming.  This is way too sweet.  The finish does bring a bit of a welcoming burn of toasted oak to wash all the candy away, but even that seems a little muted.  Just a quick flash of heat and oak and then it winds out with more sugary residue clinging to the tongue.  It's so ridiculous that it seems like artificial sweetener- and not at all in a good way.

I added a bit of water (more than just a drop) to see if I can break the sweetness up and reveal something else- it did nothing to the nose, but did allow the oak to come through a bit more on the tongue and finish.  Thankfully.  

Final thoughts are that maybe this is their impression of an American bourbon, but based on the high price point and the fake tasting candied profile, it is a fail.  There are $30 bourbons in this country that would beat this whisky on the playground and steal it's lunch money.

Sadly, this is another dud IMO from 'Morangie.  I'm at the point with this place that I only want small doses of Quintan Ruban and La Santa going forward.  I've spent a decent amount of money on this distillery and I've had too many duds to recommend them and no desire to try their new offerings.  Live and learn, I guess.  2.75 stars.  Cheers, friends."

3.0,"Stop number 8 on the SDT is Glenmorangie. I have had all 4 of their core range offerings; the Original 10 YO, Lasanta, Nectar D'Or, and one of my favorites, the Quinta Ruban. I enjoyed all four of these, let's see if the Milsean (pronounced mill-shun, which is Gaelic for ""sweet things"") can hold its own. This Highland single malt is a NAS, but I suspect it is in the 10-12 year old range. It is finished for two and a half years in Portuguese red wine barriques, not to be confused with Port wine. What's the difference?  Glad you asked. Both are made using the same type of grapes, but port wine is a fortified wine, meaning it has brandy added to it to raise the ABV. This scotch comes in at 46% ABV, is non chill filtered and natural color of honey gold. 

The nose is rather light and subdued with a surprising alcohol presence on the first sniff. Nothing too bad, but more than expected for a Glenmorangie. Faint cotton candy and sugary toffee are the first real notes I detected. Flat cola comes in next. There is a definite bourbon type presence, but more like an empty glass after finishing a cheap bourbon. Some light stone fruits in there as well like apricots and nectarines. Really a weak nose and not too exciting. 

The palate could not be any different than the nose. Incredible how intense and robust it is after struggling with the scents. Spicy at first, a spice that really intensifies in the first few seconds on the tongue. After swallowing the spice quickly changes to a fruity sweetness. Wonderful fruit juices like mango, plums and sugary grapefruit. Some light alcohol harshness on the back end but nothing to really detract from the experience. I don't want these tastes to end!

Sadly they do end, and somewhat abruptly. The finish is fairly short. Dry but sweet and a bit spicy. The mouthfeel is lightly oily and a little creamy and quite mouthwatering. 

This is much like the Nectar D'Or in that the palate is much more intense and interesting than the nose, however the nose on this Milsean is weaker. Tough to score this one. 3 for the nose, nice but weak. 2.75 for the finish, too short but otherwise good. 4.25 for the palate, intense and unexpectedly fruity. 3.5 overall. Although if I were to factor in the price ($100 locally) I would drop it down to 3.25. A big thanks to Pranay for this and the other two samples he provided for round one of the Scotch Distillery Tour. Cheers"

3.0,"Watching the NY Mets fall apart in extra innings against the Washington Nationals (April 21st : Was under the weather since and catching up on reviews).  No worries, I will offset the slow burn with a Milsean; a scotch sourced to me by Pranay.

A floral, slightly earthy nose greets you.  Rubbing alcohol is appearant (maybe it's my feeling under the weather), cola and confectionary sugar.  The aromas are rather dynamic and no one theme adheres.  With a draw of the liquid, the palate is initially presented with a bitterness that is dry and spicy: sourced to the flavors of grapefruit, black cherry and oak.  Nothing like the nose profile.  Finally, grapefruit bitterness dominates and remains with some oak drying tannins.  A touch of water mellows the spicy side (tweaking down the ABV) which accentuates, on the palate, the buried sweet side.  Recommended with a splash.

A bitter and spicy profile is the foundation to this whisky.  Somewhat static or non-flashy and shallow, like the 2017 NY Mets.  However, it does start to become less ""restricted"" in good time.  The Glenmorangie range has never been keen to my taste.  For me, I have found them average with glimpses, but nothing memorable.  [84/100][Tasted: 4/21/17]"

4.0,"Wonderful packaging, fantastic drinkability, but sadly it doesn't live up to it's name. Instead of ""sweet things"" what I could discern from this was essentially standard Glenmorangie 10 with a charred wine-cask finish (yes, I know that's exactly what it is, but what I'm saying is there aren't any unique flavors that I haven't tasted elsewhere in other wine-cask finished drams like Jefferson's Cabernet cask). I suppose it may have just been the re-charring of those oak barrels, but the aftertaste of wine is all but canceled out by oak and perhaps just a hint of vanilla. There's absolutely nothing bad about this whiskey, but it's not different enough from the original Glenmorangie to really sell me on it."

4.5,"Info: Ce milsean est l'une des 5000 bouteilles de la série d'édition limitée ""Private edition"" de Glenmorangie. ""Milsean"" signifie douceur en gaélique et se prononce ""meel-shawn"". Cette édition est une référence aux boutiques de confiseries d'antan. Le fût de maturation est un fût de bourbon et le fût d'affinage est un fût de vin rouge de la région de Douro au Portugal qui a été préalablement ""grillé"". Un 46% habituel pour la distillerie. La couleur est d'un naturel doré. On ne connait pas l'âge de maturation exacte mais on sait que l'affinage est d'une durée de 2 ans et demi. 

Nez: Jujube aux fruits. Des parfums tropicaux. Miel, melon, citron, banane et ananas. Mais aussi un côté beurre. Définitivement quelque chose qui rappel un bonbon crémeux

Bouche: ça goute le gâteau aux bananes nappé de beurre salé sous une touche d'amertume tel un zeste de citron. Vraiment particulier! Ce n'est pas commun comme champs aromatique! Belle texture! Belle pointe en alcool habituelle à la distillerie! L'intensité aromatique est parfaite et bien équilibré. En bouche ça se concentre sur le beurre et les fruits tropicaux. Une belle continuité de l'arôme tout au long et une chaleur est dégagé loin dans l'oesophage.

finale: Encore cette impression de jujube au fruits. Les petits oursons de toute sorte de couleur un peu huileux et fraichement faites. Moyennement longue (habituel aussi à cette distillerie.)

Overall: J'aime beaucoup cette édition! J'en avais entendu du bien et les notes que j'avais lue m'intriguait. Du pop-corn? Ce n'est pas ma perception mais je comprends que le côté ""beurre"" que je perçois peut être interprété de la sorte. Une fois que le goût se dissipe en bouche, on a rapidement envi d'en reprendre. On ne veut pas que ça arrête. C'est ""bon dans yeule"" comme il dirait. Peut-être pas pour les amateurs de sensation forte et de grosse tourbe ou de sherry-bomb. Ça reste un scotch aux arômes douces de fruit tropicaux. Vous n'aurez pas votre coup de poing au visage (peut-être?) désiré. Mais, vous allez avoir une avalanche d'arômes fruités de toutes sortes. Ce genre de bouteille ne conserve souvent pas leurs arômes douces bien longtemps. Une fois ouverte, ne rangé pas la bouteille trop loin. Bref, j'en ai assez dit. Un scotch complexe, original, pas trop cher, avec une belle intensité sur ses 46%. Pour moi c'est un 92%."
