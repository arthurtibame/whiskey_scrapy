5.0,"Wow, this is a keeper. Too bad it has the Beam name on it, it's close to perfect. Wonderful mild vanilla and oak nose. The vanilla and almond undertones pervade from start to finish, and the finish has almost a marzipan quality. Really tasty. I'll be coming back!"
5.0,"This is not 'harsh'. The nose is typical bourbon- vanilla and caramel and toffee. The initial palate is sweet marshmallow and sugar cane, underscored by caramel and vanilla. The marshmallow taste expands and continues, followed by nice toasted oak and hints of barrel char. 
This is worlds away from regular Beam White- this is a downright great whiskey."

I tried not to like it as much as I do, simply because you don't think it belongs up there with the likes of say.....a Blanton's, Hillrock or even dare I say ""ETL"". Don't let the name dissuade you...... this is a really great bourbon."

3.0,"Familiar pleasant Beam soapy smell. Slightly sharp initially, but overall mellow relative to my expectations for a single barrel offering. Wood, butterscotch, some bitterness on the backend. I'm a Beam flavor profile fan, and while those notes definitely exist here, they somehow feel muted. Adding a limestone water ice cube just mutes it even further, giving the bitter aspect more of a prominent place. Will definintely need to revisit this bottle (and I understand the variability inherent in single barrel offerings). But for now, in my judgment not only does Jim Beam Bonded offer a better value, I think it just tastes better regardless of price.  2/17/17. Tried it again a few days later, the flavor profile was better, not as muted as before. It's good for Beam fans. I still prefer Jim Beam Bonded, especially for the price.  2/19/17 
  This continues to evolve for the better, has rounded out nicely and developed more of the nut and cherry flavors that I like about the Beam mash. Jim Beam Bonded is still a better buy given the flavor profile I like is more apparent from first opening and especially given the price, but I am definitely a fan of this Single Barrel.  4/8/17"

3.0,"(Barrel #JB5423) Like the so-so album from a favourite band, this one's for the completists only. In theory, it's a great idea--what would the entry-level Beam taste like with all the nonsene stripped away. But in practice, all the nonsense *isn't* being stripped away, because most of the uniqueness is still being filtered out, pre-bottling. Smell is mainly caramel corn, a bit of semi-sweet chocolate, plums, creamed corn, slight cherry syrup, and nutty Beam funk. But it's all pretty restrained, even at 95 proof. And the taste is even more restrained: surprisingly muted in ABV *and* flavour. Slightly watery texture, more caramel corn, tobacco, a bit of sour milk, some candied nuts, bitter citrus pith, bitter chocolate, chalk. A bit gritty and tannic on the finish. On the plus side, the Single Barrel dodges the main problem I have with entry-level Beam (the saccharine sweetness). On the other hand, I'd much prefer to dish out the extra $15 or $20 for Baker's or Booker's--two high-proof Beam offerings that aren't overly filtered, and thus have some genuine character."

3.0,"There's nothing quite like a little bit of day drinking.  I've been putting away a few bourbon and Coke cocktails the last few weeks and I figured I'd seek out an old friend, Jim Beam, and see if it's everything I remember.  Actually, I found the single barrel variant of JB so why not mix a cocktail and pour myself a dram to review neat.

The Jim Beam Single Barrel program is still the normal 4-7 year old white and black label Beam everyone knows (and loves), this just happens to be hand selected barrels making up less than 1% of the stock that's also Barrel strength.  This is bottle number 5251 and is 95 proof.  I found this bottle locally and paid $32 for a 750ml.

On the nose there's typical sweet vanilla and caramel, heavy corn and charred oak.  The palate is more of the same, with a bit of orange peel giving a bit of zest to the profile.  The finish is relatively smooth with a nice punch from the proof.  It's definitely more vibrant than it's normal bottling, but I'm not sure there's a real reason to choose this over the normal white/black label.  Especially at $10-15 above the regular stuff.  

As a mixer, it's still Jim Beam with a slightly harder bite.  Still, I'm not sure it warrants a special bottling and increased price.  If you like JB I'd recommend sticking to the regular stuff and spend those extra dollars on something more substantial.  Cheers."

1.5,"If you’re into sweet bourbon, this is a good one to try! The nose gives off a bit of brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, and slight Peanut Chew chocolate candy. On the palate, it’s sweet on entry, smooth, yet spicy. However, I was disappointed that the finish was so short, but it does leave a bit of fresh oranges on the tongue. I think this is perfect for a beginner bourbon drinker, and for a single barrel, the price is a steal! $30!!!"

4.0,"I ranked this a 4 out of 5. An overall score of 90 by the expert is in my eyes very accurate. Let me divulge.  

Jim Beam is one of those brands where they have everything from apple flav, fireball cinnamon to the subtle taste of baby seal ass. Catch my drift?

I for one explored other whiskeys before coming late to the game with Jim Beam. I knew i would pass on all regular bottles but after a recommendation from a friend, along with a good abv and being Single Barrel i made the $50 plunge (gasp). It’s worth the 50 spankies. I drank through two thirds of this stuff in three days. The aroma of this one is delicious! This whisky has a 47.5 abv and has a wonderful flavour profile. This one tastes great neat but having a small quantity of ice really opens this bitch up. 

The interesting thing with this whisky is the after smell. Yes, “after smell”. I forgot i had an empty whisky glass in my basement and brought it up to the kitchen for cleaning. My wife noticed an aroma brewing from this glass and was able to nose caramel, vanilla and toffee like flavs. Not too bad for someone who doesn’t drink or like whisky. That tells you the quality thats in the bottle. 

I rate this 4 out of 5 as it could have a pinch more complexity to it but a judges score of 90 makes sense when comparing this to something of higher calibre like a premo Wild Turkey or Russell’s bottle. Grab this one for your collection!"

4.0,"Neat, Room temperature, no water added in subsequent tastes, from a Glencairn. Barrel JB6177.

The nose is vanilla with a bit of spice... cinnamon.  I do get a bite of alcohol in there too.  It is a full nose and can really get the olfactory glands working.
  
The palate is initially warm from the very first second.  You've got to swirl this one around the entire tongue to let all of the taste buds fire.  Surprisingly, I got very little flavor off the tip, where I was expecting sweetness to dominate.  Hold it in your mouth for a bit.  You will be rewarded.  As it settled in, I got a nice warm ""classic bourbon"" tingle... lots of caramel and oak.  More layered than I expected, a very satisfying initial sip.
  
The finish is not short, but certainly not long either... and a little spicy, but not overwhelming.  I'm getting that cinnamon again near the back of my throat, and vanilla / caramel warmth remaining on the tongue.  The oak is still certainly there too.

Overall this is a smooth, classic bourbon.  Easy to sip, simple, but just complex enough to be interesting.  I could see a lot of folks settling in on this one as a daily sipper."

3.0,"On the nose it smells like Jim Beam; caramel, vanilla, oak, spice, ginger.  Still reminds me of Root Beer with a hint of smoky barrel char.
-
To the palate it’s a little sharp to start, with sweet spice hitting first before some dry oak settles in with vanilla.  Sweet caramel, spicy cinnamon, black pepper, sharp ginger, vanilla bean, oak wood and some subtle smoky char.
-
In the finish I find there is an alcoholic tingle left on the tongue along with those sweet and spicy notes sitting on top of a subtly dry oak.
—
With a splash of water, the alcohol sharpness is gone, but none of the spice.  In fact, I think it got sweeter and spicier... the pepper note is lingering long after the finish.  More oak on the nose and palate as well.
—//—
Bourbon Mark:  83
—//—
For this one, I’d have to say it’s like the spiciest version of a root beer you can imagine.  That being said; tasting side by side with Jim Beam Bonded, I think I actually like the cheaper bottle better.
-
They’re both spicy, they’re both young, they’re both good... I like them both, but I think I prefer the drama of Bonded’s flavour profile over the peppery notes of this particular Single Barrel."
3.75,"Very good.  My particular pour came from a barrel that had a nose and taste like Knob Creek. The difference is in the finish.  Buy this when it's on sale.  Knob Creek when it's on sale. Enjoy.

3.25,"In need of a versitile Bourbon that I could sip on but also not feel bad about using as a mixing Bourbon, I hit the local grocery store. My intent was to either pick up Buffalo Trace, WT 101 or Ezra 101. After checking the pricing, it was down to this one at $28, BT at $25 or WT 101 at $23. Since this was priced well under the $40-$45 it typically goes for and I have yet to taste I just went for it. I am feeling like a Hot Toddy this evening but before I get there, I of course have to try it neat! I really enjoy all Beam products and am curious to see how this one holds up. 
Now at $28 it prices this one at about what I can get a bottle of Knob Creek, EC, BT and EW Sib. My rating is going to really take into consideration this competition. 
On the pallette it's all classic Beam, peanuts, toffee, vanilla and a hint of butterscotch. Mid pallette has a slight spice kick with a medium finish that features oak and cocoa notes. It's got nice viscosity and a decent hug. Very smooth and drinkable. The main drawback is it isn't overly engaging or complex. It's similar in quality to it's competition and for the $28 price point it's a solid value. At $40, it's overpriced. 
This is most similar to the EW Sib and it's a toss up as to which is better. The extra proof here helps, but the EW is a little more complex. It's a bit better than the standard BT and EC offerings. As for Knob Creek, that depends on your mood. Knob is more in your face and brash. This is more refined and nuanced. 
All in all I am happy with the purchase at this price point. At MSRP, it's a poor value (2-2.5/5). 
Cheers all!"

If the palate and finish matched the nose this would be a 5 star whiskey."
4.0,Jim Beam did a great job in producing an excellent budget single barrel bourbon. The nose is warm caramel and vanilla. The flavor pallet brings in more vanilla but also introduces some citrus fruity notes. This works great neat or in an old fashioned.
4.25,"I have been searching for my Jim Beam for some time. Not a Knob Creek, not a Bakers, not a Booker’s. I wanted a “Jim Beam” that I could enjoy sipping regularly, and not want to pound down in Old Fashioneds to make room on my shelf. Spoilers: this is my Jim Beam.

The nose has vanilla, cane sugar, and a bit of honeysuckle. Vanilla is the main flavor, and it’s well done here.

Body tastes of smarties, heavy vanilla, caramel, and dough. For me that dough is the chief connection to the rest of the Jim Beam line, but in this drink it’s one of many delicious flavors that work well together, not merely the sharpest note.

Finish is a nice shift to cinnamon, more sugar, and baking spices.

Extremely good for Jim Beam juice, and very surprising. This is by no means a favorite bourbon, or even a top 10. But for my money this is the best Beam product out there, and it isn’t close."

3.0,"This is a bottle of Jim Beam Single Barrel No. JB8387 that I finally opened not too long. This is standard Jim Beam mashbill of 77% corn, 13% rye, and 10% malted barley. At 95 proof, this particular bottle had a bit more ethanol on the nose which mellowed out after about 5 minutes of sitting in a Glencairn glass. In addition, the nose has red apples, vanilla, and honey sweetness. The palate is where this bottle differentiates from the standard white label. You get cinnamon brown sugar, a bit of caramel apple, some charred oak, and then a heavy hit of cayenne pepper spice that lasts for at least several minutes. The finish has a bit of charred oak and brown sugar but it's almost completely overpowered by the lingering hot pepper spice. I personally actually enjoyed the cayenne pepper in the finish and how it lingered for quite some time because it was something different from the typical black pepper spice I normally taste in most bourbons."

3.0,"This sample, courtesy of @dubz480480, was such an appropriate pick while watching last night’s episode of GoT.  This is not your smooth, elegant bourbon, but rather a rough and tough full onslaught of barrel char, oak and vanilla with a lingering spice with more of that char.  Out of the hundreds of tastings I’ve had, it’s been a long time since a whiskey’s made me cough at first sip and feel that burn down your throat.  This is strong and potent.  Not sure I’d manage a bottle, but I can easily see this in a mixed cocktail.  It can hold its own. And then some.  
Thanks @dubz480 for the generous pour!"

3.75,"I'm almost finished with my bottle and ready to give a review. I've been oscillating between a 3.5 and 4 rating for this depending on the day, and my opinion is sometimes colored by the $39.95 price for a Jim Beam Single Barrel when the other Jim Beam variations are all under $30 in NC. But, the closest comparison I can give in terms of price and distillery is Knob Creek Small Batch, another Jim Beam product I also recently bought and is available for $36.95. Between the two, the Jim Beam Single Barrel is a much better bourbon. I wouldn't recommend the Knob Creek Small Batch if you could only choose one. While Knob Creek has overwhelming alcohol and oak flavor, Jim Beam is less harsh with a very nutty taste. The spice/harshness difference has nothing to do with the rye, since they both have the same percentage of 13%. It's also tough to chalk it up to the minimal difference in proof, since Jim Beam is 95 and Knob Creek is 100.

This Jim Beam bottle is sweet and nutty on the nose and taste. I kept thinking of desserts with caramel and lots of nuts, and once I got peanut brittle in my mind I couldn't think of a better comparison. It also reminds me of generic chocolate nut samplers you buy at Valentine's Day. This is a pleasant flavor that gets old after a couple of pours, but I like to switch up whiskeys no matter how much I like the taste. I've enjoyed this bourbon and I'm anxious to try some of the higher priced Jim Beam lines like Knob Creek Single Barrel and Baker's in the future."

Still has a hit of ethanol to let you know this is real deal. Nice dusty polished oak, black tea, light sweet fruit and mild caramel. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but doesn't matter with this much flavor. Palate is strong hit of oak wrapped in candy apple coating. Plenty of char and some milk chocolate with almond, more varnish, tea and caramel. Finish is drying wood and char with some fading notes of nutty caramel. This is damn good bourbon. Im pretty sure this is Knob Creek single barrel with less aging and lower proof. Tastes like the same formula to me with less complexity and power( can get the beginning of the musky notes in KCSB). That's not an insult this is bringing a fantastic richness and value at price(low $30's) and is easy repurchase.........91/100......I must say if you enjoy this than you have to try the Knob Creek single barrel yo.....Update: the longer the bottle has been open the better this gets!!

3.0,"BACKGROUND: Jim Beam Single Barrel, Beam’s first offering in the single barrel genre, was initially announced by Master Distiller Fred Noe in late 2013 and began appearing on store shelves in March of the following year.

Though the bottle carries no age statement, Noe said at the time of its announcement that the bourbon would be aged between four to seven years and selected from the barrels used to produce Jim Beam’s white label and black label expressions.

According to Beam/Suntory, less than 1% of Beam barrels qualify for single barrel bottling, and each is “strictly hand-selected…with care to ensure a unique profile and premium quality that make for a perfectly crafted bourbon.”

While the single barrels chosen for Booker’s, Knob Creek, and, most recently, Baker’s come from the choice center cut positions of the warehouse, the Beam SiB barrels are selected from the top, bottom, and sides.

Visitors to Beam’s gift shop at the American Stillhouse distillery in Clermont, Kentucky could purchase and hand-bottle their own Single Barrel bottle, but I am unsure as to whether this option is still available.

Jim Beam Single Barrel is bottled at 95 proof and made from a mashbill of 77% corn, 13% rye, and 10% malted barley.  Though many single barrel offerings from other companies are non-chill filtered, this one does go through that process.

Each bottle carries a hand-written label denoting the barrel from which it was bottled.  My bottle came from barrel JB7244.

A 750ml bottle of Jim Beam Single Barrel retails for $34.99.

NOSE: The nose presents the undeniable scent of fresh peanut brittle along with navel orange, oak, and a dose of good, ol’ Jim Beam musty funk, which is one of my guilty pleasures. 

PALATE: The palate largely mirrors the nose with oak, orange citrus, peanuts, caramel, and, believe it or not, a bit of buttermilk biscuit.  It seems to be a very front-forward palate on the tongue.

FINISH: The finish is long and offers a surprisingly big Kentucky hug for a 95 proof bourbon.  The orange citrus on the palate becomes lemon citrus on the finish, perhaps because of some oak tannins.  Big, booming notes of black pepper are also dominant in the finish.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  As noted in my previous reviews, I am a big fan of Beam’s premium, higher-end, and more limited bourbons, so I had big hopes for Jim Beam Single Barrel.  While it is much better than the regular 80 proof white label Jim Beam, it is also not quite as good as the Distiller’s Cut or Beam Bonded.

Jim Beam Single Barrel is all-at-once enjoyable and unremarkable.  It is a flavorful bourbon, but not one that prompts me to rush out to purchase more bottles."

3.0,"There seems to be some confusion as to what is happening with Jim Beam Single Barrel. It is slowly disappearing form shelves in its traditional form. The Beam website shows a new upgraded  sloped shoulder bottle design with fancy cork closure at the traditional 95 proof. However, There are bottles on shelves in certain areas of the country that are the now standard square shouldered Jim Beam bottle with a screw cap. That's not the big news though. It's clocking in at 108proof and going for the low price of  between $17 and $25. There has been no official announcement or launch for either new product so it remains a mystery. This has been on my ""to try"" list for a while, but every time I've looked at it I've thought ""Yeah, NAS Beam? I think I'll pass."" However, with this being the last bottle on the shelf and not knowing what the replacement was going to be, I finally bit. Let's see what Beam Barrel #JB7214 has in store for us...

NOSE: There is a lot of alcohol burn on the nose for a 95 proof even after letting it breathe for 10 minutes. Working around it, you get notes of Nutter Butter Cookies, Dry Roast Peanuts, Caramel, and Vanilla. There is also an unpleasant ""Oily"" or ""Plastic-y"" smell that comes along with the burn.
NEAT: The Beam Peanut Funk is front and center. After a few sips to get adjusted to it you get notes of Oak, Vanilla, Dark Chocolate and Flat Cola. There is Bitter Oak mid-palate. Not astringent really. Just oddly bitter. It's a tick on the hot side on the finish with a decent building KY Hug. It leaves a thick coating of Bitter Oak and Peanut Funk behind. Let's add a little water and pray it gets better.
SPLASH: Not a ton of change to the nose, but the Chemically/Oily note is decreased somewhat and a Sweet Baked Pastry vibe emerges. Still, that stinging alcohol heat is distracting from the good that is there. It really does help the palate. That Bitter Oak is really toned down as is some of the heat. The aftertaste is now Sweet Oak and Sugar Cookie with just a small remnant of that Bitterness. Water is a must for this one.

VERDICT: A little Splash of Spring Water saved this one from the land of the 2's. I'll give it a 3, but just barely. Beam had really been on a roll with me lately with the new Knob Creek age stated versions. Hopefully this was just a less than stellar barrel. If it should improve with some time open, I will happily report. I'm anxious to see what the replacement ends up being here. Same old same old with a new bottle, or a 108 proof ""Young Baker's"". Either way, I won't be sad to see this particular barrel/bottle go the way of the Dodo."

3.25,"Well take me out to the ball game... that's my first thought with the peanutty nose here. More peanut and caramel on the tongue. Initial flavor fades to a bit of a harsh alcohol burn.  An ok pour, but not one I will be going back to."

3.75,"Oaky nose, cereal grains, musty field corn 
Sweet. Dry toasted white bread. Vanilla notes.
A little hot on the cheeks and the palate
Barrel char, tiny hints of cinnamon and nutmeg
Well balanced flavor profile.  
Really, quite solid"
4.25,"Nose: Classic.  You can tell this is Beam, but a little more swagger.  Vanilla, oak, char - it's all here.  There's an almost floral citrus thing going on - orange blossoms spring to mind.  Dusty corn, cheerios.  Vegetal and herbaceous - probably the rye in the mash bill poking its head out.  Earth, slight leather.

Palate: Again, that Beam white label heritage comes through, though a little more refined and stately.  That classic dusty corn character comes through.  White sugar and charred oak.  Mint, thyme, oregano.  Cucumber.  Citrus.  Very mellow sip.  Finish is medium-short with that slight rye spice showing up again, along with more dusty corn and not much else.

Other notes: This is a BevMo barrel pick.  Proofed at 95 so it's not going to slap you, but there's enough there to keep things interesting.  Definitely an interesting experience - really allows you to see and understand what's going on in a given barrel - great to compare to standard Beam white label and maybe even Knob Creek single barrel (proofed down, of course).  I might not get this again, but I'm glad I picked this one up."
