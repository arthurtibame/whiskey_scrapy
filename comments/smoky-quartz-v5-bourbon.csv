3.25,"I love exploring craft distillery offerings - so many unique and exciting whiskeys waiting to be discovered.   I particularly enjoy finding local or regional gems, and I have multiple bottles from most of the New England states, with the exception of Vermont and my home state of New Hampshire.  

Smoky Quartz had been on the shelves of the New Hampshire state liquor store for some time, but my curiosity has been tempered with caution.  With a mashbill of 100% corn, aged just a bit over a year (in New Hampshire nonetheless, which is not exactly on the Texas high-speed aging curve), this whiskey seemed to have the makings of a harsh and unruly youngster.  Plus, Smoky Quartz is currently making four products - vodka, moonshine, gin, and bourbon, but the bourbon appears last on their web page.  Perhaps not their crown jewel...

On Sunday, I went to my sister's house for dinner and she announced she had a local bourbon for me to try - Smoky Quartz, which she had received from a friend as a gift.  

Smoky Quartz is based in Seabrook, NH and sources all grains locally.  The V5 is 100% corn, aged approximately 15 months in small (15-gallon) barrels, and bottled at 45% ABV.  

The nose is full of corn and vanilla.  The palate starts with a strong hit of vanilla and caramel, followed by a moderate rush of alcohol that is not overly heavy and is tempered by a note of grassiness.  The heat and grassiness slowly fades and is replaced by a strong burst of fruit and caramel sweetness at the end of a long finish.

There's no mistaking the fact that this is a young whiskey - the spice and nuttiness found in more mature bourbons are nowhere to be found, nor is there a fully rounded profile.   On the other hand, the harshness is well in check, there's an interesting progressing from the palate to the finish, and there's none of the harsh oakiness that can occur with small barrel aging.   While it's nothing groundbreaking, it's a very solid effort, and I plan to visit the distillery soon."
4.5,"Sweet and well rounded. Not super deep or complex, but supremely drinkable."
