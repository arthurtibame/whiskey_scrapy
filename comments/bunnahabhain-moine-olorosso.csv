3.75,"I've been impressed with the bunnahabhain offerings I've had so far (Ceobanach aside). This one is a great sherry drop. I wouldn't say it stood out on the night with a handful of drams pipping it. Typical oily Bunnahabhain profile, I didn't even notice the peat just tasted a dirtier style olorosso to me but we had had a couple of fully peated whiskies prior. Slightly thinner than other olorossos I've tried. 3.75"
