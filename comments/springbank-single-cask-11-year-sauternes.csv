4.0,"Similar to the 10, but stronger (higher alcohol?) and some sweetness at the end of the palate
Edit: it’s cask strength, which makes sense. Tasted like CS springbank 10 with more sweetness/fruitiness but very subtle."
3.0,"Nose - savory, salty wine, brine.  This is the most savory springbank I've ever nosed, by  a lot.  

Taste - Hot - really hot.  Has that classic springbank BBQ peat, sugar cookie finish, then the Sauternes must be giving off that more salty savory notes or brings them out along with a very rich sweatness.  The sweat and savory is really enjoyable but it hides any additional complexity.  

The finish is medium, hot, and sweat.  I'm reviewing off a sample and I'd gladly buy a bottle at 150 or less."
