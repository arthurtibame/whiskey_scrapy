4.5,"Amazing.

5280 Whiskey Society “Nancy Nose Best”. Bottle 100/111.

Potentially magic juice? Creme brûlée and soft bread on the nose.

Palette full of pears, almonds, brown butter, vanilla, spun sugar and custard.

Finish incredibly smooth with a hint of rye on the backend. Lasts long and stupid satisfying."
