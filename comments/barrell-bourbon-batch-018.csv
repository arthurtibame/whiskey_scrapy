4.25,"Nose of vanilla and cinnamon with a slight burn off the nostrils. There's also a mineral smell to it, almost like wet stone. Having had Dickel, I now recognize this as the vitamin characteristic they're known for. The smell of oak underpins everything. Sweet molasses and wood notes with a red hot burn on the tongue. The heat quickly dissipates to a comfortable warmth, which lingers through the end of a mid-length finish. Left with sweet sensation that follows a red hot binge. Lingering mineral taste following it all.

This whiskey jumps around a lot, and I think it's due to the high rye, low rye blend. You get the rye spice from the Kentucky and Indiana juice, but then you get the sweet and mineral notes from the high corn Dickel juice.

It's good - unexpected, but good."

4.0,Small batch bourbon of the year but it’s a little off for my palate.... cinnamon on top and bottom. Spiced long finish but I’m looking for more sweet honey but flavors

5.0,"Notes of leather and charred smoked barrels hit my nose. As I sip, notes of smooth vanilla, and a hint of cherry resonate on the pallet of my tongue. Very smooth whiskey, definitely worth a try."

4.0,"A total cinnamon bomb that is a real treat after a nice meal. Definitely not your classic bourbon flavor profile, but delivers a bold and well rounded spice experience from front to back that I haven’t experienced in any other Whiskey. Overall I think I prefer batch 017 which is more in my flavor wheelhouse, but Barrell 018 is a nice trip to a special place."

4.5,"It's amazing tons of oak, honey and bananas hits of cherry and creamy caramel. The finish last for a long time and it just give you mouth a hug."
