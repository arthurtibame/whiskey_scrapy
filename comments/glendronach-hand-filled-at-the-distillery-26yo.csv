5.0,"After ordering a taxi to take me on an hour and a half trip from Aberdeen to the Glendronach distillery, the least I could do is bottle my own ""juice."" 

The truth is that it was an incredible experience, which is why I chose it to be my review # 500.

This Glendronach is out of cask # 218, which entered the barrel on June 5, 1992 and bottled it on May 24, 2019, that is, it lacked 12 days to be 27 years of maturation; something that is very easy to discover with the almost black ebony color of the whisky that came out of the barrel. 

The best thing that could happen to me is that I splashed a little because i poured too much, which allowed me to try it, to get the tasting notes and guess what? It is one of the best whiskies I've tried and I'm sure it will be on the podium this year for me. Bottled at 59%abv, in the nose of this ""monster"" I found: nuts, almonds, chocolate, toffee, ""colacao"", a tiny presence of peat and lemon. 

On the palate, it literally tastes like a thousand-leaf candy! It also has coffee, milk chocolate and Dulce de Leche; all wrapped in a spicy oakyness normal for a 26 years old dram. 

The aftertaste is simply sublime, with very marked chocolate notes, ginger, tobacco, peat and ashes. 

I rated it 101 out of 100, not only because each of those points are justified in the palate, nose, aftertaste and balance, but also because it gave me a spectacular experience, Sláinte Mhath friends!"
