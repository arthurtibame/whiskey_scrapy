3.75,Strong peanut smell and flavor. It is very unique whiskey. Sweet flavor. I tried a couple sips of it before having it in an Irish Peanut Butter Cup (a pint of Guinness with a shot of Sheep Dog Peanut Butter Whiskey).
2.5,Sweet with a hint of an alcohol bite. Would probably be great mixed with something.
3.0,It's alright. It's sweeter and more syrupy than skrewball.

null,"This is hands down the worst thing I have ever drank. The peanut butter smell was so strong, as to be unpleasant. It reminded me of walking past a Yankee Candle shop. The whiskey itself is thick and syrupy.  This is the imitation maple syrup equivalent of peanut butter flavor. The finish is bitter and distracting from any pleasantries that this may have has.  Adding water did nothing to improve the taste. All in all, it was a waste of a complimentary drink."
3.5,Way heavy on the PB... #CHEERS
