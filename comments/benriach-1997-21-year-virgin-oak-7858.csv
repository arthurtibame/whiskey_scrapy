3.5,"I wouldn't say Mondays are my favorite day of the week but this week it is as tonight I attended a horizontal Benriach cask strength testing.

The session comprised of 8 drams 1 of which was a mystery and the rest tasted blind. This one was the mystery on the night and although I usually love virgin oak this one didn't do it for me that much. And definitely not at $250USD a bottle. I was in the minority however as this placed 2nd or 3rd on the night."
