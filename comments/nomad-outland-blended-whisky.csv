1.0,Nomad es lo que en cocina se llama trampantojo. Whisky a los ojos es y brandy al beber. Para fans del brandy de Jerez. Mucha madera.

3.0,"Heavy sherry influence. Almost smells and tastes like sherry with some whisky. Dried fruits, raisins, plums, vanilla on the nose. Taste similar to the nose and is sweet. Very good, but not excellent. A little too much sherry and sweetness for my taste."

4.0,"[Whiskey Live NY 2018] - Quirky whiskey I would say for sure.  Its missing some wood spice and characteristics that you would wish for in a sherries highland scotch, but I would treat this more as a deconstruction project.  See the whiskey for what it contributes to others."

4.0,A bit spicy and sweet. Very smooth but not simple flavor.

3.0,"Oak, vanilla, and figs on the nose. The mouthful is thin, with a light taste of dried raisins on the palate. The finish is unforgivably weak. This whisky gets 3 stars because it tastes ok, but overall, it is a pretty bland dram."

4.0,"A remarkable blended whisky, with hints of caramel and dried fruits (particularly figs and raisins). The palate is similar to the nose, with a full syrupy body. The finish is prolonged and delicious. Again it's magnificent."

2.75,"Is this a whisky or a desert sherry? PX (raison flavor) overpowers anything the barley contributes. An example of what could've been a nice accent flavor instead taking center stage. But for ~$35, It's not too bad of an experience..."

4.5,"Wow! This is a really good and somewhat unique whisky, a blended Scotch in every sense of the word; but one, not legally-- having it's last year of aging in the warmer climate of Spain. According to it's website this is a blend of 30 highland and Speyside malts and grain whiskies 5-8 years old, then aged another 3 years in sherry casks, then is shipped to Spain where it is aged another year in Pedro Ximénez Sherry casks (not brandy casks as stated on Proof66.) Doing the math this makes the whiskies in the blend 9-12 years old. Poured neat it is a lovely reddish dark amber in the glass. The nose is honey, malt, and an elegant raisin like aged sherry. On the tongue all of these hold true. There is a sweetness to this dram, but it is not cloying like many flavored/sweetened vodkas. The finish is medium-long and slightly astringent on the very end. The aged sherry flavor remains on the tongue for minutes, not seconds. Not sure now how I first learned of this whisky, but am really glad I found it. No distributors seem to carry it in my part of the Midwest. (Lots of phone calls and asking the big stores to special order it for me.) Finally mail-ordered from a California store. Ordered a mixed case of whiskies so the shipping per bottle would not be prohibitive. With shipping included this ran me $40. I suppose some folks would think this whisky is a gimmick, but I think I get it. Taking the whisky to the FRESH aged sherry casks will deliver the most flavor and avoids the chance of the sherry casks souring in shipment to Scotland and thus delivering that dreaded ""baby-puke"" note in some sherry finished Scotches. The Whisky Vault guys on youtube really liked this. (Yes, I wanted some confirmation this was good before I spent my bucks.)"

4.25,"Bought a 50ml bottle to taste after touring the Bodega Top Pepe in Jerez out of curiosity. Very nice nose of raisins, vanilla almonds. Smooth on palate with dried figs and PX sherry. Will definitely try to find a full bottle to pack away to bring before leaving Spain since it is not available in the States."

3.0,"To sum it up in two words - raisin brandy.  That may not sound a lot more appealing than Raisin Bran, but if you like sweet drams, raisins, and/or brandy, this might be a winner.  To my palate, it's extremely sweet (practically liqueur sweet) and not particularly complex.  I can't say that I love it, but it's a unique dram."
