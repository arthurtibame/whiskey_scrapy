5.0,This is a hidden gem. Doesn't get too much attention which means there's more for me. It's an excellent select whisky that is mellow and smooth. Drink it neat and the whisky simply disappears in your mouth leaving behind notes of oak and vanilla. Drink it on the rocks and more aroma is released making a whisky that is full of flavor almost effortless to drink. It still has enough bite to remind you that you're drinking whisky but leaves aside the burn for other makers to give to their fans.

First sip was lightly bitter, with spice.  Recommend with the ice cube.  It's a sipping whiskey so recommend room temperature after the single cube melts.  Easy to drink and really enjoyable.  Kind of reminded me of TX whiskey."

4.0,"This is good! I'd give it 4.5 if we could give 1/2's. Nice light copper color. Dried bananas and burnt popcorn on the unique nose, with a hint of cinnamon and brown sugar. Neat it starts out with char and banana cream (I pick up the banana cream on all Dickels), followed by buttered popcorn and hazelnut. Just a hint of warmth going down, but this one is overly smooth. Hazelnut lingers on the palate. This one would probably get 5 stars if it were about $10 cheaper and they replaced the rubber stopper with real cork. This one is headed to the back of the cabinet for special occasions."

That stuff is to die for, and you should track it down. I'm migrating my old review to the right product, and giving the real Barrel Select a visit. Suffice it to say this was a happy little accident, however! The nose on the real deal is warm and inviting, with caramel popcorn, banana, chocolate, and woody spice. The palate is a humdinger - the perfect amount of sweetness, with ripe cherry, vanilla, buttery popcorn, a little chocolate, and baking spices. The finish lasts a nice little while. I'm keeping this at five stars; it's still everything I could ever want in a Tennessee whiskey and a really good value at less than $50. Now, the big question - is it better than the Hand Selected Barrel? That might require a side-by-side sampling...hmm, challenge accepted."

4.0,"[6.24.18] I've had this bottle for a few years and figured it was time to see how good it really was. Verdict is in from me and the boys at Select Sires: A grade. This is a fine red headed step child to big brother Jack. For the price, it's the best value Tennessee whiskey there is. 

Easy drinker, take it neat. It is lightly floral but tastes more like honey sat in charcoal before being turned into liquor. Definitely more fruit flavors come out as it cools off. Yes, there's vanilla but imagine more like if you warmed up the vanilla extract bottle. You can find a bit more spice if it warms up in the open for a while. I wonder if my palate is out of practice because I'm not picking up any cocoa or banana."

3.75,"More oak on the nose than the ""other"" Tennessee whiskey, but with the signature banana and vanilla notes expected from Bourbon.

It's nearly as smooth on entry as Gentleman Jack (unlike its more expensive Kentucky counterparts).  Sweet, but not overly sweet, unlike its competitor (all variations).  Moderately balanced (although not as well executed as the more high end Kentucky offerings), with equal parts charred oak and banana spice, with notes of caramel, and a hint of chocolate covered cherries.  The finish warms with a white pepper that is surprisingly dry, given the sweetness on the beginning/mid-pallate.

I would compare this to JD Gentleman Jack (or even single barrel), relatively speaking, as the difference between hot wings using real peppers/chiles vs artificial spicing.

This could join Naked Grouse as a budget daily drinker, except Maker's Mark cask strength is FAR superior while being close to the same price.  However, the MMCS is high ABV, and the Dickel is Smoove, and would make good cocktails."

3.75,"Tasted neat from a rocks glass. The pour is a rich gold with notable sheeting and legs. I expect a rich mouthfeel. 

On the nose this is vanilla and honeysuckle. Sweet and rich. There's a trace of butter, caramel and light oak.

This is super gentle on the palette. Creamy and rich as promised. Sweet with creme brulee, vanilla and nougat. 

Almost no heat, very little pepper. 

There is the expected Dickel bananas foster undertone and slight mineral notes.  I'm not sure what Flintstones vitamins taste like, as it's been since sometime in the 1960's that I last needed a children's chewable vitamin.

This is very tasty, but a bit boring. Its really easy to drink. In many ways it reminds me of Templeton The Good Stuff. Not in flavor but in how I react to it. It's just easy to drink without thinking about it. And clearly this is GD's answer to Gentleman Jack.  

It's a lovely quaff for a whiskey newbie, or someone moving into bourbon for the first time. No one will complain about this in their glass, its delightful.  

That said I still prefer the bottled in bond expression.  It has a bit more oomph, real personality, a lot more complexity and it should be almost $10 less expensive."

3.5,"BACKGROUND: First produced in 1964, George Dickel has always been the Jan Brady to the Marsha known as Jack Daniel’s.  In fact, the brand was started after Schenley Distilling Company attempted and failed to purchase Jack Daniel’s and decided, instead, to create a competitor.

Unlike the popular Old No. 7, however, Dickel has struggled in the market at times, and, when its supply of whiskey exceeded its demand in the 1990s, production at the distillery was completely shut down until later resuming operations in 2003.  

George Dickel, the whiskey’s namesake, was a German immigrant who operated a liquor store in Nashville from the mid-to-late 1800s.  A rectifier, he bought whiskey from several distilleries, mingled them together, bottled them under another name, and sold them in his store.  He tended to like the whiskey from the nearby Cascade Distillery and ended up buying that whiskey exclusively.  

Eventually acquiring a controlling interest in the distillery, Dickel sold its product as “Cascade Whisky-Mellow As Moonlight.”  In the 1960s, when Schenley built a production facility near the site of the original distillery that Dickel had owned in Cascade Hollow, located near Tullahoma, the new brand was named after him.

The Barrel Select has always been considered the top shelf offering of the Dickel brand, and, according to the distillery, each distinct batch is made from a blend of just ten barrels that are handpicked by the master distiller after aging between 10 to 12 years.

NOSE: The Barrel Select offers a delightful nose that smells exactly like buttered popcorn.  Bananas and caramel are present, as well, along with the omnipresent scent of Flintstones chewable vitamins for which Dickel is universally known - and which I actually enjoy.

PALATE: A great cornbread flavor jumps first onto the palate and is followed  with traditional caramel and oak notes.  The Flintstones vitamin that is present on the nose transfers into the same flavor reminiscent from childhood, and, again, I find it oddly pleasurable.

FINISH: The Barrel Select finishes much hotter than an 86 proof whiskey and offers just a brief pop of rye spice on the finish.  The corn, caramel, and oak flavors stick around and take some time to dissipate.  

FINAL ASSESSMENT: And old and politically incorrect joke goes - What do mopeds and fat chicks have in common?  They’re both fun to ride until your friends catch you on top of one.  

That joke pretty much sums up my feelings about George Dickel products.

I enjoy the Dickel brand and understand that many whiskey “connoisseurs” will subject me to much ridicule and derision for publicly stating as much.  That reaction is prompted, in my opinion, by the fact that many judge Dickel products based upon their own preconceived notions of the brand rather than by the merits of the whiskey in the glass.

Though only 86 proof - I tend to like my brown juice with a little higher octane - the Barrel Select is a perfectly balanced and pleasing whiskey that would make an excellent daily sipper."

3.5,"Someday I'll regret typing this. My Mother's Family is from TN. Try as I might, I seem not to enjoy Tennessee Whiskey as much as traditional Bourbon. I can't definitively say it's the charcoal filtering, but my thoughts are consistent and I would love to be predisposed to love it.  Light Gold/amber color. Aroma of corn. I've never said it, but it's what I smell. Honey sweetness and some oak.  Later after tasting I thought of Captain Crunch cereal. Quite oily. Flavor continues with corn, spearmint, honey, touch of banana at one moment. Don't add water. More corn front and center."
4.0,"I'm still far more appreciative of bourbon than Tennessee whiskey, but this has my attention.  I'll rate it compared to other Tennessee whiskey, rather than comparing it to bourbons...
Pale golden with reddish hues
Very sticky, slow moving legs
Nose is dominated by grain bill...  Hints of corn and rolled cereal grains.  Notes of cinnamon and orange peel.
Soft mouthfeel, good warmth and spice on the sides of the tongue are first wave.
Long finish with some barrel notes, dry oak and more flaked cereal grains. Almost no sweetness other than from the hint of burnt caramel"

null,"Lingering bite, what little flavor that's there isn't very good. Never again."
4.25,Really enjoyable. Smooth and simple with the right amount of kick. Actually hard to find in NJ but I really enjoy this for the price ($35 in NJ) and think it is a tremendous value.

4.5,"Nose is a little off tonight, so partially from memory as this is the bottom of the bottle. 

Sweet fruit and honey. Nutty. Background banana. Peanut butter and chocolate on the palate. Reminiscent of a candy from childhood, but I can't place it - Reese's Pieces maybe. Also fruit, wood, and smoke. Spice and slight tannic bitterness (not unpleasant) on the finish. 

Very tasty. More here than I can get tonight. Exceptional for the price."
