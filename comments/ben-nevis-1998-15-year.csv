1.75,"Cask number 596. Well on the good side it didn't taste like 56.1%. And that's where the good stops. It was a weird flavour, rubber, tainted almost sour sherry. I think the cask was stuffed. Others have rated highly but I shared this sample with a mate and we both tipped it down the sink so wasn't just my taste buds having an off day. 1.75"
