3.5,"The nose is immediately wrapped in cereals soaked in wine (try it!), accompanied by lots of orange, honey, raisins. The profile is very warm, soft and sweet, at times almost cloying. Christmas is already a memory now, but at times it almost makes one think of the typical Italian cake, panettone.
On the palate alcohol makes itself felt more than it should, and flows into the mouth with a certain astringency. The sweet profile from the smell here is dampened by an underlying acidity that breaks the balance in a disordered way: candied orange, yellow fruit and alcohol, almost (God forgive me) a hint of grappa. Something went wrong, the promises of the smell are broken and you feel a little almost betrayed.
The finish is medium, cereals return along with alcohol and orange."
