3.25,"I found this to be a surprisingly pleasant whisky for the price. No age certificate, of course, and given its deep brownish color, I’d guess that some of the spirits in the blend aren’t Japanese. Nevertheless, it’s pretty smooth, and I would strongly consider buying it again. Given how pretty the bottle is, it might be a nice gift."
