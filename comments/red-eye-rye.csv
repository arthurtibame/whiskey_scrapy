null,Pretty damn impressive. -Not a whisky for the purest in you - but as a fun sipper this stuff is pretty great; it really has a great great mouth entry - you eyes will widen like “wow! what is this stuff???” It’s extremely complex for the price tag - my only gripe is the sugary finish; which is to be expected with additives. This is definitely worth picking up for friends to share and sip on - a nice whiskey party favor.
4.0,Tasty!

5.0,"This stuff is delicious. Very versatile, use it in all Rye and Bourbon cocktails that you would normally make. Makes one hell of an Old Fashioned!!!  Also a great sipping whiskey."
5.0,"As a rye lover, I had to try. Coffee and rye sounded interesting but I wasn’t sure. Turns out it is a perfect match. Smooth and bold, with nice rye spice. I have tried it neat and made a coffee old fashioned. Great product."

I enjoy it split 50/50 with fernet over ice, the flavor profile is very versatile that pairs really good with citrus, bitters and it’s also very smooth straight or on the rocks."
5.0,"Well balanced, semi sweet, real coffee taste. Great after dinner sipper and makes a great Old Fashioned!"
2.5,"Nose: Deep caramel, Swedish fish, coffee, and a smoky char. However, in some instances I found an inescapable note of formaldehyde that was really off-putting.

Taste: sugar-free cherry coke, worthers coffee caramel, molasses, barrel char"
