4.0,Some honey with strong spirit on the nose. Lighter on the palate with some spice. Long finish with hint of pears. Adding water brings out dried fruit character on the nose and spice on the finish
4.0,"The nose is light and fruity, with hints of peach, apricot, and raisin. The tongue is sweet, with caramel, butterscotch and honey notes. The finish is long with a gentle buttery quality. A well balanced scotch, and a welcome addition to my  collection."
5.0,Fremragende afrundet bourbon med sherry finish. Nøddeagtig eftersmag.
5.0,"An amazing whisky. Vanilla almost crème brûlée on the nose. Super smooth in the palate, sweet and subtle Christmas spices at the front, smooth smooth smooth in the middle and a little strength to finish. A seductively sweet smooth whisky that goes down easy but the 57.6% cask strength hits  unexpectedly like a sledgehammer"

3.0,"Predominantly floral, with some hints of brown sugar, but otherwise an underwhelming nose. Warm and oily mouthful, with toffee, wine must, candied apple and citrus notes on the palate. The finish is remarkably short. Uninspired and disappointing considering the age and price of this bottling ($600 CAD)."
3.0,"95%??? That's quite generous. 

Considering the ABV and especially the price point, the nose is underwhelming. Sure water helps, but unless you're Moses the H2O ain't offering miracles. The palate has notes of black tea, butterscotch, some apple, and wine must.

Speaking of must, you must save your money and skip this one."
