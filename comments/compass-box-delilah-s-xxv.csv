4.0,"A typical speyside, nothing super super incredible, but very far from bad. Reminds me a lot of Glenlivet 18 in terms of tasting notes which in general is cheaper so I will stick to it. Won't buy another bottle, but definitely not upset with the purchase or would shy away from letting others try it."

4.0,A nice sherried dram with oak spice on the backend. A solid whisky. No surprises.
4.0,"Compass box has yet to disappoint me. Sweet, but more of powder sugar than red fruits though they are definitely still present. Spice vamps up in the finish and dies quickly leaving a medium sherry finish"
4.0,"Neat, this one is pretty light and subtle, almost like, gasp, Glenlivet. A couple of drops of water makes the nose come to life and the sherry influence becomes more pronounced. However, the palate loses something with the water."

3.0,"The label is unfortunately hideous. The nose, on the other hand, is quite nice. It has standard Scotch elements like mild sea spray with an emphasis on brown sugar, vanilla, and cherry. It smells delightfully rich and indulgent with a nice balance and clear flavors - you know, like the hedonism is supposed to be. The palate is surprisingly herbal with an unfortunate bitterness stepping in. It isn't a nice anise or smokey flavor so much as it is.jist bitter herbs. There's a slight mintiness, but not much. The other flavors are nicely rounded though with plenty of sea spray going on and a full sweetness. It's moderately rich. There are nice plum notes, though they are a bit obscured. With the herbs there just unfortunately something a bit off here. There's not in-your-face alcohol flavor, but those herbs are a real nuisance. There are some very good flavors in here, but there isn't anything amazing and there is that bad backing that can't be escaped. It's fairly creamy (though not to the extent that Compass Box Hedonism is). It also has an exceedingly oily mouthfeel. Unfortunately, it's kind of like the tremendous sweetness was tossed in to counterbalance the bitter herbs and the result is discordant. I could sip this, but I'd prefer not to."
4.0,"Nice fruity malt, with red fruit on the nose. Vanilla and the obvious cherry cask is there, together with lighter notes of red apples, spices like cinnamon, and I think I smell a hint of banana. The nose is surprisingly sharp for a 46% ABV whisky.
The taste is rich and oily, with dried confectionery fruit. Caramel and vanilla. 
I get mostly chocolate and pepper on the finish, which is long."

3.75,Sherried notes come through on the nose in addition to some sweet elements. Fruity palate with more sherry and a medium/light body. Moderate finish - shorter than I’d expect. A nice drink but massively overpriced.

3.75,"The wife is heading to Chicago on business at the end of next week and I'm tagging along so we can spend the weekend in the Windy City.  It seemed appropriate to prepare for the trip by imbibing the sample of Delilah's XXV that I recently acquired.

I found the nose to be fairly mild - sherry, fruit, and malt.  The palate has more malt and fruit, and a heavy dose of oak.   It is rich, bold and full.  The finish is a bit hotter than I expected given the age of the whiskeys that were used, but not at all unpleasant.  

So overall, very nice, although it's more oakey than I prefer.  At the going rate of about $100, I'm on the fence about purchasing it, even though it gets a few bonus points for another great Compass Box label and a cool tie-in to Delilah's Chicago.  The bottom line is that I might want to spend my Compass Box allocation elsewhere.

Speaking of Delilah's, the wife has a business dinner the night before our weekend begins, so I think I'll head over to experience it firsthand.  Hopefully I'll come away with a good whiskey tale or two."

4.75,"It's hard judging a Compass Box Whisky, similar to comparing and rating albums of a favorite artist. I've never purchased a Compass Box Whisky that I would not hit the re-up button on. This one is no different. Open up the nostrils to sherry and fruity notes approaching the dome piece. Minimal peat and etoh on the nose as well. Lastly, hit them with the pie crust on the nose. On the palate, there's spices and cinnamon squadding up with fruit concentrate used as pancake toppings. The finish is what takes this one home, hitting different like the climax of a rollercoaster with a long peppery finish. Very satisfied with it and to try and have a bottle; much recommended to try. With that being said, many other, cheaper Compass Box Whisky's that I would recommend before this.

4.0,solid compass box offering. not too sweet on nose or palate but the finish leaves the sweetness hanging on your tongue. quite enjoyable.

4.5,"Tasted at Delilah’s bar in Chicago! Amazing place and amazing whisky! Liked it a lot so talked to the owner of the place (Mike), great guy, and he said I could find a bottle at the local Binny’s if I told the manager that Mike told me to ask for him. 

Went to Binny’s the next day and no CB Delilah’s XXV at sight... So called the manager and told him that Mike sent me there and a bottle just appeared from thin air... Ha! ;-)

It was a month ago but I remember this whisky being quite sherried, delicious and incredible smooth... So silky smooth that it quite missed the little extra punch that could make me give it 5 stars. (Maybe because there is no European oak in this blend)"

3.0,"Probably a 3.5. Tasty. Very Sherry forward, keeping a berry flavor throughout. Amazingly calm across the palate. No challenge, but not boring, either. Reminds a bit of cherry sno-cone."
5.0,"Superb complexity, harmonious blending of the sherried components. One of the standouts of the Whisky Show London 2018, despite the competition."
5.0,"This celebratory anniversary blend is self-referential in a unique way.  It features a substantial portion of whiskey that Compass Box bottled for Delilah's 20th anniversary, further aged in a refill hogshead.  Add to that a ton of sherry-aged single malts from around Scotland, and a touch of light grain whisky, and we have this bottle.  It's surprisingly affordable at about $100 a bottle and available at a few liquor stores around the country, if you can't make it to Chicago to try it at the bar it honors.  This whisky is what Macallan 18 wishes it was, a rich, complex, sherried dram that is worthy of contemplation and appreciation.  Expect to encounter some of these flavors along the way: strawberries, baking spices, cherries, caramel, honey, apple cider, pepper, cocoa nibs, and fruit-based desserts.  I'll cop to some bias against sherried whiskies, but this might be the best that I've encountered."

3.5,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I had a tasting last night where we shared a few drams with each other.  Light, sherried, dried figs and raisins.  I had this after Stranger & Stranger, so it had the misfortune of bad placement.  It didnt make it to my top 5 for the night. Thanks Richard for sharing this!"
