4.0,01/01/15 Nose is light and slightly fruity. No real smoky woody flavor. Very different than bourbon. Almost an astringint taste that may take me some getting used to. Better on the rock than neat. Floral comes through a bit but not sweet.

4.0,"This darker amber dram greeted me with a hint of peach and oak, both on fire. Going in, it was almost sherry, definitely smoky wood. Finished with a lingering caramel. Very, very smooth all around. A few drops of water seemed to add a bit of a spice. As a highball, it was rendered into an adult peach and apple drink (no judgment on that particular outcome...). To me, there was an odd (but NOT unpleasant) fleeting signature to the taste. I'm not sure what it is. It's unique."

5.0,"This has to be one of my favorites. Incredibly smooth and silky--""oily"" as many have mentioned before. That perfect amount of caramel sweetness and an unmistakeable smoke note. Rich and sublime."

5.0,i love this whisky! i find it to be similar to the balvine style. very good!
5.0,"This is a work of art. So good, so full bodied. I see it as a poor mans Highland Park 30 yr. or maybe what a Highland Park 30 would taste like after only 15 years.  It really benefits from a few drops of water."

4.0,Deliciously balanced; peat doesn't overrule the other flavors. The 20 year we tried at Genka Bar in Tokyo's Gotanda neighborhood was even better - a richer and more full bodied version of this. But for the price the 15 is no slouch.
4.0,Nice smooth peat notes with a subtle spicy and vanilla hint.

5.0,"Really rich and complex.  Yoichi is one of the only distilleries that still uses coal, so there's a very earthy flavor to this, in addition to the fruity sweet.  A real gem.  I've tried their 10 yr old and 15...the 10 has more fruit forward while the 15 is more earthy.  
Now that Nikka has announced they'll stop making age statements, I can't image the 15 to be in the market for long.  Wondering if Suntory will go that route too...getting noticeably harder to find the Yamazaki 18."

4.0,"Nose - Light peaty smoke, sweet salty brine, apples, honeydew melon.
Taste - Immediately a sweet briny smoke, light bitterness like that of an oversteeped black tea. Toasted wet seaweed, toasted oats and toasted malted barley.
Finish - Salty smoky seaweed, light bitterness like burnt wet seaweed, salted green tea caramel-like sweetness. Long lingering briny smoke. Light honeydew melon sweetness makes a background appearance.

5.0,"Yeah, it's as good as they say it is. Know what's even better? Getting the last pour of it, probably ever, at your preferred local bar. The bartender gave me more like a pour and a half because there wasn't quite enough for a second...happy Father's Day to me! This has pretty much everything you could want in a Japanese whisky, or about any other kind - a nose that smells like a cookout in a fruit orchard at high season, a pleasantly rich (but not heavy) mouth with the right balance of ripe stone fruit, pineapple, and mango with charcoal smoke. The finish is lingering and smolders like those coals on the grill do long after you've finished cooking. So, so good - drink it if you can find it."
