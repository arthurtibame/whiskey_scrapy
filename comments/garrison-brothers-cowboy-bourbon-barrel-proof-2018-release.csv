4.5,Warm maple sugar nose and taste. Copper and corn and toasted oak leather with slight spice
4.25,"66.7% That's pretty hot! Smelling this reminds me of walking through a lumber yard. Dried white oak, not the bark but the center. upon tasting, I got the sense of vanilla on the winglets of my tongue. mid and back palate draw smooth spice and an inoffensive finish. maybe the finish could be longer, but I like it week-long anyways."
