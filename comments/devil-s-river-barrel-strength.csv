4.0,"Melted Caramels, oily, full, a small spicy finish.

I like this one neat or with a couple ice cubes, not the best for cocktails in my opinion."

1.75,"Nose: Weak for a ""barrel strength"", if I didn't know better would say this might be White Label Beam or Green Label Evan, maybe just a bit more than that but certainly not much.

This really reminded me of some of the young bourbons I've tried from some local distilleries.  No real age or sign of craftsmanship.  Stuff made with the best intentions yet rendered nearly undrinkable by any standard of what constitutes ""good whiskey"", probably severely under aged and green and with little redeeming qualities.  

Even though this stuff is priced considerably lower than the average boutique brand, it STILL cannot deliver and thus you would be advised to just grab a bottle of Old Charter, Old Grandad or Ancient Age in it's stead. 

If you somehow wind up with a bottle of this, just stash it away for that inevitable ""company"" drinker who is just going to slosh coke and sour mix in it anyway.   Two dogs in a row for me and I promise the next review will be something worthy of your time."

4.0,"Nose: Vanilla and spicy 

Taste: slightly oiley, buttery vanilla taste. Sweet, spicy finish.

Great sipping whiskey, I wouldn’t mix, would taste good with a couple cubes of ice as well."
