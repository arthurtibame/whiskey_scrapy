3.75,This is good. I get dill pickle on the nose and the palate. Not very sweet. More savory rye. Moderate to long finish. Buy this one.
2.75,"I've had about 6 of the new riff single barrel rye's and they're all incredible unique and insanely good.  So with that said they're all REALLY different, but hey lets do this.

No real notes on this one, or even a note that it was a ""pick"" which is odd (labeling).  I bought this from a store that LOVES to brag about store picks too.  Anyway to the whisky.  

Nose - Cherry cough drops, massive caramel, oh a touch of red caramel apples, and way in the back there's a hint of rye spice.  

Taste - Red hots, oak, oh a huge amount of rye spice, maybe a green apple.  Water being added gives off a bit of a waxy note which I rarely get in a bourbon or rye.  The apple notes are a bit more red now and the red hots are gone.  

Lovely mouth feel, really complex, I know it's 4 years old and this isn't one of the better new Riff single Barrel Rye's but I'm fan boying on this one too.  I'm not a rye guy but they're doing something special here.  

I'm going 2.75 on this one.  3.0 for me really is a special score and I want to avoid over using it.  I've had a few of these that are easy 3.5's but this one isn't that for me.  I'm debating a 3.0 and it's so close but I thought I'd go a bit conservative.  If you like rye you'll like this one and I doubt the price is going to push you off.  That said every new riff is SO different, I've never had a brand with so many differences barrel to barrel.  I'm not a fan boy of their regular rye (can't recall if I reviewed it) but the single barrels just seem to be a hit after a hit with a few being stellar."

4.25,Simply delicious rye. Higher proof than the BiB yet somehow goes down easier. Lots of mint that’s balanced by savory spice on the backend. Really looking forward to New Riff releasing older age statements in the future.

5.0,"Neat.  Barrel 15-1941.  Spring 2019 release.  Such a bright, delightful nose.  Barrel proof (111 proof) but barely a hint of it on the nose.  Really fruit forward, berries  and cream.  Deep caramel too.  Hint of coconut.  I feel like I could search this and find something new every time.  I don’t recall a non-finished rye having this much going on with the nose.  

Mmm, that’s a good first sip.  Hot damn.  Texture is perfectly thick and oily.  Brown sugar and cinnamon blast the tongue, gives way to chocolate, hits you with the rye spice, gives way to caramel and vanilla.  This is a special barrel.

I tried Michter’s Barrel Strength Rye for the first time a few days ago.  This is significantly better.  After the first few sips, the nose is even more delightful now.  Well done New Riff.  Well done."

4.5,"New Riff continues to impress. Let's see how the single barrel rye stacks up.  Nose has soft banana bread notes. First sip starts much smoother than a rye has a right to be, but then comes charging forward with peppery notes.  Hints of toffee and caramel linger in the finish. New Riff makes some nice bourbons, but their ryes steal the show!"
4.0,Like eating pralines next to a hay stack. And some barrel spice the more you get into it.
3.25,"(bbl: 15-6611].  Bright dry beechwood & sweet aroma.  Nice amount & balance of minty rye-spice and barrel sugars.  Not much barrel char present.    I enjoy a lot of whiskies at barrel strength, but this one needs water/ice to bring out the flavors.  No substantial flaws but seems to lack something IMO.   I'd like to try this after 4yrs in a #4 char barrel."

4.25,"Barrel 15-6611, 110.8%, really enjoying this bottle, I think it can hold its own against Willett 4 year and much more accessible to me. For such a young distillery, New Riff has a bright future."

3.5,111.6 proof.  With a dash of water would be a perfect sazerac rye. Great flavor profile and step up from the regular rye.
3.0,"First sip: dry as a desert. Like attending a seminar on the history of Rye bread given by Ben Stien in a dry sauna, New Riff Single Barrel Rye lowers your human water percentage from 70% to a dry 65% immediately. However, by the 3rd sip, notes of dark cherries appear like a palette oasis. Add ice!"

3.5,"Barrel no. 15-5928

This rye is pretty potent through and through. Nose: Oak and rye
The heat starts quick and carries throughout. Very nice lingering flavor as well. There is a lot of char, smoke, burnt caramel flavor.
I ended up putting a large cube in half way through (which I rarely drink anything with water or on the rocks). This certainly helped open up a bit. 
Honestly, like it more as a cocktail whiskey."

4.0,"Nose is vanilla, caramel, oak, rye spice is there but subtle.

Taste is dry rye spice, berry sweetness, balanced heat, oak, and a bit of must.

Finish is long and full of dry rye."
4.0,Barrel No. 15-6611. Spice hits hardddd up front but somehow smooth on the backend.  Lingers awhile.
3.75,"Aroma -Boozey honey / taste - instant rye burn. Leather, oak and honey / finish - complex and long lasting"
4.5,"Taste: Oak, toffee, leather, char and some pepper and roasted nuts.

Finish: long oak leads to caramel, dried fruit and spice."
