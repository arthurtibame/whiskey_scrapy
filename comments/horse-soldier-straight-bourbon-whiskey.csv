3.25,"Soft on the nose,typical bourbon aromas. Super mellow on the palate, it’s good but nothing that really stands out. Short finish. 
Would be a solid choice for a new bourbonite, especially neat. As it’s not too bold or hot.
So in closing nothing special here, but it’s not bad either. My opinion.....leave it in the barrel for a bit longer, and you just might have something"

3.5,"Been a while since I visited this bottle

Nose - sugar, nuts, and fruits with some cherries

Taste - fruit and nuttiness right at the start and mellow out to a sweet end. Light pepper at the finish and rounds out with leather. Enjoying the taste of this one much more the 2nd go round

Overall and value -
This is my second time reviewing this bourbon and must say it’s more complex and better this time. It’s a cool bottle and story behind the label. The bourbon has a good flavor and unique nose. Solid choice for 35-40$ range. Glad I revisited this one."

2.5,"I ended up with a bottle of Horse Soldier straight bourbon because a dear friend wanted a bottle of Blanton's for a family event.  I had a couple in the liquor closet, so I offered one in trade for ""any bourbon that has a maximum price of $60"" because that's what I'd paid.  I've got a pretty adventurous palate (finally got the spelling of this right), so what I got in return was less important than having fun tasting something new.  

Horse Soldier has a pretty interesting story, is distilled in Columbus OH and is bottled in Florida.  As an Ohioan turned Floridian, it seemed right.  I drink the whiskey and not the hype or the story, so here we go.  Tasted neat from a glencairn and given a solid 10 minutes rest.  This is the last pour from the bottle.

The color is a bright tannin tea with orange highlights.  A swirl shows thin sheeting and fast legs.  The nose is carmelized sugar, cherry cough drops, vanilla and a note of acetone. No matter how many times I come to this bottle - even after being open for more than 4 months -  this has an unappetizing nose.   

On the palate this whiskey isn't redeemed, but it's a bit better than its first impression.  Its comes out sweet with a notable oaky, barrel note.  Cornflakes with light brown sugar, slight cherry, and black pepper. It starts creamy and quickly moves to thin, leaving a lingering peppery fade on the lips and in the chest.  It's not bad.

Which brings me to the $60 price.  Thats 25%  more than Wild Turkey Rare Breed and this isn't in that class of quality.  It's 25% more than Knob Creek single barrel and this isn't in that class of quality. It's 40% more than Old Grand Dad 114, and it's not as good.  It's thrice the price of Evan Williams bottled in Bond, and I'd rather have the three.

I rate based on a 2.5 being the exact middle of the bell curve.  A competent, but nothing special, whiskey should score a 2.5 and most will land between 2.0 and 3.0, as does this bottle of Horse Soldier straight bourbon whiskey.  At this price it should be better.  At least it came with a cool story."

3.0,I would rate this a good in between bourbon. It is nothing spectacular but has a good flavor with a medium bite but smooth which I always look for in a bourbon. Excellent story behind the brand and not to mention a great looking bottle. Enjoyed a glass neat and another on a couple ice cubes. Overall enjoyable.

3.25,"On a recent trip to Florida's west coast, I saw Horse Soldier in a local Total Wine.  It's produced in St. Petersburg by the American Freedom Distillery.   Although I like to pick up local offerings when I travel, I passed on it in favor of a bottle from Old St. Pete Distillery.

The wife and I traveled to New York for a few days between Christmas and New Year's, and found our way to the hotel bar after a long day exploring.  The hotel bar's whiskey offerings were not extensive and almost entirely run of the mill - Beam, Jameson, Jack, Glenfiddich, and...Horse Soldier.  Easy choice. 

Horse Soldier's mashbill is 65% corn, 30% rye, and 5% barley and it's bottled at 42.5% ABV.  The nose is sweet, with some typical bourbon aromas - primarily sweet caramel and corn.  The palate is more of the same, with a rye spice that builds to the finish.

There's nothing unusual, surprising or different about it.  But it's a nice whiskey - well balanced and pleasant.   I have no compulsion to jump online and order a bottle, but better than sipping Jameson or Jack? Absolutely."
5.0,Very smooth! Excellent sipping bourbon.
