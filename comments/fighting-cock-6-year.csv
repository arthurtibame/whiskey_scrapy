5.0,"Now if you have or can still find a Bottle of this in 6 Year Old then Grab it & all that you can find because all new stock has the 6 years old Age Statement removed & is made with a blend of 4-6 year old Bourbon...

Now this is a Heaven Hill - Evan Williams Product that is a High Quality High Proo (103) Low Cost Bourbon that is really worth your time & money!

Now I have 14 Bottles of The 6 Year Old but none of the new NAS bottles..."

3.0,"Nice deep color, much darker than most bourbons of this age. Lots of vanilla in the nose. A bit of heat on the tongue when neat, along with a great woody blast. Some caramel and other sweet notes come out with a little water. Mixes oddly well with Dr. Pepper. Excellent buy for $17."

2.0,This will get you drunk because it is very strong but it's way too sweet and harshly spicy. It's hard to drink. Cheap but There's better stuff out there.

4.0,"Nose - A bit surprised that this didn't hit me a bit more due to the proof, but it was more of a mellow, sweet honey with hints of vanilla. There's also this sort of artificial cherry/pear fruit snack waxy sweetness?
Taste - Hits the palate with the vanilla and honey, the fruit you get in the nose seems to disappear due to the initial sweetness and light oak. The higher proof then shows up in the form of a cinnamon spice, while the entire thing is suprisingly thin.
Finish - The sweet honey-vanilla fades to a slightly oaky bitterness that's slightly vanilla sweet and the proof lingers with the cinnamon spice.

3.0,"In my opinion, the best of the high-proof bourbon. It's original vintage was better, but the 6-year is still solid!"
2.0,"Very spicy, very fruity, and very hot. This has more bite to it than any 103 proof has a right to. Overall very unremarkable. Either spend $7 less and get Very Old Barton or spend an extra $5 and get Buffalo Trace. At $20 this bottle just isnt worth it."
3.0,"Buttery with a vanilla and maple sweetness. Lot of spices here as well: Pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg blend together with nice heat."

3.0,"NAS version. Alcohol and wood on the nose. Sweet and spicy up front. Caramel and mulled cider notes. Lingering white pepper. A bit rough, but the flavors are good. Almost like an unrefined Weller Antique 107. 6/25/17 Had it again. Nothing like Old Weller 107, hahah, but still good. Actually more of a Beam profile. 7/13/17"

3.0,"Nose- Cinnamon and a savory hint of cayenne pepper at first. After it breaths their are notes of honey but Cheerios. 
Body- Sweet raw peanut with notes of cinnamon
Finish- The sweetness gives way to black pepper, grass, and a bit of wood pulp

At 103 proof, 6 year’s old, $19 dollars I sure as hell ain’t disappointed. Cheers John. Thanks for the trophy Milliardo. Better luck next time Freeeeeeeedom."
4.0,"3 - 3.2 ⭐️.
Vanilla, light chocolate and caramel on the nose, which follows through on the palate. A little hot mid to late palate but had some sweetness to balance out the heat. Also picked up very light oily touch when drinking neat. Medium finish. 
Overall nice “rough & tumble” bourbon and great value for the price ("
2.0,"NAS version. Nose: Sweet, with brown sugar and Vanilla Coke with some oak in the background. Neat it starts off cloyingly sweet. Almost liquer-like. Vanilla, peanut butter, and oak. Spicy tingle on the mid-palate with a surprisingly smooth finish considering its higher proof. Despite a relatively thin mouthfeel, it leaves a nice coating of vanilla, mild cinnamon and oak. This was WAY too sweet for me. A splash did help some, but there are just too many other good choices in this price range for this to be a repeat buy. My dilemma is that this is so sweet, I don't know what to mix it with to make it palatable."

2.0,"This is certainly a FIGHTER!  At $12.49/750ml it was worth a try and expanding one's bourbon horizons.  It tastes worlds better with a rock than a splash.  You get all the heat you want at 103 with no loss of roughness either.  It is a working man's ""shot and a beer"" chaser after working a tough shift at the mill.  Very fun to try, but not for the faint hearted.  I will have it next time with an Iron City Beer.  :-)"

3.75,"High marks for the value here. At $18 I’m not sure if there is a better bourbon. High abv, great taste, some spice but nothing offensive. Reminds me of a less mature Eagle Rare. Would take this over anything I’ve tried in the sub $20 for 750 range."

3.75,"Run into this bourbon randomly while inspecting the spirits in the nearest store and it cost a sharp price. Well, I have expected nothing but a standard whiskey you usually get for such a price, but I haven't been disappointed by a purchase since the only thing I was driven by was a curiosity. And it performed high above my expectations despite having a quite tawdry and flashy cartoonish label.
Aroma resembles the one of Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon with tons of caramel, nuts, sweet spices, figs and butterscotch.
While the aroma delivers some decent yet standard notes the taste gives you a fabulous experience.
Fighting Cock is one of the sweetest bourbons I've tried so far. The taste is utterly sweet with many different fruity notes - there are peaches, apricots, even mangos. Some caramel, honey, nuts along with wooden and rye notes as well. This sweetness does not disappear at once but lingers for quite a long time and expresses the bourbon's rich and appetizing charachter.
After adding some water it gives a true bubble gum taste. Gorgeous.
Finish is long and spicy sweet again.
I liked it much and definitely would purchase it as soon as I find it for the same price."

3.25,"I bought this spirit on sale at the local state ran store.  I was told the 93 proof was to compete with Wild Turkey.  ?...Although I enjoy WT...this bourbon has it's own mellow bite that IS acceptable and worth the low price. I DO recommend Fighting Cock as an alternative to other non BNB bourbons.  Just the crazy name creates fun conversation, and is a good bourbon for cocktails....""FIGHTING COCKTAILS'!  CHEERS!"

3.5,A friend gifted me the last few ounces of his 6 year age stated Fighting Cock. It’s a much better bottle than today’s NAS one. Reminiscent of the 7 year age stated Virgin bourbon

Taste: lots of spice, vanilla, wood and a little toasted nut

Finish: spice, oak, nuts with a long finish"

Added some water, probably too many drops, which mellowed it beyond my liking. All in all, this is a super-solid ultra-value bourbon. 3.7."

3.0,"Here we have another bottle of cheap bourbon that I bought to drink with the neighbors and/or while hidden discretely in a travel coffee mug while rocking out on stage so I don’t have to pay bar prices for my drinks. Fighting Cock is produced by Heaven Hill and is their answer to Wild Turkey 101. It’s bottled at 51.5% ABV, or 103 proof, which makes it 2 better than WT lol. It used to carry a 6 year age statement, but that was done away with in 2015 I believe and now carries no age statement at all. HH still claims that it contains mostly 6 old year stock. It is a natural color of dark copper and despite its hefty ABV, I believe it is chill filtered as I have drank it with water and over ice and not once noticed any mist forming. The mash bill is 75% corn, 13% rye and 12% malted barley. 

The nose has an initial hit of mint, followed by heavily charred oak, wood smoke and strong rye spice. Toffee, caramel and butterscotch leading into vanilla cream, buttery corn and black pepper. Cinnamon, light bananas, beeswax and a mineral note (limestone?). Very herbal after resting a while, tobacco, walnuts and peanuts. Water brings out brown sugar, a little more banana and a chalky note. 

The palate is peppery heat, oak, lots of rye with cinnamon and fennel. Walnuts, but kind of like when you are eating walnuts but then you get a bad one...like that. Bitter orange oil, astringent. Water brings out corn, vanilla, and toffee. At this point it really becomes Evan Williams Black Label. 

Medium to full bodied mouthfeel, lightly oily, mouthwatering and fairly hot. 
The finish is medium length with oak, rye and mint. Dry. 

For a sub $20 bourbon (I paid $18), this is pretty good stuff. The nose has decent complexity with almost nothing off putting or unpleasant. The palate is not quite so good with obvious flaws, but to be fair I believe this was meant to be mixed or at least enjoyed over ice. I was surprised how much of the rye spice came through even though it comprises only 13% of the mash bill. Probably won’t buy again as I feel EW White Label offers better flavors for the same price. A solid 3
Cheers"

4.0,"Have had both the 6yr age stayed and the more recent NAS. Personally I’m a huge fan of the 6yr , you get a simple product that the things it does it does well! Surprisingly a nice blend of rye spice at the forefront followed by some oak and a nice finish. On the 6yr I’d give it an 85-88 out of 100.
While the NAS one is more brash, ethanol forward and it takes an additional 5-10 extra minutes to let it breathe . The finish is also considerably shorter on the new one . It’s not bad I’ll still buy a bottle when on sale for around $17 bucks but I wouldn’t search it out. 79-82 out of 100"
