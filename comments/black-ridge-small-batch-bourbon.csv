4.0,Really like the vanilla undertone.  A nice smooth drinking bourbon one of my evening favorites on ice.

4.0,Great sipping whiskey.  Smooth and nuanced.  Stays on the palate very well. I will definitely be buying again.

4.0,Neat; Sweet flavor with a touch of spice. Mild sweet & spicey finish. Spice becomes more intense during the lingering period then fades quickly with an undertone of alcohol.

3.75,Floral and vanilla undertones. An alcohol finish but overall not too bad. Tossed a rock into it and it muted the finish quite a bit.

4.0,"Neat, Previously opened bottle;  Nose is soft, floral, oak, and a little alcohol sharpness at the end.  The taste stays true to the nose, a softness at the start, floral, vanilla, red apple, then sweet, then a touch of tartness, alcohol, and soft cinnamon to finish.  

Definitely has the Barton taste. Very close to 1792 SmB.  Almost a Basil Hayden'd version of it. A bit softer and 'prettier', less heat, less sweet."

4.0,"I think this is a great deal for the price - smooth, mild, sweet, vanilla notes, light cinnamon, moderate baked spices.  Not complicated, an easy drinker."

3.5,Reminded me of a younger Weller Special Reserve (green label). Really light on the tongue and not a long finish. Easy sipping and hard to believe it is 90 proof. $28.95 usd

2.0,"Subtle flavor on draw, bite comes late and lingers for a short while. Not a ton of flavor over all. Not great, not terrible. Probably won't pick up another."
3.5,1 cube of ice. Great price point. Easy to sip with little heat. Hints of vanilla and spices.
