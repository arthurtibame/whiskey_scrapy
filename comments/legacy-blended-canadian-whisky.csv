2.5,"Pretty average. Impressive bottle at least -- it looks elegant. However, it's pretty light on flavor. It has the standard smoothness of most Canadian whiskeys with the sweet notes, but not much else. It's drinkable, but I would not buy another."
3.5,"Almost no smell, little taste. Tastes sweet, like white sugar and vanilla. Not much too it. Pretty perfect for mixing, it definitely won’t overpower your drink."

4.0,"A surprise to be sure...I bought this bourbon as ""pick in a poke...what the hell"" I'll give it a try deal...(we've all done it)....you SEE something new...the clerk say's ""it's  NEW here and on sale""  So....ya give it a try.  I, not being one to buy anything from Canada...OK....a few things....decided to give this a try.  The taste was smooth as most blends are. NO big one flavor stands out..but it certainly was enjoyable. I will share this spirit with all who stop by .  The price was more then fair.. The taste was a  3.8 and a .2 for a good price...I might buy again."

3.0,"Color: A tawny leather brown marks this Canadian blend. Also, the legs are the thinnest I have ever seen, but they do stick to the edge of the glass for a while. 
 
Nose: The nose marks a vibrant aroma that demands recognition. It’s surprising, for only being 40% ABV, it stings your nasal cavity if you don’t inhale with your mouth slightly open. Cotton candy notes lead the way with the smell of a craft store following behind. There’s a metallic note that I can’t decide whether I like or not, it reminds me of the smell of my summer job working in a glass and metal framing warehouse.

Taste: The palate has it’s sweet corn and buttery notes, but it’s rounded out by some spice as well. There are notes of almond and cashews, and a dry red wine vibe I get too.

Finish: The finish is medium to long in length and leaves a dry, tingling mouthfeel with a cherry note.

Thoughts: Though it may not be life altering, its a decent Canadian whisky I can get behind. I think their website can use some attention though; the graphics and vibe felt cool, but the site didn’t have any relevant information. (Sorta random, but I thought it was worth mentioning.) Anyways, Buffalo Trace, thanks and keep it up! Sláinte!"
4.0,"Sweet maple and vanilla, very well rounded for an under $25 Whiskey"

2.0,"Nose: very subtle vanilla, not much else. Palate: watery caramel, with some nice spice on the finish. Some citrus notes detected as well. Not terribly complex, but not unpleasant either. A bit of a chalky aftertaste. Adding water brings forth some spice to the nose, but really muted the flavors on the palate. Overall: Not a bad value, but probably not something I’d buy again."
3.25,Smooth on pallette. Slight vanilla hint
3.25,"Found this one on sale for $8.99 for a 750ml bottle. Yes you read that right, $8.99 for a full bottle. On to the review...

Smell is almost not there nothing sticks out too much on the nose a little sweetness but not overpowering. As I sip it I get a surprisingly, but not so surprisingly smooth touch on the front of my tongue followed by some floral flavoring. Not my favorite, but not bad.  Initially goes down smooth but I get a very large dose of alcohol backlash which is unpleasant. 

Overall for the $8.99 I would certainly purchase again. Even for the $20 regular price I would purchase this if Canadien whiskeys are your thing. Tasting this next to NH Crown it’s in a different league though...minor league that is."
3.5,"Almost floral with spice on the nose, maple vanilla on the palate. Very smooth, the heat comes later with a spicy finish."
2.5,Smells strongly like nail polish. Tasted much better with strong notes of caramel and butterscotch. Has a burning finish with not any taste and numbs the tongue.
