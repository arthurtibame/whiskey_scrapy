4.25,"The nose starts with dark chocolate and charred oak, quickly followed by vanilla, butterscotch, baking spices and a hint of fruit. The palate is somewhat chewy and dry with baking spices and charred oak coming on strong, while vanilla, dark chocolate  spicy rye and a slight leatheriness bring it all together. The finish is long with a lingering cinnamon spiciness along with charred oak while the rest of the palate fades nicely together. Not simple, but not complicated, making for a perfectly balanced bourbon that leaves you wanting to keep exploring it sip after sip."
