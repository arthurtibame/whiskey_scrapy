3.75,"The color is a vibrant gold which irregularly coats the glass with a nose that starts with a floral rye spiciness, vanilla, cherry liqueur, charred oak and a hint of caramel. The palate is somewhat rich and fills the mouth with a smooth rye spiciness that is balanced by vanilla, along with charred oak, cherry liqueur, caramel and a slight astringency mixed with cinnamon. The finish is medium long with fading rye and vanilla, while the astringency blends with cinnamon and the charred oak."
4.0,immediate flourish of bubblegum and bright orange on the nose. deeper inspection brings buttered popcorn chocolate and butterscotch. a slow burn on the tongue. light astringency. chocolate and vanilla. creamy and smooth.
