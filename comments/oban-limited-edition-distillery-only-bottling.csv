4.0,"Scotland, September 2017. (from notes)

Nose: Forceful, zesty, and fruity with sweet spicy complexity.

Palate: Fruity, malty and smooth on the arrival, turning darker in the development with subtle smoke and orange marmalade dancing with caramel, salt, dark chocolate, black coffee and walnuts. A very interesting and layered palate.

Finish: Medium-long, spicy, salty and gently smoky. Adding water released a lot of very hot peppery spice.

This Limited Edition NAS malt is actually in constant supply, but is limited in that it can only be bought at the distillery door.

Of the four expressions I tasted at Oban Distillery this was head and shoulders above the others. It has a much more focused and forceful character and is almost like a love child of the Oban Distillers Edition and a Bowmore.

If you are ever in the vicinity take the time to visit Oban Distillery and do one of their tastings, or just buy a bottle of the Distillery Only bottling. It was a revelation to me of what this distillery can achieve.

“Very Good” : 4 stars"
