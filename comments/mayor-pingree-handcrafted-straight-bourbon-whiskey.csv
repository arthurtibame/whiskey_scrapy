3.75,"Vanilla  and Brown Sugar Nose, Spicy Palette"
4.5,Clean and deep start with a Carmel vanilla hug at the end. An EXCELLENT bourbon from the people at valentine. It drinks like a pappy but at Detroit prices. It’s a sleeper bottle That will be highly sought after years from now. You will be impressed.
