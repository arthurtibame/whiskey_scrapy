2.0,This was interesting to say the least because I tasted a lot of vanilla and caramel first along with a bit of smoke and then an obvious fruit finish.

4.0,This is a very well-rounded scotch. Subtle yet full-bodied sweetness from the sherry. Nice grain notes and fruit as well. Apples and bit of honey. Great for both the experienced and novice scotch drinker.
