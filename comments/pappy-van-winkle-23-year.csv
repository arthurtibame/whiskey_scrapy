5.0,"We all have different tastes. But I have sampled, in direct comparison taste tests, 15 of the world's highest rated bourbons. Pappy Van Winkle 23 yr is, overall, my favorite. I can't seem to find a bottle to buy at a regular price, but it is readily available in bars. This and Elijah Craig 23 yr. are my top 2. It sort of makes me wonder about this site and it's tasters when they give an 89 to a bourbon that I and many other professionals give  from 94 up. So I look at all the other ratings with great sucspicion; because your tastes are so vastly different from mine. This is phenomenally good bourbon."

4.0,Warm and reminiscent of dried apricots on the nose. Smoky with hints of oak and fruit leather with the wonderfully full body of a long aged liquor. This is followed by a warm and very long finish. Now comes the bad part. Some say it is earthy. Kind of like truffles are earthy. I couldn't get over the thought that I was tasting moldy wood barrels. This is definitely worth about $100 if it didn't have that aftertaste. Not worth the kind of money being asked now a days. too many whiskeys out there that are much better in this price range.

5.0,"Love the maturity of the oak and vanilla in this bourbon. This is my favorite bourbon. Was fortunate enough to get it at retail. Would not pay the current ""market price"" for this. Bourbon is meant to be consumed not as currency. If you can't find it at retail, maybe try Noah's Mill. Not a wheaten bourbon and not quite as complex, but one of the closest bourbons I can think of as far as taste and palate go."

4.0,"Very close to the 20 but the flavors beginning to flatten. Unlike ALL of the reviews I read it's not over oak'd. Color is nice darker Amber and the nose has burnt molasses and fruit up front with sour citrus hiding underneath. Taste is a fading maple syrup and dry nuts. This is one crazy good, slowly aged bourbon, that's moved past it's prime. If you get a side-by-side with the 20 it will make sense."

5.0,"This was an unbelievable experience.  It's hard to understand how a whiskey can be this good.  A bit more oaky and less maple than the 20, but still a complex drink with a finish than lasts for days.  Gotta try it at least once."
4.0,It's good but not $120 a shot good. I drank it next to the Willet 12yo barrel strength and I'd say the Willet won the day for me.

5.0,"I had an opportunity to try this at a family Christmas party. 

The nose of this is pure gingerbread with hints of fruit and nuts. 

The mouth feel is oily and smooth. There is no bite to this bourbon. It explodes with flavors ranging from vanilla to a nutty oaky flavor. 

The finish lasts such an incredibly long time. And that’s a blessing. The oils continue to dance on your tastebuds and makes you want to go back for more. 

I’m not a whiskey snob, my go-to is a Macallan 12 or EH Taylor Small Batch. With that being said, this does live up to the hype. It was an amazing treat and I was lucky enough to get 3 generous pours. 

Is it worth $3000 a bottle? Absolutely not. Is it worth the sub-$300 MSRP? All day, every day."

4.0,"I walk into a bar that's listed on the googler under ""where to find Pappy van winkle Atlanta"" I sit at the table at Wrecking Bar and think ..this is the one...- this is the bourbon i have been waiting to try... Mama I'm affluent and sophisticated  enough to seek and try sought after world class coveted liquids! .... yeah..... I had many thoughts when I was pondering this pour.
  
  Nose: Best nose I have ever smelled - too many flavors to list.. really
  
  Palate: Oak - ****HOWEVER**** The oak in this one is quite a bit different than most of the oaky numbers you're use to; id classify it as ""GOLDEN OAK"" .. you know the idea of going to heaven? The ideas they tell you about the golden avuncular man that lives in the sky... and the light you drift toward after death? - its that kind of gold i speak of... golden sunshiny oak, unlike any I have ever tasted.... mildly sweet and balanced- yet the oaky flavor isn't overpowering its interesting and warranted ,,, or at least thats what I'v convinced myself after much ponder and money..  
  
  Finish: oily - not ""come to Jesus"" oily like one might expect for this kind of hype and money- but the flavor lingers for quite a while- many minutes.
  
 Cheers!"
4.0,"Oak, and cherry on the nose. Huge amount of oak and tobacco initially. There’s another flavor there that I can’t distinguish, but I’m not overly fond of. Finished with a lot of spice, and earth tones. Honestly, its good, but does not quite live up to the hype."

5.0,"Definitely the finest bourbon I have ever tasted! Depth to sink one’s soul into. Ten minutes after my second sip, I was still finding new flavors.
Toffee, cherry, candy corn. Touch of soft tobacco. Very sweet, but strong flavor. Medium smoothness.
DO NOT consume this with anything else — to pair with anything (except possibly water) would be a grave injustice. Closest second I’ve had to this would be the William Larue Weller 2016, which makes sense, coming from the same distillery. 
$200 for 1.5oz pour."

4.0,"Mooched a dram from a bourbon collector at a birthday occasion recently. 
    
    When it's free, it's hard to complain. That being said... As far as bourbon goes it was quality. Pleanty of earthy tones in the nose and on the taste, very light dark red fruit on the taste with a suprisingly bitter aftertaste. 
    
    The biggest downfall of this bourbon is simply it is a wheated bourbon. Line this up with 4 other wheated bourbons and the fun of trying a pappy 23 fades away as the flavor profile of the category is just too narrow to really stand out and live up to the hype it recieves. 
    
    Did I have fun trying it? absolutely. Would I pay the $300 my buddy paid for retail? I don't think I would. I would reccomend to people who really, really enjoy the wheated bourbon category to expeience a very high quality wheated bourbon. But to someone who has ventured beyond wheated bourbon I just don't see the value of $300 a bottle none-the-less a $300 pour.
