3.0,"Batch 3. Corn heavy nose. Hard to get anything but corn and ethanol. Didn’t taste as much corn as I thought I would. Chocolate, toffee, very little oak but it’s there. Sweet, slight burn mid way with a little spice. Worth 53$? Probably not.. a little young but not disappointed. Hoping it opens up with time."

1.0,nose- sweet caramel corn but like hay on the tongue. Like drinking country air.  Awful stuff
2.0,Over priced in my opinion. Uneven and just unfinished in my opinion a little more time in the barrel would help I think but look elsewhere for a good wheater
2.5,Overly caramel. Harsh alcohol. Not great
1.0,It’s good if you like drinking cherry sizzurp

4.0,Tea leaves on the nose. Pretty solid flavor profile with a smooth sweet tea vibe. 3.88.
3.0,"This is the newest, core bottle from Smooth Ambler, out of Maxwelton WV.  This is their “wheater” and I believe it is the first SA release that doesn’t use any sourced whiskey from Indiana contract distillery, MGP.  This is bottled at 50% and runs a cool $55 at the distillery.  I haven’t seen it on shelves here in Virginia, so I’m glad I grabbed a couple of bottles while visiting family a few weeks ago.

This bottle was from Batch 19 and is dark amber/copper in the Glencairn.  It’s pretty oily and makes some heavy legs in the glass.  The nose is pretty uneventful- even after 20-30min:  there’s no barrel, no ABV heat and very weak vanilla and/or sweetness.  That’s not a good way to start things off.  Happily, the palate picks up the proverbial pace with nice, sweet wheat and cinnamon while coming on strong and a bit harsh.  That’s odd for a wheater for sure, but after the faint nose it needs a kick in the pants and this delivers.  The finish is long and spicy with lots of warming, woody notes while ending somewhat smooth on the tongue and throat. 

Overall, it’s rough around the edges for a wheat whiskey, but it still delivers where it counts:  flavor profile.  This one ran a bit on the expensive side at $55 at the distillery.  I’m not sure it’s worth that price but I still recommend giving it a try.  Maybe find it at a local bar before splurging on a full bottle for yourself.  3.5 stars.  Cheers."

3.0,"High heat on the nose, vanilla scent.  Smooth on the front end, heat on the finish.  Still with a light sweetness like vanilla on the taste as well, along with a slight leather"
2.0,"Nose: dusty wheat, cereal, brown sugar.

Taste: mildew, with a hot finish.

All in all kinda a let down... the mix is just... off. It tastes young and bitter but with a kick of sugar like someone burnt your dessert."

2.0,"Free Tasting @ Total Wine.
I have been curious about this Bourbon and was happy to get a pour to sample rather than paying $54.99 sight unseen. For background this is the first widely distributed Smooth Ambler Bourbon from their own distillate. They are better known for their MGP sourced old scout line. This is a Wheated Bourbon (71% corn, 21% wheat and 8% malted barley). I received about a 1 oz pour. 
Right upon entry you are hit in the face with a ton of heat. It's very overpowering. Once that subsided, you get hodgepodge of notes that are hard to make out. This Bourbon is a bit of mess. Very unbalanced. It's not unpleasant per se, just not good. 
I've read people try and justify this by saying it shows promise. In my opinion at $54.99 you should get a finished product not one that shows promise. In addition this Bourbon is about 5 yrs old and bottled at 100 proof. This is enough age and proof for it not to be an impediment. Especially when you have other craft distillers like Koval, Few, Wyoming and Garrison Brothers putting out high quality juice from their own young and developing stocks (in many cases for less money).
This one is a hard pass for me. 1.5/5."

2.25,"Came in middle of the pack on Wheat bottle flight of 10 different bottles for me.   Heavy notes of toasted corn flakes on the nose . Palate is similar with heavy corn notes and wet burlap . Finish soften enough to show notes of almonds. Does have a long finish so if this is your flavor profile , then it’s worth a try . Unfortunately of the 10 of us tasters I gave it the most credit. So disappointing since I usually enjoy Smooth Ambler offerings"

3.25,Not a bad wheated bourbon at all. Has some sweet with a good finish and burn.  Oaky taste at finish.
3.25,I’m a fan of wheated bourbons in general. This one is quite nice but not great value for money.

3.5,"Typical bourbony smell with a bit of a musty note - reminds me of corn tortillas. Nice, tart sweetness up front. Pronounced peanutty flavor and long, oaky finish. 

Notable burn for a wheated bourbon. There’s no rye present in the mashbill, but there’s a spiciness there that could’ve fooled me. All in all, not a bad drink, but probably not worth the price.."

2.75,"Smooth Ambler’s 1st bourbon release that is distilled, aged, and bottled at their West Virginia distillery.  It is a 100 proof wheated bourbon with no age statement, although Smooth Amber says it’s 5+ years old, and not chill filtered.  The mashbill is 71% corn, 21% wheat, and 8% malted barely.  Aged in #4 char 53 gallon barrels.  This particular bottle is from batch 16.

N:  Pears, fresh bread, oak, malt, the “heads” cut, light hints of vanilla and maple.

P:  Initial sweetness is overtaken quickly by dryness and bitterness.  Light vanilla and maple - bitter apples, pears, oak, malt, corn.

F:  Dry, astringent, burnt pepper and oak.

This has a very atypical bourbon taste profile.  This bourbon has garnered quite a few negative reviews and comments.  I knew that before I purchased a bottle, but it didn’t stop me.  

It is fruity and somewhat dry. It’s hard to believe that this is 5 years old.  It seems a little light in color considering it’s 5+ years old and bottled at 100 proof.  I would have expected it to pick up more barrel notes, but this profile is definitely grain driven.  I don’t know if they aged it low in the rickhouse, or not much stave penetration took place, or what, but something is amiss here.  If you have ever smelled the “heads” cut of a distillate (the compounds that come off the still before the etOH), you would recognize it in this.  Nothing is really “good” about this bourbon, but the tannic/astringent burnt oak finish is the most off putting.  I haven’t had a bourbon like this in quite awhile.  I’m a fan of this company, mainly because they are pretty straightforward about giving you information about their products, and they have put out some decent sourced products (mainly Old Scout) in the past. I have no doubt they will put out better products in the future."
0.5,Simply awful. It’s smells and sadly tastes of clay or wet concrete. Avoid like the plague.
2.5,"Burn on the nose. Clove and spice, surprisingly bitter for a wheated bourbon."
