4.0,"The wine cask adds aromas of Maraschino cherries and tawny port to the nose. On the palate, the light peat is complimented nicely by a long dry finish. This is my first Longrow Red and I much prefer it to the regular bottlings, which I find fine but unremarkable."

4.0,"Interesting. South African Malbec. Pepper, peat and hint of red wine. I didn't add water but maybe I should have to see if more flavor came out. Good dram definately a 4."

3.25,"I don't know much about wine so this is all about just the flavors I get on here.  

As with all the red's I've seen it adds a touch of color to the normal golden colors of longrow.  Lovely color, nice legs.  

Nose - I love that springbank BBQ peat notes.  There is a sweatness from the wine, but just that general sweat longrow notes are there.  The end of the nose dries out from the wine notes.  

Taste- sweat, overly sweat grape notes from the wine.  Finish is that spingbank bbq peat.  There's a vanilla cookie vanilla waffer finish.  

Not a lot to write here on this one for me.  It's a very well made whisky but I don't think the Malbec was a good wine choice here.  it gives off more of a weird sweetness than i prefer.  Still outstanding and I'd get a bottle if I could."
4.0,My 1st Longrow Red. It’s a solid peated whisky with an interesting red wine finish that gives it dark fruit notes along with well-done maple bacon. The development is complex and varied and the finish long lasting. I’d buy another bottle.
5.0,Had the last drop of the bottle. One of the best Whisky i ever had.
