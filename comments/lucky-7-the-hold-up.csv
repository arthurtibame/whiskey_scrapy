4.0,Great tasting bourbon smooth it reminds me of Jefferson's presidential
3.75,"Appearance-  Dark Amber, many thin slower running legs.  Clings to glass in a nice thicker coating.

Taste-  2.oz neat in glen cairn and then 2 drops of water.

Nose-  Banana and raisin hit you immediately followed by plum, molasses, and oak.  Nice, fragrant, nose

Palate-  Layers of orchard fruits-  (perhaps ripe red apple?), chewy caramel, burnt brown sugar, and raisins. There are also some floral characteristics in the background that are opened up with water.

Finish:  Banana and browned butter are prominent followed by baking spices and some dry oaky heat.  Warming and long, perhaps a bit too hot and dry neat, but the addition of a couple drops smoothed it out enough to cover that flaw.

Overall-  At first I was hesitant given the price and the marketing-  strange emphasis on the golden age of Hollywood, and the ""Lucky Stage 7"" at Warner Bros.  I was fearing this to be some hyped, gimmicky bottle tie in like the Star Trek produced by Silverscreeen bottling Company, or the Terry Bradshaw bottle that recently came out.   I can truly say that it isn't.  This is a really nice bottle of Kentucky Straight Bourbon with 12 yrs of age on it, batched nicely.  This is rumored to be from Barton (1792 and many other good ones!) but the labeling says ""Distilled and Bottled at Lucky 7 Spirits, Bardstown KY"".  I doubt very much they have actually been distilling their own and then aging it for 12 years, and the distinct banana nose and notes throughout make me think that the Barton rumors are more true.  There is a 6 year version out for about 1/3rd the price.  The strength is in the many layers of flavor and really nice nose.  The weakness may be an overly hot and dry finish for 100 proof.  Overall I wouldn't shun this one.  It is a pleasant surprise."
