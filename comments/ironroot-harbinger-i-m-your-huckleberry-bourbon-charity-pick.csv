4.5,"So a few months ago I was given the opportunity to meet with the owners and master distiller by one of the members of the Arizona Whiskey Community. I have long been a supporter of IronRoot (as any of you who follow will know) so I was very excited at the prospect. Upon arrival at the Distillery and chatting with Jonathon and Robert we quickly moved to the aging warehouse were I proceeded to taste 15 barrels or so. The range of what they distill is incredible! At the end of the tasting adventure Jonathon (Master Distiller) tells me he will bottle anything I want straight from the barrel. I chose a 3 year old 100% Oaxacan Green Corn Mashbill aged in a #1 char and heavy toast barrel. Having a Bourbon created from such a unique heirloom corn created a wonderful profile. I took the bottle home to Arizona and shared it with my friend and founder of the Bourbon Charity. After a dram or two I suggested that we take this barrel and use it to raise money for Charity. Things progressed quickly and culminated in a 24 hr sell out of the barrel. Each bottle was priced at $59.99 with $20/bottle going to charity! Amazing! Now that you have the background let's dive into the tasting:

Upon entry you are hit with a big punch of toffee popcorn, butterscotch and candy corn. Mid palate adds toasted oak and wood spice with a satisfying jalapeno cornbread finish. 

Lovely dram that defies it's age! 

Cheers all and stay safe in these uncertain times!"
