2.75,"As workhorse of the blend industry, Tomintoul is one of the lesser-known Speyside distilleries. The nose of this 10-year-old expression is simple, muted and primarily fruity. Grapes, banana and hints of refined sugar intermingle with distant floral notes. Tasting thin, fragile and almost watery, this dram behaves like a Blended Scotch. Mildly bitter spices, fudge and grainy citrus give way to a modest, nutty and refill cask-dominated finish that is still the best part of the experience. Not quite sure what to make of it. Was this whisky meant to be sold as a Single Malt?

3.0,"Nose: Lemongrass, chamomile tea, some honey and touch of fresh briny breeze. As it rests and opens in the glass the clean, light aromas are joined by a warmer caramelised barley presence and a hint of baked banana. It's not a particularly complex nose, but it is crisp and refreshing. [The dry-glass aroma is the scent of meadow-flowers in spring].

Palate: Sweet and gentle cereal with flowery honey notes - leatherwood honey in particular - and a very slight hint of vanilla. Golden malt and sweet red apple in the development, plus some sweet-hay barnyard aromas. The texture is light but not watery. Don't add any water - it is a fragile malt and can't take dilution.

Finish: Medium/short. Crisp and nutty with a semi-sweet grassy aftertaste and a distant echo of licorice.

The nose is demure and takes a good 10-15 minutes to wake up, and even when it does it remains a subtle and elegant pleasure. Don't come to this whisky expecting to be bombarded with forceful aromas, that's not at all what it is about. This is a gentle, laid-back whisky to enjoy neat with friends on a warm day.

The palate is soothing and primarily cereal/grassy in nature, but it's not herbal. The top-notes are instead floral and sweet, like a fine honey the bees have crafted from meadow flowers or eucalyptus blossoms. It has a limited range but again that is intentional - just don't expect this to have intensity.

As for the finish, I disagree with the official tasting note that the finish is simply drying. It's demi-sec and strongly reminiscent of a young and slightly oaked white wine.

The soothing and gentle quality of this whisky can't be overstated. It's a combination of sweet herbal, honeyed and floral elements that works very well. I enjoyed it more than I had anticipated and it is good value for money. I'd certainly add it to the list of recommended first single malts for the novice.  Hmm, maybe I should make just such a list here on Distiller.

Tasted from a 30ml sample.

2.0,"Ah, Tomintoul- the gentle dram...

That’s their tagline.  I purchased a 3 5cl sampler pack with a European order a couple months ago figuring I’d give these guys another try after being very unimpressed with their Peaty Tang bottling.  This sampler has pours of the 10, 16 and 25 year old, unpeated malts for around $32 + shipping.  Not bad for a quarter century sample, I guess.  Let’s start with the 10 year and get a baseline first, shall we?

Upon pouring it into the Glencairn I get lots of warning signs:  golden yellow that looks like it was colored, big droplets of water and thin legs after giving it a spin, and even large water spots where the legs drained after things settle out.  Yikes, should I even question the advertised 40% ABV?  There’s a lot of water here.

The nose was non-existent during the pour and even after a solid 5 minutes of swirling there isn’t much wafting out of the glass.  What does appear, eventually, is weak bread notes, candied corn and a bit of fresh cut oak.  The key descriptor here though is “weak”.

The palate has a nice start with some sweet vanilla and oak, but then that cream corn note creeps in and just leaves a bland, corn chip flavor lingering on the tongue.  It’s a gentle dram and for a minute I swore it actually tasted like I was drinking room temperature water.  Yowza, Tomintoul- the TOO gentle dram...

The finish ended up being dry with a surprisingly high amount of bitterness and oak.  Thankfully it was short.

Overall, this is a dud.  I’m hoping the 16 and 25 year old samples will offer something more along the lines of depth and character.  If it’s just a couple of well aged water and corn it will be $32 wasted.  This thing is a 2 star dram just because it has alcohol in it.  I see no reason to buy a full bottle for any reason, though.  Unless you like soft, corn-flavored water.  Cheers, my friends."

2.0,"On the nose I find it to be quite sharp and spirity with sour green apples, leafy green vegetation, dusty white pepper and a touch of honeyed cereal.
-
To the palate it is spiky and sweet with that tart green apple coming though with a hint of light pepper and very light honey.  A vanilla fudge note appears towards the end with a chai spice assortment with a hint of oak or tea tannin.
-
The finish lingers with a bit of that spirity roughness I caught early on.  There may be a hint of nuttiness hiding in the gently honeyed finish."

4.5,"The nose has light and playful scents of dried berries, fallen leaves, a touch of orange peel and oats. 

There is a slight yeasty component, kind of like walking into a bakery in the morning when the ovens are still warming up.

The taste is smooth and silky, containing flavors of toasted almonds, sunflower seeds, dried apple and figs. There is a subtle touch allspice and french cookies in the finish. For lack of a better description, I would compare the taste to a really good trail mix."
