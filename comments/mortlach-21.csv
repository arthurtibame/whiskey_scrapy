3.0,"A fine whisky, but I couldn't taste 21 years of maturation. It would seem the casks were pretty inactive."

3.0,"I can appreciate this for being a scotch with interest but this is not what I am accustomed to from Speysides or scotches in this age range for that matter. There are very little notes to express but you can note the smoke through the whole experience, other than that it is simply a salty sherry palate. If you get a chance to taste it you should but I wouldn't purchase this bottle."

3.0,Not getting a lot out of this one. Not one of the best ones I've had...slightly spirit forward. Few drops of water helped open up a bit
