4.5,"Bowmore 5 Year Old - Douglas Laing Old Particular Single Cask for K&L Wines - 61% ABV
⠀
Nose: Meaty, like a nice smoked salt-crusted pork roast. Cashews. Stir fried green beans. Barley sugars and grilled pineapple. A nice salty peat like Talisker. A little bit of cheesy sulfur. Not hot, but some ethanol. The emptied glass smells like wonderful candied bacon.
⠀
Taste: Delicious salty and ashy peat, peanuts, juicy tropical fruit, pepper, caramelized sugar, certainly some heat.

The texture is somewhat soft and oily. The high proof numbs the tongue a bit over time. The finish is a smoky sour sweetness and lasts for a solid minute. Overall, very impressed with this Bowmore and will certainly be looking out for their delicious whisky in the future! They have a reputation for some incredible old whisky, so hopefully I'll get to try some eventually.
