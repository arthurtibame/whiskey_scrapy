5.0,Every smell and taste combines to give a great experience in your mouth.
3.25,"Ah, muted but familiar rye nose, slightly herbal, MGP. Black tea and Pepsi on the palate, then a burst of dill that lingers. Smooth for the proof. Ends with charred wood and bitterness. Great on profile bottling. 9/2/19"
