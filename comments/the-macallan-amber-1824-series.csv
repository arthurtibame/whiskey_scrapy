3.0,"On the nose, very sweet and fruity, with notes of sherry and orange, with a light grainy background, something like barley. On the mouth, light to medium body, oily, sweet, just a little bit spicy. The finish is medium to long, but a little bit messy."

3.75,"Third in a chromatic series, Amber presents itself strictly without added colouring (they say) and a nice light gold (no, not amber).
The nose is sweet and marmalade-ysh. Vanilla, candied fruit, raisins... a bit like approaching a cake, with a warm and delicate aroma. Not cloying, but a good pimp.
The palate can only resume what is perceived by the nose, with still a lot of vanilla, candied orange, butter... from the jam to pastries, with a pinch of wood and spices that peep out. Very soft and smooth, without flicker but pleasant.
The finish is not very long, less sweet and more spicy, but always creamy."

3.0,"The combination of European and American x-sherry casks gives a sweet aroma of mostly vanilla mixed with some cinnamon, white stone fruit and light floral notes. There is no age statement and I think the lack of body reflects that is it is not a very mature whisky. The texture is dry and harsh with a hot finish (not my preferred smooth and oily feel). The palate loses some of the vanilla but retains the fruit and spice. The floral notes come through more and there is the addition of cereal grains. It's an enjoyable drink but at almost $100 AUD  it's definitely not the best value and I won't be buying it again unless it's about 20% off."

3.0,"Nose for me was fruity, with heady sugar notes. On the palate I was struck by the buttery feel which was quite pleasant, folllowed quickly by light caramel mixed with honey. There was a very faint grassy note which made for a light, pleasant flavor. It finished back with a strong honey note, just pushing the point where it could have become cloyingly sweet. I did taste a good amount of dried fruit, but not nearly as much as the expert taster here. This made for a good, smooth, summer whisky."

3.5,"Nose: Sultanas, oranges, sherry, vanilla, lemon oil, hints of pineapple, something spicy (maybe ground cinnamon?), old paper. Fairly fresh and fruity overall.

Palate: Pleasantly dry on the arrival and into the development, but no hint of bitterness or sourness at any stage. Sherry and fruit are the initial flavours. The development brings a sweeter note and suddenly a most unexpected wave of rich sherried fruit cake with sweet preserved  citrus peel, glacé cherries and almonds. Quite delicious. It's not a complex palate, just a few key flavour components, but they combine into a very pleasant whole. A good texture, if a little thin.

Finish: Quite short, turning sweet and more like bread and butter pudding, dried fruits, a little sour/bitter hint of grapefruit, which is quite nice, and a lingering touch of aniseed or fennel.

There is an unmistakable kinship between this and the Gold expression, but Amber is a definite step up.

Richer overall with the fruitiness being more sweet/tropical instead of bright and bracing. The cereal notes are deeper as well, being more like cake than biscuits. I think the basic distillate is probably the same but just given different wood treatment.  This is fairly cask-driven, but subtle about it.

It's just coming into summer here and the day is clear and warm - this whisky suits it perfectly. Tasted from a 30ml sampler - I may buy a bottle and it would sit on the shelf next to Arran Lochranza Reserve and Compass Box Asyla.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

3.0,"1L. Matured in sherry casks this offers fuller flavour than the Gold while being more delicate than the Sienna. Unsurprisingly it is amber in colour and fragrant with aromas of citrus, orange peel, spice, peat and smoke; the palate is complex with smoke, ginger, dried fruits, apricots and cinnamon that lingers on a long finish.
COLOUR

Amber

NOSE

Polite, almost apologetic at first, with a floral, citrus sweet nose that gains presence, commanding a chorus of vanilla notes over freshly harvested grain. Raisin, sultana and cinnamon look on as toffee apples and candy floss step into the limelight.

PALATE

Fresh green apples and lemons mingle with cinnamon. Ginger notes hover as fruit takes over, with subtle oak lingering in the wings.

FINISH

Light to medium with soft fruits and cereal, slightly dry."

3.75,"Ding, ding. The bell sounds for the WWWC (whisky welterweight championship) title. In the left corner  we have the maple leaf champ Canadian club 20 year and in the right Scotlands finest - Macallan Amber. Whatya say Jim Murray whose gunna take it? Canadian Club you reckon? Hmm with JMs track reckon its not looking good for the Canuk if he's getting paid to promote...i mean honestly is giving his opinion. But as we know the ref is severely biased against all things Macallan.. Its a tough one. Macallan comes out smooth and strong. Left -  candied oranges, vanilla - and then the right - toffee, caramel...not a devastatingly complex combo but it's more than enough for CCs weak kneed insipid sweetness. MA goes the round but CC gets dragged out of the ring and dumped unceremoniously down the sink by the waitress. The ref for once is impressed given Macallans share of the fight purse actually matches his ability this time round at $70 a bottle. 3.5 - 3.75 rounding to a 4 for the three initials usually never associated with the word Macallan...VFM. Sadly once his promoter hears those three letters he drops MA like a hot potato as he doesn't want to devalue his brand..."

I find it gently coating and pleasant, some cinnamon or spice near the end. The finish is medium; Oak seems older almost musty. A little bitter for the first while too and somewhat drying. Overall this is an OK and gentle Scotch. I think what you paid for it might have a great impact on how much you like it. For me, it was a gift and I can enjoy it. However, I'm not sure it's worth the prices I have seen being asked."

I once did it with a Romeo&Juiliet cigar, they both in the palate do pair nicely, but the cigar taste quickly overwhelms the Macallan's taste. Anyways still a very good whisky, just it doesn't have that more prolonged ending like the more aged Macallans."
