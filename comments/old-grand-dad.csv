3.0,"Great personal bottom shelf whiskey that I prefer over other major brands for its taste. It's got some heat if you're going neat, but a more advanced flavor profile than white/black Beams, etc. It's price per taste value at such a low price point is hard to beat. Def give it a try!"

4.0,This is a solid introductory bourbon for all types as well as a crowd-pleasing budget-friendly bottle for gatherings. Good for cocktails. A little spice livens up a solid amount of sweetness that ends quickly and cleanly. The least astringent of all the Olds.

3.0,OG is my basic bourbon when I want something cheap. Beats anything else on the bottom shelf and gives pricier bourbons a run for their money.
2.0,"Has a decent rye presence and little else. Short finish, not much body or complexity. Hurt by the lower proof. The bonded 100 proof version is probably much better. Jim Beam Black is cheaper in my region, and it's also a far better whiskey, so it's a no-brainer for me."

3.0,"This is a great value whiskey. The nose is very mild, a faint honey spice smell. For the taste, it it tastes of a minty oak mixed with a bit of apple and green, pre-ripe fruit. It is a tad watery for a rye, and the aftertaste is short with just the trace of oak. But for under 20 bucks, you could do a whole lot worse."

nose: vanilla, banana, some spice, light cherry, sweat, liggt sandalwood
taste: oaky, cherry, cloves, anise, and orange peel. 
finish: watery popsicle stick, not long. some pepper, forgettable. 
final: a bit dilute at 40%, bonded version is far better. good value for a high rye lovers, good to keep around to introduce people to bourbon. prefer beam or evan willams BIB for at this pricepoint."

Great to throw in a flask, and at $22 per bottle, there is much reason to pick one up. Not great, not memorable, but it's a solid value. 2.5 stars."

3.0,"The last time I had this bourbon was decades ago, gas was $.28 a gallon. I had just gotten my first decent job making pretty good money ($102.50 per week) and felt I had graduated from the cheap bottom shelf offerings to Makers Mark, Harpers, Wellers and the like. Too bad I forgot there are some hidden jewels down there and this is one. 

The nose is a little timid but you’ll detect orange peel, cinnamon and woods. The body is a little thin but I picked up mostly an oily pine mouth feel which was very pleasant with more orange peel and hints of cinnamon, relatively short finish with the oily pine coating remaining. Although they say this is a high rye mash bill it doesn’t resonate as strongly as I would like.

While this can’t compare with the mid shelf offerings it can hold its own on the bottom shelf. I found this very approachable and friendly and a welcome reminder not to take Old Grand-dad for granted."
2.75,"Honestly if tasting this and basil Hayden’s blind I hardly tell a difference and at 12.99-14.99 a 750 I always choose this!
Yeah maybe the basil Hayden’s is “aged longer” however I’m yet to believe it since basil isn’t age stated and in blind tastings the two haven’t been picked apart correctly more than half the time.
What can I say it’s 80 proof and I hold 80 proof stuff in low regard taste wise but this atleast has some flavor"

3.75,"One of my 4 favorite bottom shelf bourbons. Higher percentage of rye than most similarly priced bourbons. This is supposed to be based on Basil “Old Grand Dad” Hayden’s recipe. It may be true, but as good as this one is it is not “poor man’s” Basil Hayden’s."
3.25,"Finally trying the base OGD. The OGD114 is one of my favorite whiskies on the planet, but I find the Bonded just ""OK"". Let's see what I think of this one.
NOSE: Orange Peel, Cedar, Straw, Old Oak, and maybe a hint of a Floral note. The more time it spends in the glass, the more the Cedar note takes charge.
NEAT: Thin, muted delicate flavors. The Orange Peel from the nose. Vanilla, Cinnamon, Leather and Oak. Pleasantly Spicy. Not much of a Kentucky Hug but there is a pleasant finish with Orange and Oak coating. The more you sip the more the Oak accumulates on the palate, positively affecting subsequent sips. 
SPLASH: Gives and almost Maple note to the nose and the palate becomes pure Maple Syrup. Tames what little spiciness there is. A large cube of ice kills this one completely. Drink it neat, folks.
VERDICT: I like this. I hate I waited so long to try it. It would be a solid 3.75 from me but I feel it is overpriced (Just shy of $20 here, though it was on sale for $17) and does not stand up to ice and that is how I consume a lot of cheaper bourbons...glass in hand at the grill. I'd still say that if you were in the mood for an 80 proofer, you could do a lot worse."
3.0,Good cheap option for high rye lovers. The vanilla notes are great in an old fashioned. Nothing fancy. Just grandpa cough medicine.

2.0,"Appearance: When I look at this bourbon in my glass I see it as almost orange in color. With a little swirl or two I notice the legs, medium in thickness and watery.

Nose: The bouquet of the nose is great while it lasts. Notes of corn, apple peel, slight sea salt caramel, and faint smoke sits with me for a minute then the nose seems to just close off. It's odd and kinda disappointing.

Taste: The palate has notes of red apple, honey, and with an inhalation of air through the mouth after swallowing there's a briny almost scotch-like vibe. After a splash of water though most of that dissipates and a cherry note takes its place.
Finish: There is a short finish with a little heat before adding water.

Thoughts: So, as a disclaimer, I got the 43% ABV version, apparently they’re transitioning into a lower 40% ABV version. That said, I think it's good, but not impressive. It's probably a bourbon your old grand-dad would be content with, but I would suggest you and him trying other things. I would actually love to try Old Grand-Dad Bonded and see how the extra age and proof help it out. Thanks to you and all in your family tree, Beam! Cheers!"

2.75,"If Evan black had a cooler older cousin who wasnt nearly as well known.

Menthol. Boiled peanuts. Pipe tobacco. This thing makes you ready for a big Kentucky hug as soon as it gets near your lips.

@bdanner is spot-on noting how the cedar/wood hints become more forward after it sits in the glass. Its nice.

Stephanie, who I might add writes my favorite reviews on distiller, gets it dead-on with flat coke. It's not a big, punchy bourbon with body and finish but sometimes I just want to breeze through (delicious) shots, y'know?

The end of the mouth is the definition of leathery, charcoal soot, rye mashbill character. It's good, it's cheap, it's not bland nor forgettable. 

Buy some!
82/100 for just taste, maybe bump it a good solid few points for value."

On the palate, more of the same, vanilla, clove and caramel toffee. Finish medium with clove. It is suppossed to be somehow a special bottle because the one i drank was very old, maybe from the 80s.

3.5,"The first thing that hits my nose is bananas, bananas, bananas.  The initial mouthfeel is a bit oily with a hit of oak on a short finish.  Not much else on the first run.

Coming back a few minutes later for a second pass, I'm picking up more classic bourbon aromas of caramel & butterscotch but they're somewhat muted.  The bananas are still there but deeper into the background.  The oily mouthfeel is much more present now and some bitterness is coming through.

Pass three includes the addition of a small amount of water.  The water helped bring the bananas to the front again and I'm also getting some subtle spices like cloves & cinnamon.  It also pushed the oak flavor up front and there is actually a hit of warmth on what feels like a longer finish.

The last short nose and sip were pretty much the same as the previous pass.

Although I'm not the most experienced whiskey taster or reviewer, I feel this falls into about the 3.5 stars range.  I do like the banana aromas but there isn't very much going on flavor wise for me.  That having been said, it is pretty good considering the $13.49 price for a 750ml bottle.  I'm looking forward to tasting this again down the line."

2.75,"Went to NH liquor store for Evan Williams BIB. They didn't have it at Franklin store so I grabbed this instead. I really enjoy the 114 but this is a different animal. Neat it noses rye spice , caramel and seasoned wood. Its light and on the surface. Palate carries a zesty caramel rye with more barrel notes albeit watered down a bit. Finishes with trailing rye and wood drying out. Its a decent 80proofer but nothing special. If you enjoy the profile upgrade to the BIB or 114 for sure. Otherwise just find Evan Williams White Label and get a far superior bourbon for less $$.............78/100"
