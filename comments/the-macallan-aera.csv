2.0,"Oh my god this was a bad whisky. A expensive (250$) beautiful bottle, Macallan Aera Royal Black is a expression that only came out for the taiwan travel exclusive market, in order for Macallan to enter that country with strength...  i dont think they have accomplished it. I am not a fond fan of Macallan but i did not expect it to be so bad. I organized a tasting event and this was the main attraction... and it dissapointed everyone. 

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, it WAS AMAZING. and that is how it scored the only 2 stars it has. White Kit Kat chocolate, pineapple, grapefruit, Lime, old pineapple slices, sawdust. 

On the palate, it was not good. There is some very dim almonds and white chocolate somewhere there but it is mostly WATER AND LETTUCE. Have you ever found Lettuce notes in your whisky? Well they are just bad. 

There is no aftertaste. Note one note. Is like drinking water. ZERO POINTS. Not one note. 

Overall this is terrible. If it weren't for the nose, this whisky could even have a lower score. I was in a tasting event, so 20 people agree on this. Luckily we had another 3 drams, and that saved the night. This is one of the worst whiskies i have ever had, avoid it, dont waste your money. 43 over 100 (scoring notes: nose 23, palate 10, finish 0, balance 10)."
