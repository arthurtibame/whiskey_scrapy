3.5,"Not a bad Canadian whisk(e)y.  Most Canadian whiskeys, especially blended, are extremely smooth with sweet notes and some wood (think ""sweet"" maple vs smoky oaky notes... aligned with what Canadians like), but rather light on flavor than robust American bourbons/whiskeys. 

Kirkland's maintains the smoothness and sweet notes, but you do get more wood (at least for my palate) in the finish, probably from the aging in oak casks. There is still that hint of maple notes as well. Works well as a mixer, but still good neat or on the rocks when you don't want something heavy.

Note: Some folks think this comes from the same distilleries that make Crown Royal (a Diageo company). But at least with the recent bottles, that can't be the case. If you look on the bottle, it comes from ""Wide World Importers, Louisville, KY"" which is an alternative business name for Buffalo Trace/Sazerac.  So it CAN'T be from the same place as Crown Royal since Diageo and Sazerac are competitors."
