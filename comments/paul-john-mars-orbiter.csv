4.5,I really enjoy this whisky. Aroma is warm and rich with a grapey-syrupy-meets-vanilla-taffy note that emerges as it opens; Palate Is almost two tones of smoke and grapey dark fruit sweetness with all the other notes sandwiched in between; Finish hits a long elegant stride and keeps the sweet and smoky party going.
5.0,"Drammers Club pour. This was a 4.5 year old vatting from 3 bourbon barrels to honor India Mars orbit mission which has lasted longer than the expected 6 months and is still going on. This one is very tangy and has notes of Peat, Chocolate, Toffee, Guava, Passion Fruit, Citrus, Pineapple, Treacle, Pepper, Butterscotch, Orange, and Caramel"
