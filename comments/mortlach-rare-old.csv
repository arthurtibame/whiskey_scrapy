4.0,"Faint peanut brittle and deep spirit on the nose.  Smooth dram.  Lots of oak and tobacco on the pallet and milk chocolate sweetness with a splash of sea water.    Finishes on the same tasting notes. I didn't get much spice, like some other reviews noted, but I prefer my whiskeys to be low on spice factor."

4.0,A good buy for $60 on sale.  Original price seems outrageous.

2.0,"Mortlach is known for its meaty flavor profile but you would never know that by tasting this NAS expression.  There are muted sherry notes on the nose and palate.  I can't help but feel that the component sherry casks could have used a few more years in order to impart a more robust and full flavor.  This scotch is slightly redeemed by its spicy finish that evokes cracked black pepper.  I get the sense they were going for a sweet-and-savory experience but I wish they went for more bold flavors.  After all, isn't this supposed to be the ""Beast of Dufftown?"""

2.0,"Sharp spirit taste, nice aroma."
3.0,"This is the Mortlach for the patient. Singly so, it's spicy. There's an undercurrent of that Mortlach Christmas mince, but this one was a bit heavy handed on the spice. Strangely, as it airs, it mellows out and settles into a fine peppery fruit. Long finish."

4.0,"Wawawiwa, as Borat would say. This is good whisky, and only deserves Distiller's 80 rating if you're nasally congested. How else am I to explain such a low score? The nose screams sherry, with notes of sultana raisins and crisp lemons. The body carries well at 43.4% ABV, with more sweet notes of raisins and cinnamon. The finish is medium in length, with appropriate spiciness . I like it plenty."

null,"On the nose...medium spice, cherries, sandalwood, leather 

On the palate...watery, flavours take a few seconds to develop and there is spice, a light leathery note, sandalwood and medium bitter from the oak also a grassy taste comes through. It tastes like a mix of young and some aged scotch.  So so, 2.5/5"

4.25,"I am actually surprised to see so many negative comments. I agree the price tag is a bit high, but I think it lives up to the expectation of a slightly more pricey Mortlach.

The nose is delicate with apples, nuts and caramel. On palate it is elegant - very smooth with apples and apricots, followed by some toasted marshmallows and cinnamon. The finish is lingering honey with toasty notes. 

I am happy to have this bottle on my shelf and it is a great drink to accompany a book or a classic movie."

3.5,"Spicy apples and pears on the nose, same on the palate with a little honey, finish is consistent with the palate, long and, I think, the best part of this whisky."
3.0,"Smakt på Bonnegolt. God, men lite ettersmak"
3.5,"Yeah I'm with @cascode on this one. A bit ethanolly although it improves with time. Honey, nutmeg, sulphur and rubber. Typical mortlach. Not the best one I've had but I still like it. 3.5. Oh and cascode is also right about the Mortlach G&M 15. Out of 6 its the highest rated one I've had. And cheapest as well at around $80 USD."
3.0,"very spicy. oily, medium body. sweet but not to much. VFM"
3.0,"Nose: Fresh and brisk, leather, light fruit, thin honey, some sherry and a touch of vanilla with an earthy weight. Some red berries and a hint of sandalwood. Overall it's a cereal-driven nose but there is an unwelcome spirity quality (this improves greatly with time and water, see below).

Palate: Smooth, sweet arrival. Malty and cereal and some soft warm spices. Stewed fruits, but very mild, with vanilla. The texture is agreeably silky but not creamy or oily - in fact it's on the thin side. A little bit of oak spice peeks through, but it's very shy, and there is a touch of a metallic quality.

Finish: Short. Sweet and a little fruity (thin orange marmalade?), but again rather ethanol/watery in the finale.

This may be the Beast of Dufftown, but in this expression the monster has been whipped into submission and chained in its cage. The nose has some good features but is marred by an ethanol quality that gives it a character more like that of a blended scotch than a single malt. Thankfully, this mostly blows off after a while resting in the glass, and the addition of a couple of drops of water transmutes it further into a fragrant note, almost like eau de cologne.

On the palate this whisky has a very smooth entry, but it seemed to me to lack heft . You would never guess that it is 43.4% abv (it seems more like 37%!). Once again, the addition of a dash of water brings improvement, as more spiciness (almost bitterness) comes out and the palate broadens. However it never gains that familiar Mortlach meatiness.  In this expression it's more like shaved luncheon ham than hunter's stew.

This expression confirms my opinion that Mortlach is best in independent bottlings. Ignore this one and instead buy the Gordon & MacPhail 15 year or the lovely Maltman 22 year.

This is not bad whisky as such, but knowing what this distillery can do it's a relative disappointment.  It's better than merely average, but in the same manner as a good blend.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
