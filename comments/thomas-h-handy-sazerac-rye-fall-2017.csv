4.0,"Smell is sweet caramel/vanilla and oak...with almost no hints of heat.  Taste after coating the tongue is very drying and spicy, complex, finish is long with a long linger of spice ... plenty of heat but i don’t get that warm chest feeling that i get from GTS"

5.0,"THH is my favorite rye of 2017. It’s got heat, spice, and everything nice. Once the initial youthful heat dissipates, you get huge orange and honey flavors, balanced by cinnamon and pepper spice. Basically liquid candy with a kick. Highly recommended."

The oak has transformed into some sort of spicy hot berries over the years. Delightful."

4.0,"Neat, the nose is almost imperceptible. Add a drop or two of water, and things improve. There is a lot of heat, spice, and oak, but the flavors don't linger like Stagg. I prefer the Willett 4 year if I'm going for rye, especially considering the price of entry."

4.5,Fruity with the spicy rye - legit
4.0,"Good nose, fresh linens and light wood. Smells like Spring. Initially muted on the tongue, seems milder than other years. Notes of fruit, nuts, cola. Don't worry, eventually the spice starts to creep up. Ends with cacao nibs. Delicious as usual. 2/22/17"
4.5,"The nose is oaky and creamy with toasted rye, vanilla and toffee. The palate is rich and dry and fills the mouth with a sweet and spicy rye balanced perfectly with toffee, while vanilla lingers in the background. The finish is medium long with rye spiciness that lingers for a while with toffee that keeps things balanced and sweet. Not a complicated whiskey, but everything it has it does exceptional."
4.25,"Orangey-copper in color.
Sweet butter, citrus, light wood and brown sugar on the nose.
Sweet citrus oil and musty oak on the palate.
It’s definitely hot, even after multiple drops of water...but not overwhelmingly so."

4.75,Like a reunion with a long lost friend!!! Quintessential nose of a rye without being over powering. A sweet fruit and floral nose. Smooth taste that belies the high proof.  Nice rye pop and slight smoke. Great peppery finish like a fine peppercorn steak sauce. So good!!!

4.5,"Cherries and toffee on the nose, notes of orange, nutmeg, spices, and toffee on the pallet, sweet toffee with some char on a lingering finish. Best rye I’ve had so far"
4.5,"Nose: Vanilla, Apricot, quite a bit of oak, a hint of peppermint and some dusty corn notes as well.

Flavor: Spicy with quite a bit of apricot and still more background mint.

Finish: Oaky and fruity with hot cinnamon and clove notes.  Medium long with lingering spices and more stone fruit.

Wow this is good!  Not super complex but the fruity spicy flavor is outstanding!"
0.0,Little bite
4.5,"Nose- Gingerbread, baking spices, orange zest, caramel, molasses, dill, cinnamon, and a bit of lemon

Palate- Spices (black pepper, cardamom, clove and cinnamon), peach, cherry, rosemary, caramel

Finish- Incredibly long, drying finish with herbal rosemary notes accompanied by ginger and bright citrus

At first sip this slaps you across the face. Powerful and dry. Has a long, dry finish that you can feel from the throat down to the stomach. Nose is not too hot, with a surprisingly fruity profile, along with normal rye spices with an interesting lemon note. Palate is complex and tasty. Oak is present throughout, along with all the rye and baking spices you could ask for. Some notes of peach and cherry are present as well. This is a fantastic rye."

4.0,Smooth for the proof. Cherries early. Toffee for sure late. Oaky in the nose. Worth trying once but I’m not paying 30+ per pout again
