3.0,"Soft nose, with mint, and after a few minutes, some maple syrup. On the palate, leather and spice, and surprising herbal rye notes. Pleasant sweet undertones, and lingering tannins and bitterness. Another good sipper in this series. 10/28/18"

Seeing all these recent bourbon reviews I've decided to pop open one of the few special bourbons I have in my collection:  Jim Beam Signature Craft Triticale.  

One of six releases under their Harvest Bourbon Collection, this one uses the rye and wheat hybrid, triticale.  It has also been aged for 11 long years and comes in at 90 proof.

I have a small pour of regular Beam just to (hopefully) provide some obvious distillery similarities.  Right away, the triticale is deeper in color and the nose is much more involved.  There's a slight sweetness penetrating through the heavy oak spice.  On the tongue there's a nice vanilla and malt presence that gets drowned out quickly by oak and pepper spices.  It's incredibly smooth with a warm, rye-like biting finish.  It feels close to a good single malt scotch that has been aged in single use bourbon barrels.  I let it sit a little longer before finishing it and it explodes with even more vanilla sweetness.  Great, especially for a Jim Beam product.

All that said, price point is beyond ridiculous at $50.  That's insane for Jim Beam and to make matters worse- this bottle is only 375ml (around 13oz).  Yikes!  I can't recommend it at that price, although it is interesting enough that I'm glad I was able to try it.  Seek out a friend willing to share instead of buying it yourself.  Cheers."
