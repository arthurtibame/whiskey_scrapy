Drinking over ice with dinner is quite a departure from my typical tasting sessions, but it drinks like a cocktail with a perfect amount of sweetness and bourbon flavor. Honestly blown away...it’s no JD Tennessee Honey that’s for sure!"

1.5,"My first job out of college was at a big pharma.  I was in their R&D rotation program, where we spent 6 months rotating around various facilities.  My first six months:  I got up every morning, dressed in head to toe overalls and a face mask, and went into a monkey house.  Not a monkey house as a place where they joke around.  A real monkey house, with rhesus monkeys in cages.  While my lab partner held a monkey, wrestling him to prevent it from tearing our eye sockets out, I had to fondle his private parts to make him urinate in a test tube.  Times like those you seriously start thinking which f**ked up life choice you made to get you in that position.  Where did you take that left turn when you should’ve taken a right?  Having a pour of this tonight, I ask a similar question.  What the hell possessed me to buy a bottle of this?  Not a pour.  Not a sip.  But a while f**king bottle.  Was it because it’s available in Colorado only, and I figured I need to bring back a souvenir from my recent Denver trip? Maybe it was the lure of thinking “ hey, I like honey, so I’m damn f**king sure I’ll like this”.  Either way, it was a fallacy in a serious life choice decision making that led me into trying something that smells like a sugared covered plastic, and taste like a gym sock dipped in honey."
