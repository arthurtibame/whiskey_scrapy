0.25,"God awful flavor.  I bought it because I thought the fox on the bottle was neat.  I took a big whiff of the bottle when I opened it.  There is a slight gym sock smell to it.  When I took a swig at room temperature (no ice, no adulteration) the flavor on the tongue was terrible and the aftertaste worse. 

Cool bottle.  Cool classic ""cowboy"" looking bottle, but awful flavor."
