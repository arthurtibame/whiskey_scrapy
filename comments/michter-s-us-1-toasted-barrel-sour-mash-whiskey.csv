3.75,Low proof makes it easy to drink. Quiet hint of smoke from the toasted barrels. Kind of sweet. Pepper finish.

4.75,Really tasty. The toasted barrel does so much for this.
4.5,"Nose: Carmel and spice dominate the nose

Taste: smoky smores taste

Finish: vanilla finish"

4.75,So gud
4.5,"Big caramel, big oak, cherry, creamy/oily, long finish"
4.25,"Nose: light caramel and marshmallow. Sweeeet smells
Palate: super sweet and spicy at the same time. Reminds me of the toasted bourbon but it has some spice of course. Syrupy, sweetness. Creamy like ice cream. 
Finish: heavy caramel finish that’s medium/long"
4.75,Toasted caramel bomb is what I tasted. I highly recommend this one.

4.0,Definitely superior to the normal sour mash product. Turns it into a well rounded whiskey and brings a subtle sweetness to it.

2.0,Cherry flavored marshmallow and wood tannins. This lost all the body of the standard Sour Mash and it has no body. Very disappointing.

4.0,"Taste:  Neat 1.5 oz in glen cairn

Nose (3.25): Sweet corn and bbq sauce dominate.  It is a pleasing nose but the sweet corn aroma suggests this to be young.  Makes me skeptical that this might be one that wash rushed to market and needs more barrel time.  I hoped that it would not further fall apart.

Palate (4.25)  Where I felt the nose was young, I felt the palate the tale of two cities!  Super interesting.  It is the best of sourmash (sweet yellow butterscotchy candies from grandma's candy bowl) and toasted finishing (campfire marshmallows, smokey embers).  Where I wasn't bowled over by the nose, the palate made me want it more.

Finish (3.75)  I get a pleasant bbq sauce and s'mores sans chocolate.  Wish it were longer but this was really good while it lasted.

Overall:  Showcased the best of both worlds-  sweet, corny, butterscotchy sourmash and that campfire toastiness with a woody smokehouse flavor on the back end.  This is one I would absolutely LOVE to taste at a barrel proof.  It is intriguing but is not the best balance.  I like it better than toasted bourbon, but not as sophisticated as toasted rye in 2017"

3.5,Great depth for proof.
4.25,"I like this quite a bit. It has more spice and layers than the 2018 Toasted Barrel Bourbon   (Which I quite liked) and is about on par with the Barrel Strength Rye. All in all, a very good offering. I got this for $68 and it’s definitely worth it at that price. I probably wouldn’t buy it at the $100+ price that many retailers are asking for it (and I’m sure the secondary market will be ridiculous!). So if you are a Michter’s fan and can find it close to MSRP, buy it!"

4.25,2019. I like the lower proof. Toasted Barrel process adds a nice estery fruity note. Very enjoyable limited release.

4.0,"Earlier today I have the great fortune of running into one of these bad boys at a local big box store! They rarely ever get allocated Whiskey but when they do it tends to sit hence why I make a point of stopping by weekly!

As for the whiskey itself it definitely lived up to my personal expectations given the price paid ($64.99 using a $10 off $50 coupon). Let's dive into the review:

Enters pretty rich and mouth coating especially considering the low proof (86)! Initial notes are rich butterscotch and vanilla leading into the toasted oak and a sprinkle of black pepper. Hints of chocolate and orange peel as well. Finish is a decent length a tad drying with more oak, oak spice, toffee and vanilla. Really a lovely pour. Definitely on the sweeter side but in a really pleasant way. I personally prefer this to the Bourbon Toasted Finish and have not had the Rye. 

Cheers All!"

4.5,"I am happy to have tried this early on in a night of drinking, because this is a great pour but it is ultimately light and nuanced and I suspect I appreciated it more on a fresh palate than I would have after my senses became more dulled.

Marshmallow sweetness with a touch of brown sugar and almond cookie.  Reminds me a bit of vanilla custard.  Really enjoyed this."

3.75,Higher proof would have made it a lot better. I found it to be overall weak and short lasting. Kinda disappointed

3.25,"Smells fruity and spicy, with a surprising musty, young note. Fragrant. A hint of maple syrup. On the palate, a young note at first, some turpentine, then cider like sweetness and tartness, with a nice spice that lingers. Sharp, almost a bit of astringent balsa wood that I get with some whiskeys. Seems like this will open up? 11/17/19"
4.0,Marshmallow. Toasted oak. Black Pepper. The flavor is great but the body is light and disappointing.
4.0,"The color is a rich brownish amber with any movement leaving heavy legs sticking to the sides of the glass. The nose is very gentle but full of oak, cooked caramel, vanilla, molasses and just a hint of floral rye notes. The oak carries over strongly to the palate with molasses balancing it out, as cooked caramel and vanilla play backup. The finish is medium and very oaky where you can really taste the toast as the rest of the palate fades, albeit a bit too quick. Simple but flavorful, if the finish somewhat let’s down the experience."

3.75,Nose is sweet spicy cinnamon. Taste is sweet caramel up front with a spicy finish. It’s pretty thin to me. It’s good but not something I would pay over retail for.
3.75,Surprisingly light. Their small batch bourbon with more flavor. Mild astringent taste. A good pour but not quite what I expected.

3.75,"You've managed to get away from the metropolitan areas filled with zombies, but it's still too risky to light a campfire at night. Just pour a glass of this, and it will satiate your want for the campfire.

Smells smokey from that charred barrel.
Tastes like smokey smores. 

Get a bottle for your zombiepocalypse bag. You won't regret it."

3.75,"Nose reminds me of cold mornings of my childhood, tearing open the Quaker Oats Instant Oatmeal packet of maple and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is gentle/light, but plenty of sweet cinnamon, raisins, quickly transitioning to black pepper/anise, fading slowly to a nice long dry oak finish. Just a hint of astringency on the finish is the only detractor. Proof hounds need not bother with this one. Probably not worth the secondary price, but a nice pour nonetheless."

3.5,"Pour at Radiator in Seattle ($25/1.5oz). Nose was thin and dominated by sweetness and ethanol. Some oak notes on the nose came in. The palate was thinner than I’d expect, in body and in flavor. Fruit, oak, vanilla. Very short finish. Just felt hollow and is overpriced at retail, let alone secondary."
