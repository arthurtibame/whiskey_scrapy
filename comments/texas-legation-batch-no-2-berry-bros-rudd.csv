0.25,Horrible
3.25,Fruity and vanilla on nose. Earthy and peppery. Not very complex. Different but ok.
3.5,"Vanilla and apricot on the nose, followed by peppery body with fresh peach and dry, short lasting finish."
4.0,"Like a few others here, day 1 of my advent calendar and I enjoyed this one. Smooth and fruity. Young. Not at all smoky. No caramel to note."
2.75,"Not bad, but tastes young. Sweet, but in a fruity, floral sense—not caramel and vanilla. Cinnamon and plenty of ethanol on the finish. Reminds me a lot of Clyde Mays."
2.0,"Young and needs more time in cask.  Fruity, but just not developed. Lots of fresh corn husk still on the nose and an alcohol bite."

3.5,Day 1 on Advent Calendar. Good with a bit of bite on initial sip. Smooths out nicely on subsequent sips. Excellent smoky oak aftertastes.
3.75,"Good taste, bad reaction to it"
4.0,"I'm always interested in trying distilleries I haven't tasted before and anything different. Usually it's a different wood finish or something. This was a 2 for 1. A distillery I hadn't tried and an independent UK bottling of a Texas bourbon....long story short it works perfectly. The nose screams Dr pepper on steroids (which I really dislike) but then the casking and blending BBR used seems to change it into a brown sugar cinnamon type thing which still tastes a bit like it's cherry but it isn't. It's confusing as my mind says I should dislike it but I don't. Perfect mouthfeel, balance and nice finish. Even more interesting is the story behind the distillery Ironroot Distillery. To quote ""Our philosophy is heavily influenced by the history of our Texas town, Denison, where local viticulturist T.V. Munson helped save the French wine industry from destruction with his Texas “iron” grape roots. His efforts forever linked Denison to Cognac, France and inspired us to learn brandy distilling techniques. We apply those French traditions to Texas corn to make some darn good whiskey."" $60 a bottle great VFM."
