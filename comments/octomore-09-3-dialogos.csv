3.5,"It doesn't have a terribly strong smell, but it does have some bitter, do h peat notes at the bottom. There's something mushroomy about the nose, but on the whole it isn't super exciting. It smells a bit like gauze. This smells more like regular scotch than most of the Octomores do. The palate is also more standard with notes of old socks and gross bread coming in. The flavors are fairly piercing with some floral and light fruit notes slipping in. It's kind of like sea spray with that peaty rubber mixed with some floral and fruity elements. The fruits stick to the likes of apple and lemon, but at least that's something. There isn't really any caramel to be found here, but there are wood and rich elements. It's OK, but not particularly enjoyable. There are kind of some seaside and herbal complexities, but they are subtle. It might be more balanced than Laphroaig, but it's also less assertive and interesting. Some grain does come through, but it isn't terribly exciting. Yeah, there's something here, but it tastes a lot like more alcoholic Laphroaig 10 and it's about as good with water added. The hint of citrus on the finish is nice though."

3.5,"Nose: Peaty and grassy

Palate: Peaty and grassy similar to nose, sweeter on tongue"
4.0,"100th review - wow.

Nose - Vanilla, powered sugar, custard, some pastry crust, and of course a huge smoke bomb.  

Taste - sweet vanilla, toasted bread, surprisingly some oak (pop sickle stick), of course huge amounts of smoke.

Finish - just a mouth coated with nothing but sweet smoke.  

9.3 seems to be a showcase of the new make from octomore and it's insanely good. Creamy mouth feel, huge body, the alcohol is drying.  

230 bucks and you can't have enough of these as backups.  A bit lacking in complexity and it's a bit drying on the mouth.  Otherwise it's amazing."
3.0,Surprisingly not a big fan of the 9.3.  I think there's a transition from the initial taste to smoke that I don't like as it also seems a tad boring

4.25,"Lighter and sparkling, with a surprisingly mild nose (the tasting note about rubber gloves is actually fairly apt), but the comparatively mild ppm makes the finish much more friendly than others in the Octomore range."
4.25,"Nose: lactic liquid smoke. Smoked cheese. Gentle peat, herbal a bit. 
Taste: wow! Thick oily, salty and malty. Deep flavor. Warming. Some distant fruits. Like a whisky fruit pie. Oranges or peaches. Brine. Not your typical peaty Octomore. 
Finish: tart, dry, some more peat and vanilla comes from the back. 

After opening with a few drops of water:
Nose: vanilla, lemon, some cherry hints. 
Palate: honey, malt, grape notes. A bit mellower at first, finished quite sharp. More herbal notes. 
Finish: not very long. Fruity, vanilla. Low peat. 

In general, very interesting whisky, but definitely not what you usually expect from Octomore. Liked a lot, but missed a bit of the peat."
4.5,Amazing balance of peat - a real feat. There are octomore peatier than this but it still packs a punch with vanillic notes
null,"Took a small sample. Very good with notes of peat, creamy vanilla, lemon, and a long spicy finish."
