1.75,Spicy and Vanilla. I liked the nose on this one but taste just was not for me. This will be a mixer bourbon unfortunately. I did not enjoy it neat nor on the rocks. Got it on clearance for 24$ so no harm done to the wallet.

3.0,Cedar and gingerbread. Middle of the road. But excellent name and bottle!
3.5,A great sipper!  Nose gives way to classic flavors of oak and spices.  At 86 proof this was delicious.  Thanks D-Rowe! 11/30/18 AppAlumni Christmas Party.

2.0,This is not bad...but not good either.  Very full of vanilla.  It tastes very young and underdeveloped.  It has a look and feel of a rebranded gimmick.  There are too many great bottles out there to waste time and money on gimmicky whiskey.  Discontinued now in NC... thankfully.  Old Hickory deserved better for his name.
