3.0,"I wouldn’t classify this as a whisky exactly, because it’s loaded down with artificial apple flavour. That being said this is great as a cocktail mixer and it can even be enjoyed on its own over ice. Just remember that this isn’t a pure whisky experience. Overall it’s enjoyable if you like a warm apple cider flavour."

2.25,"This isn't really whiskey, it's more of an apple liqueur.

The nose is exactly like an apple Jolly Rancher. The palate is very sweet and again taste like apple Jolly Rancher. The finish is short and slightly tart.

Not the best choice for sipping, but would make a good choice for certain cocktails."

3.5,"Always enjoyed this as something different. I enjoy this one many different ways. Neat, OTR, mixer with sprite. Excellent spring and summer drink. Low proof and very sweet. I find it quite enjoyable. Its nothing complex, just a sweet and smooth apple whiskey. Has been very easy to find and hope it does not discontinue. Found from 20 - 30$ in my area."

3.5,"During this holiday season, I have had the wonderful opportunity to try several different things and Crown Royal Apple is one of the more divisive liquids in the group. My dad and a few others did not like it at all. While I and some others liked it but it is easy to drink too much of this and be done with it. Now when I first drank this neat it was very nice with the apple flavor mixing well with the whiskey and when ice is added it made the drink even better. I have not mixed this with anything but I have read and heard from friends that it does mix very well and the sweetness is reduced a great deal. I do not like this as much as the Birddog Peach but this is a nice flavored whiskey and by the time I finished drinking a few drinks of this I was not enjoying the sweetness if you know someone that likes apple-flavored things they will most likely enjoy this. Enjoy."

2.5,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 29

One thing that this experiment has taught me: Crown Royal is decent as a distillery. I’m never going to be a fan boy, but I give credit where credit is due. I’ve had three different things from them this year, and they’ve ranged from average to outstanding. This little 50mL marks my fourth look at Crown Royal.

I can’t pretend that this nose isn’t awesome. Reminds me of my favorite sour apple candies. And I mean sour. The scent alone is turning my taste buds.

Body is a bit of a let down, honestly. The sour apple is there, but it’s accompanied by a sickeningly sweet syrup flavor. The nose hinted that there might be a true sour apple bomb here, but at the end of the day, this feels like just another apple liqueur.

The sour apple does linger on a bit here on the finish, but you have to will yourself to forget the syrupy sweet body to be able to enjoy it.

This is fine. I’d say mid to high end when it comes to a liqueur, sub par on any real whisky rubric. That sour apple influence is genuinely interesting, but I feel like they somehow screwed up the sweetness factor. Better than Jim Beam Red Stag, worse than Crown Peach and the glorious surprise that was Piehole.

‘Tis the season. I DO have 2 more new whiskeys lined up. Thanks St. Nick!"
