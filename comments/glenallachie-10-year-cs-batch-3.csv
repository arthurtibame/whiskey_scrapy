3.75,"The alcohol does not sting at all at the nose, letting the warm and fruity aromas flow, which are influenced by both Bourbon and Sherry: vanilla, caramel, ripe figs, dates, red fruits, candied orange, butter cookies, cinnamon. Very rich, with the wood as a background which tends to grow over time becoming drier, while the aromas turn to buttery with a hint of acidity.
On the palate the gradation becomes pungent and spicy, combining cloves and rhubarb with cinnamon, with an acidity more present at the limits of the invasive, along with red fruits, chocolate, licorice, hazelnuts, orange and lemon tip. Full-bodied and oily, with the wood always present and rough, with a bit of bitterness more and more pressing. 
The finish is quite long, dry, of wood, cloves, orange, lemon, licorice.
Alcoholic content not very centered, the wood clears up too much, disrupting the aromas that lose on the palate the amalgam initially perceived on the nose, with the bitterness that tends to eat the pleasantness of the flavors."
