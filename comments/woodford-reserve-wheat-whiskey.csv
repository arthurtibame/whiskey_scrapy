5.0,I was the first to get a bottle when it came off the truck today.  This stuff is smooth as silk.  Heavy vanilla and very light brown sugar sweetness; all a proper wheat bourbon should be.  Still smack’n my lips.
3.75,Definitely taste the new charred oak barrel in the flavor. Its light in body but has a peaty and oily note. I find it similar to Willet. Still a nice purchase for 33.00
4.0,"Grew on me. First wheat whisky. Reminds me of redemption Wheated bourbon. Like redemption better, but this is very good. Bummer they didn’t do a high Wheated 4 grain bourbon instead. So close."

3.5,"Having a hard time with the nose - maybe toast and a hint of banana?  Baking wheat bread?  There is a bit of mint on the nose.

Strong vanilla flavor, quite minty.  Considerably more spicy than I expected, it has a bit of a black pepper bite, especially on the finish.  Someone mentioned bubble gum, I do kind of get that flavor- like the old kind that you'd get in a pack of baseball cards.  I also get a little banana along with that, maybe like a banana bread.

The finish is dry, I feel like the mint lingers into the finish.  Definite whole wheat toast in the finish.

Enjoyabale, but not anywhere close to what I was expecting.  It has quite a bit of spice, despite not having tons of rye."
2.0,Not what expected. Probably won’t buy again but very different. Might grow on me when it opens up. Neat in glen

3.0,"Very fruity on the nose, with a strong taste of banana.  Very easy drink, low spice, limited taste of oak.  Almost tastes like baked Alaska..."
3.5,Woodford knocked it out of the park with this one. Smooth flavor. I’m not one to pick out fancy schmancy flavors out of a hat and say I can taste them so I’ll leave it simple and state that this is a damn fine bottle of whiskey for $32. I’ll probably go back and buy another one later this week.

4.0,"Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey
Pours into my Glencairn a slight reddish hue (or is it just subliminal from the red label?). A quick swirl yields fast moving skinny legs. 
NOSE: A definite floral note. Buttered Toast. Sugary Sweet Pink Bubblegum. Tropical Fruits mainly Banana and Coconut, Hay and Oak. There are light Rye Notes in the background as well.
NEAT: Crosses the front of the palate with Cherry Vanilla Coke sweetness. There is a vague fruitiness throughout. Banana? Cherry? Pear? All seem to be there, but none dominate. A touch of Black Pepper Spice and a healthy shot of Oak. The Malt notes show up on the warming finish with a taste reminiscent of Burnt Brownie Edges and Oak Tannins coating the palate. A Sweet Brown Sugary note really clings and lasts adding some more depth to the next sip. 
SPLASH: Gives the nose a spicy character, and I swear the little bit of rye in the mash bill comes through in a light dill note. Accents the Spicy Oak and Vanilla on the palate. The nose on the empty glass is a dead ringer for Brown Sugar.
Verdict: Very good. A great example of a 4 grain whiskey where each grain contributes their own unique character. Different than Bernheim Wheat, but equally good. 4 Stars."
4.5,"Apple blossom and peat on the nose, Apple fruit on the tongue along with vanilla buttercream, pecan, bergamot, Anjou pear on a long finish.
As one drinks it, the smell is of a log cabin with a fireplace in the fall."

4.25,"Very smooth with still enough bite to linger.  Hints of vanilla, honey, and cherry.  Very solid wheater, tough to beat for the price tag."
3.0,"I enjoy wheated bourbons, Makers Cask and Weller 107 my two favorite. With that being said this is a very enjoyable sip. The nose is very much like all wheated bourbons nothing that you wouldn’t expect. The finish was a bit lackluster to me. It could be because of the low proof but there was no bite to it. It goes down very easy I just prefer a little more spice to it"

3.25,"As a lifetime fan of Woodford Reserve, I had very high expectations for their new wheat whiskey, but really I felt I was left hanging. Sure, I get the sweetness and vanilla that I expected, but got lots of spice and pepper on the palette, which lingers long into the finish and wasn't quite what I was wanting out of this pour. Almost bought 2 bottles when I saw it because I'm such a WR fan, but glad I didn't. This one might sit on my shelf for a while."

Nose is vanilla cake with light cinnamon and allspice. 
Taste is light caramel, vanilla, a hint of banana cream. Enjoyable, but dialed back.
Finish is quick, but leaves you with a banana cream pie hint 

I dig this, but wish it was bolder and more pronounced."

3.5,"Neat.  The nose hits me right between Woodford Double Oaked and Woodford Rye.  Marshmallow, macadamia nuts, vanilla, fresh corn, apples.  So much going on here it is almost overwhelming.  I wasn’t expecting this much depth.  

Okay, strange.  I like the nose so much but the taste hit me so strangely.  It’s all the same flavors as the nose (which I find delightful) but it’s like they don’t quite go together on the tongue.  So much to tease out though.

Nice creamy mouth feel.  Powder sugar and marshmallow dominate the tongue with hint of apple.  More marshmallow and vanilla and apple from there.

It’s such a funky adventure.  I want to like it but it’s so odd that it’s throwing me off in a bad way."
2.5,Woodford missed on this one in my opinion. Tastes overly fruity and finishes hot. Stick to the regular Woodford and don’t waste you money on this.

Delicious sweet, fruity nose.  Think juicy fruit with a touch of cinnamon.  Get red berry/apples touch of classic vanilla, caramel,  brown sugar notes. Not a long finish but decent.  Would absolutely love to try this at cask strength, great sweet delicious dram.  Only thing holding me back is lower proof, short/medium finish."

2.75,Sugar and spice (well a little spice) but not all that nice. It’s ok but lacks fullness. It’s just kind of meh
3.5,"Nose: spicy and wheaty. Almost like the bernheim nose. Nail polish a little bit too, not as potent

Palate: very subtle sweetness. The wheat is up front. I definitely like this one but it lacks the fullness. I wish they’d try a wheated bourbon instead of a wheat whiskey. 
Finish: typical woodford finish with a bit of spice"

3.25,"The nose has some banana, some nuttiness, red apples? and vanilla. Fairly fruity.

The palate is fairly soft and sweet with banana bread, light leather notes and some oak.

The finish is smooth and medium in length, like regular Woodford.

This was fine. I was really hoping it to be similar to other notable wheated bourbons, but I guess this isn’t one, technically it’s a wheat whiskey."
2.75,"Woodford is an interesting brand. Back in the days where we could get Old Pogue for 40 bucks, Van Winkle Lot B was on shelves for 60, Rip van winkle was 27-32 (depending on abv, yes there were two abvs), EC 12 year was a thing and EC18 year was collecting dust on shelves at 60 bucks....well one of the most well respected and though of bourbons was Woodford Reserve.  An NAS bourbon for 30 bucks (about the same prices today) was the non in the know bourbon drinker's idea of what was better than Makers Mark.  At the time I turned my nose up at woodford as it was frankly below par bourbon, for 10 bucks I could get Ancient Ancient age 10 YEAR old and it was better.  Sadly fast forward 15 years and the laughably priced woodford reserve is now actually a pretty good value and we no longer laugh at NAS bourbons as if they're a joke if they cost more than 20 bucks.  

I bring this up to start the context of a review for this new actual wheat whisky, not wheated bourbon.  Woodford has effectively been a brand that has always been respected but has never been a great whisky maker either.  They are consistent and put out quality all be it nothing special.  Their prices have remained consistent and for all that, a brand I used to turn my nose up at, I must say, I've grown to really respect their pricing and consistency so bring on new expressions as long as they don't start asking for premium pricing with an age statement (lets not discuss their 130 dollar bottles).  

Nose - I know it's a bit silly but I smell wheat.  Very sweet much like you'd get with a wheated bourbon.  I get almost rock candy and golden wheat like notes.  I'm getting zero barrel notes.  Perhaps a drop of caramel.  Really deep nosing and I get some toasted notes and a bit of alcohol.  

Taste - You get the woodford element right away, a sort of chocolate and just a classic woodford finish.  The first notes are very sweet almost grape and vanilla.  I do get a hint of nutty notes.  I could see rasberry jam or something instead of the grape as well, maybe some apples or even pears.  This a really fruity note.  On the finish I can get some oak and wood, it's still pretty subtle. 

So in 2019 for 35 bucks, it's a gosh darn good whisky.  Yeah in 2005 this would just sit on shelves for my money, but in 2019 woodford has really hit a winner.  

I'm giving this a 2.75.  I can't say everyone will love this.  If you don't like sweet whisky or you want more abv or you're just someone who wants aged whisky...this is not for you.  If you however just want an easy drinker that's sweet.  I can't recommend it more given that price point."
4.0,Fruity without spice! No burn

4.5,"Different bourbon distilleries are known for different things. Some distilleries use different brands to portray their whiskey (Jim Beam; Buffalo Trace). Some distilleries experiment with wood to bring out thousands of flavor combinations (Maker’s Mark). But, Woodford Reserve has to be the master of grain variation. I have the Corn (standard), the Rye, the Malt, and, now, the Wheat. And I love each one in its own way. This wheat is a fantastic and couldn’t be more inviting on the nose. It has warm caramel and creme characters that come through both on the nose and the palate. I also get this hint of raisin bread minus the cinnamon. Although there are a lot of beautiful baking spices that come through as well. The thing I love about what Woodford does is that, because everything is the same except the grain used, their whiskies open up a huge learning opportunity when it comes to other whiskies. If you love bourbon you must get the Woodford Rye and the Woodford Wheat as these are competing secondary grains in a lot of different bourbons. A lot of bourbons use rye as their secondary grain and some use wheat instead. By comparing the two Woodford’s, it’ll make it much easier to discern what grains are used in a certain bourbon. But, you can’t forget about the malt as well, as most bourbons contain malted barley. Like I said, this is a great whiskey for something different and I recommend having all of the different whiskies that Woodford offers for a fantastic learning opportunity."
3.75,Truly more than decent. Doesn’t quite have the depth as the Bernheim wheat whiskey but delicious all the same. I’ll always keep a bottle of this in my bar.
4.75,Straight up banana bread on the nose and taste. Nice medium caramel finish.
3.75,"Really light and smooth as it's only 90 proof. 51% wheat in the mash bill which makes me happy. I love wheated whiskey. Nose is fairly tame.. bread and slight ethanol. The front is heavy bread but almost closer to shortbread. You get the slightest hint of sweet fruit on the back end with a tiny little kick that finishes easy. Do not add water. It won't do anything and doesn't have enough juice to need it.

83/100 for me. Not good enough to always keep around, but definitely good and something for a change of pace every so often. I imagine it would be a great dinner whiskey. Then have some chocolate cake with a glass of Woodford double oaked to finish the night."

3.5,Astringent and a little bland. Not a fan.
3.75,"Maybe mire if a dark golden than a light amber in color.  The nose is very different.  There is very very little ethanol and the predominant aroma is that of buttered wheat toast hot out of the toaster.  It’s a very grain forward aroma with bits of herbal tea and vanilla underneath.

The palate is soft, smooth and again grain forward with subtle leather and white pepper.  The finish is short with green apple and cereal notes.

Will definitely not be for everyone.  In all honestly the first time I drank it I thought it was flat and almost astringent.  After a second and third try it has really grown on me."

3.75,"Had my first taste of this today in-store, and I immediately bought it.  

At the outset, it is a sweet, juicy, light whiskey that reminds me of ripe, fall apples.  Owing to its somewhat thin body and shorter finish, this makes me think of apple wine with hints of cinnamon and cedar.  I almost want to try it warm.

It's a pleasant sipper that I imagine I could enjoy on a brisk autumn day without thinking about too deeply.  I'm excited to tuck into this a bit more when I have a bit of time."

Nose - a good mix of sweet and spicy. Very light bitter smell and maybe some oranges I’m picking up.

Taste - starts nice light and oily then starts to coat the tongue and bring out some flavors. Nice sweet flavor of vanilla that starts to slowly turn into some cinnamon heat to it. Finish is rather short. 

Overall and value - good sweet and spicy bourbon. I wouldn’t call this anything really unique and complex to my palate but it is good for under 30$ range."
