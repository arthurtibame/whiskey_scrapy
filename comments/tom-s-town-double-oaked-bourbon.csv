3.5,"Light, reddish-copper brown.  Thin body but relatively oily legs.  Rich, cereal-centric Irish whiskey nose.  Plenty of vanilla.

Palate is dominated by vanilla notes, strong menthol, and a relatively pervasive cocoa.  Spicy cinnamon and a bit of ethanol that fades quickly on subsequent sips as the palate acclimates.  A few vegetal notes come along for the ride - definite chili peppers, maybe a trace of that dill from MGP rye.

Overall, hard to complain.  Not perfect but perfectly drinkable at the $30 (sale) price point.  The stave toasting flavor profiles they used show clear similarities to makers 46 ideology but I’m not complaining."
3.75,"A bit of an edge, but good flavor"
