Overall a very barrel forward whisky. I'm not super experienced in Irish single malts, but this doesn't have the buttery mouthfeel, leading me to believe it is not strictly pot still. Very enjoyable."

4.25,"The nose is full of oak. Fruity on the palate, peach, orange peel and then a peppercorn spice arrives that fizzes along the tongue. This one has a wonderfully long finish. Smooth and intense. My favorite combination."
