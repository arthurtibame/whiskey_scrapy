5.0,"Remus II is a very smooth, deep tasting bourbon.  The main taste I got was rich oak, caramel and wheat.  The finish dissipates quickly and leaves you with a molassss flavor mixed with yeast.  Almost like a dark brown sugar flavor without all the sweetness."

2.0,"So this was on sale for about 70 (a bit under actually) so I figured why not. Roughly 10 and 11 year old juice give or take 6 months on both sides. From unquestionably America's best distillery in MGP. 

Nose - Spicy and dusty bourbon. A bit off my standard MGP profile. Still vanilla custard, some rye spice and the blend is pretty heavy in rye. Yeah this is like a vanilla forward rye on the nose.

Taste - Wow I'm getting rye big time. this is not even close to my first pour but today I'm getting a lot of rye. Sweet, apples, huge spices, vanilla, light oak...this is sweet and spice forward.

I'm liking the overall product here. i could use less of the 36% rye and more of the 25% but I think they've made an incredibly nice product here. A bit pricey if you're paying into the 90 dollar range, but if you can get it for in the 60's or 70's I think this is a reasonable pour. MGP continues it seems to sell their best barrels and bottle their middle class stuff. Not a bad thing but a bit surprising."

4.5,"Just delicious. Balanced, not too much rye or too sweet. Perfect middle"
5.0,Delicious !!! Rich and sweet!!! Buy it.
4.0,"Scored this for a significantly discounted price at Costco.

Medium strength nose of smoky barrel char, cherry, vanilla, Coca Cola, watermelon, and a faint hint of grass. No ethanol to speak of. Complex and appealing.

Palate is very “old school”; lots of vanilla, caramel, cherry, and orange peel, developing into a finish of barrel spices, oak, and char. I was searching for how to describe the flavor when it hit me; tastes just like a well made Old Fashioned. Some toffee and mint on the backend when the spices fade. Shorter finish than what I would like. Suitably rich. Flavors transition smoothly and as a whole it’s really well balanced.

Mouthfeel could best be described as “velvety” and is the high point, lending to an easy drinking experience. Drinks slightly under its 100 proof.

I wish I could tell you there’s something truly groundbreaking going on but I can’t. This doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but if aliens landed tomorrow and said “what is this Bourbon you speak of?” this might be one you’d reach for as it’s a great high quality example of what traditional bourbon is supposed to be. At a $68 discount price I don’t regret the purchase. At $90 like I have seen around town? I’m afraid it’s just not unique or special enough to justify that kind of price point."

4.5,"15 min in a Norlan.

Love this nose right from the start. Dark caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and nutmeg. Faint leathery notes on the end too.

Spice, pepper, and orange lead off, then the sweeter notes come in. Kind of like a caramel flan and candied orange peel. Finish is a bit short, but as sweet as it seemed to finish, it left my mouth pretty dry. 

Very nice"

4.5,"Nose is complex with Carmel vanilla baking spice and a hint of berry. 
Up front the Carmel and vanilla take over leading the rye finish. 
Very complex flavors seem to roll across the tongue a more sophisticated pallet will get more form it."

3.75,"Tasting:  2oz neat in glen cairn

Nose (4.0):  Traditional sweet bourbon nose.  Butterscotch and vanilla dominate up front.  I also got a little candy corn.

Palate: (3.75)  Hit me first with a little bit of soap taste that was off-putting.  This dissipated quickly and reminded me of grandma's candy bowl.  I got those yellow sweet butterscotch candies, with sugary cherry slices, and vanilla.  Mouthfeel was buttery and thicker.  If not for that soapiness un the beginning I might have been at 4.25.

Finish: (3.75)  Nice finish. Some peppery notes let you know there is a little backbone to it and it is not all sugar plums and candy corns.  Kind of a quick finisher though.

Overall:  At first I was kind of meh.  After some time with it has some merit to it.  I am not a huge fan of blended whiskies BUT if this is where things are going it is on the right track.  Pricewise though, you can do better.  A lot of work blending these whiskies yielded what in my opinion is an above average bourbon at an elevated price in which I would gladly buy something like a Knob Creek or WT Rare breed for less and get same effect.  If it were $50 that would be great, but over $70 I am not so sure.  As for me,  I am glad mine was a sample."
