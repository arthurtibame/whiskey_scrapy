4.0,"This review is for the small cask strength sample bottle that came with the full bottle. Also note that this is the 10 year version, not the 12

The extreme climate that is home to the Amrut distillery causes a very high volume loss annually to evaporation, 10%+ vs the 1-2% of scotch whisky. This matures the whisky faster, but does not allow for a final product with a high age statement due to the greater loss to those greedy angels. So this 10 year old is, to steal a phrase from the man who provided this sample, ""rare as hens teeth"". 

This single malt clocks in at an intimidating 71% ABV. If I had to guess, it's non chill filtered and natural color. This is a brilliant copper color. The 50mL sample bottle got split 5 ways, and unfortunately a small amount of mine leaked, so I had about 9 mL to work with. Here's what I could gather with what I had to work with. 

The nose begins with a powerful blast of alcohol, as is to be expected given the high ABV. Once it settles down I was greeted with a very fruity profile. Ripe red fruits and a candy-like sweetness. Exotic fruits like mango, pineapple and passion fruit. There was a very light citrus note, like lemongrass mixed with tangerine. I'm not sure if there is any sherry cask maturation, but it had the feel of an Oloroso type sherry, mostly raisins. Caramel and toasted oak at the bottom of the glass. 

Very hot on the palate on the first sip, but it burned so good. At first the taste it was strange but somehow familiar, couldn't quite put my finger on it. Then the tropical fruits came out. Passion fruit, papaya and mango. Hints of toasted oak, cinnamon and maybe nutmeg. Wonderful 

The mouthfeel is HOT up front, oily and mouthwatering. 
Medium long finish with mostly passion fruit and papaya. 

This is a great and extremely rare whisky, especially since this is from that small cask strength sample bottle. Loaded with exotic fruits and a burn that was invigorating. This is my first Amrut, and my first Indian whisky at that. I'm afraid it's probably all downhill after this one. I'm extremely thankful for Pranay who generously shared this one. Thanks buddy. I only wish I had more. Solid 4.5
Cheers"
5.0,"I first off want to start by writing a huge ""thank you"" to Distiller---I requested this be added...and lo and behold, it's on here.  Mikael and team---thanks.   Okay---so, now to the review----this one is for the Greedy Angels 10 yr old, not 12...and for the 71% ABV small sample.  Personally...I loved this.  One of my top drams.  It's a mix of Irish fruity waxiness that's present in a well aged 25 yr old Cooley combined with the elegance of a 30 yr old Highlander or Speysider.  You get a waft of topical fruits---papayas, gauvas, and coconut right at the onset.  This carries through palette, with a long finish.  This is the first Amrut I didn't get cardamon...which is too bad, I love cardamon.   It's only 10 years old, but the Bangalore climate at 100 degrees F all year ages this as if it's a 30 yr old.  Not to mention the rarity----that climate doesn't allow many whiskies to survive into double digits; the angel's share is simply too much, which makes it rare as hen's teeth."
