4.75,"This is really about as good as a young scotch gets.
Nose: Orchard fruit galore, vanilla, wax, slight char. Just a kiss of peat to prevent it from being overbearing and cloying.
Palate: Exquisite viscosity...oily. Extremely mouthcoating. Starts off with a tingle, and then it's sublime. The orchard fruit and earthiness create an immaculate balance. Yin and yang. 
Finish: Goes on for a few minutes. Incredibly pleasant. Leaves mouth with an unreal and spectacular aftertaste. 
The orchard fruits blend with just a hint of peat to please people on both sides of the aisle. The waxy element is almost addictive in how it's simultaneously unusual but yet...familiar."
