3.0,"Sweet Candy Corn aroma, strong sense of vanilla. 
Vanilla on the front with a spicy cinnamon on the finish. Goes down smooth with a hesitant burn. Not overbearing."

4.0,"7/10.  12 Year Cleveland Bourbon Club Pick.  Similar to other MGP offerings, this is a dark rich amber color.  Bubblegum on the nose with a creamy vanilla molasses palate.  My issue is with too much black pepper in the finish.  Otherwise it’s great."
null,Marking this but actually the 12yr SiB

3.0,"Sweet oak and vanilla on the nose slight alcohol bite at the end. Light on the palate with aged oak, tobacco, and rye spice. Finish is slightly hot and a mild. Overall decent but not spectacular."
