3.5,"Appearance: Darker caramel gold is the color of this Colorado single malt, with thin semi-watery legs dribbling their way back down the glass.

Nose: The nose on first approach introduces itself as charred and funky. After opening up, notes come forth like grass, straw and hay, honey, purple clover flowers, melted caramel, cinnamon toast with maple syrup, graham crackers, and brown sugar.

Taste: The palate starts with a surprising heat and burn that never really dissipates throughout the journey. Notes I could detect within the blaze were barrel spices, corn, caramel candies, dark plum, clove, and mint reminding me of a sip from a mint julep.

Finish: The finish is spicy for a while then drops with a woody dryness.

Thoughts: I am drinking from a bottle from “Cask 2” of this whiskey, for those who care. Personally, really enjoy the nose; smelling this is very enjoyable and I could sniff on it for a good while. The taste however, though not unpleasant, is merely more aggressive than I’d like and distracting from the flavors. Besides that, a fine American single malt. Golden Moon, thanks! Cheers!"
