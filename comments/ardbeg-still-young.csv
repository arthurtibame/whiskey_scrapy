4.0,"I finally opened up my little 3cl sample that I had purchased years and years ago.  Back then, I was debating if I should buy a bottle or a sample.  I figured “ a really young Ardbeg...who in their right mind would buy it!?!”.  Yeah.  Shoulda, coulda, woulda...too late.  A simple $40 bottle then is now a rare collector item worth hundreds.  Anyway...this is clearly young.  The label “Still Young” is about as clear as one can get.  It’s young, but my god it’s good.  Nose is just all seaweed and brine.  Taste:  salty, briny, bacon-y, lemon-y...hits the mark.  But the “Still Young” comes in the finish.  Even Ardbeg can’t defy the laws of chemistry...the finish is biting and pinching.  I loved the aroma and taste, but honestly...the finish shows the youth.  It’s not unexpected, right?  Afterall, it’s chemistry.  Not enough time for such an aggressive spirit to settle down with the wood.  If tasted blind without knowing the market value of this, not sure I’d pick up a bottle.  Just too rough and aggressive around the edges."
