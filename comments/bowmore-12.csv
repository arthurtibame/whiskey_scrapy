4.0,"Gold color, clear, and viscous. Nose is rich, with delicate peat smoke, tobacco, hay, dried leaves, and some sea salt. Palate is umami dominated, full body, round texture, with hints of tar and medicinal smoke, salt, oak, seaweed, and caramel on the back. On the second taste notes of dried fruit, peach, butterscotch, and vanilla. Finish is long and complex, with an oak and vanilla base, but with some nuts and fruit on the back. A few drops of water change the smoke characteristic to more of a campfire, palate develops more lemon and oak characteristics. Overall a well balanced dram with moderate amount of peat and a variety of interesting flavors."

3.5,Islay with strong citrus and milder smoke. Good entry into Islays. 40% ABV and easy to drink.
2.5,"On the nose, brine, a little smoke, barbecued bacon and a spritz of orange zest. The palate has a lot more going on, salty, iodine and a real tropical bouquet of orange zest, peaches, maraschino cherries, almost hinting on sherry notes, but ultimately rather thin. A fairly short, dry finish of sea-spray and smoke, those sweet notes evaporating a bit too quickly."

3.75,"First nosing and taste required an adjustment and it has taken me a bit to start getting on board.  An uncommon dram - peat, sherry, and heather require a balance to play nicely together.

First sniffs are deadened and somehow restrained by the gentle peat.  Bread notes, and rich but non-sugary late summer wildflower.  Touch of honey-glazed ham.

The palate yields orange rind, salted meat, chocolate, and a very gentle but pervasive smoke accompanies it all.  Some briney sea breeze.  Clearly more savory than sweet.  A uncommonly complex experience at 40% abv, lacking mostly mouthfeel.  Ash and a subtle astringency linger on the tongue.

Not a home run by any stretch, but once you settle in to embrace the flavor profile, there is a lot to like here.  Peat smoke builds throughout the pour - first few sips was barely noticeable, by the end of the glass the phenols are embedded in your tongue.  Top feature is avoiding too much sweetness... they are closer to a meaty Springbank than many competitors."

4.0,"Somehow I’d never tried anything from Bowmore after all these years of drinking whisky. It’s actually the only Islay whisky I’d never tasted. (Gartbreck and Ardnahoe notwithstanding of course.) I smell honeycrisp apples, smoked ham, some sort of pastry aroma, and spices like allspice and turmeric. The palate brings notes of toffee, peat moss, pinewood smoke, and pork belly. And I kid you not, that pastry note from the nose hits me as a freakin’ wildberry pop-tart. It’s subtle but I’m glad it’s there. (Okay boomer, it’s this amazing pop-tart that has purple frosting with teal blue stripes. A millennial mainstay.) The mouthfeel is smooth and juicy at the front and feels more tannic and astringent rear palate. Swallowing, this malt loses its sweet and fruit-based notes, emphasizing a salty and smoky finish of short to medium length. It tends to stay at the hard palate and gently lighten one’s senses. A reliable, everyday Islay."

4.0,"Colour:
The caramel colouring is clear visible, but not a problem for me.

Nose:
This is interesting. Peat Smoke present, but in a very pleasant way.
As a whisky newby I made the mistake to taste Laga 16 as my first peated dram. Needless to say Laga shocked me and chased me away from Islay back to Speyside.
When I found courage to taste this pleasent Peat-smoked dram, Bowmore took my hand to show me how interesting peat can be when it’s moderate and combined with other aromas like sweetness and citric smells. No biting alcohol.

Palate:
Bowmore 12 continues with its warm but soft character. No sharp spicyness, in fact its a very easy sipping dram which has not that complex mouthfeel but the Tastes that are there are just right: clear sweetness, few smoke, nearly no alcohol sharpness. And a decent but nice saltiness at the end.

Finish:
While the peatsmoke was nearly absent on the palate imo it returns here, but again very soft and pleasent.
It is coupled with a nice warmth that stays some time without being aggressive at any time.


Conclusion:
As a peat smoke newbe who was way to overburdened with Laga 16, this one was my Second visit on Islay and whould be the peatsmoke Start of my Choice for Everyone like me who Shares the fascination of the peating process and wants to dig into it.

4/5

Looking forward tasting Bowmore 15 & 18"
4.0,"It's Islay so there is a peatiness, but a nice mild ammount of peat that playfully pats the peat to yer pallet. ...Peat... Its smooth, with carmel and leather, and a toasted peanut brittle that was left in the oven a little too long. Burnt. Burnt peanut brittle thats now a tad bitter. Were you eating peanut brittle, you'd wretch, but for scotch, its actually a pretty inviting little note. Like being deep in the woods and finding an old stucco n wood tudor cottage that has been abandoned for 200 years. Open that door and take a musky whiff. Thats Bowmore. Like being transported to old world scotland with a hint if Hansell and Gretel."

First thing that jumps out is a medium barbecue smoke. Alongside that is a grassy and light honey sweetness which reminds me of a German lager. This isn’t a strongly flavored scotch, but it’s greater than the sum of its parts, and a really comforting drink once you get acclimated to the smoke."

2.75,"Another Islay smoky to try. Have read good reviews and been eying this for a while. Poured neat, nose has a bit but not overwhelming smoke. Has peat, black olive and lots of brine with some used pencil eraser shavings. Not picking up much sweetness, maybe some malt and bread notes. Palate is very salty with peat smoke, more olive and thin malt with a touch of vanilla. Finish of parched wood, olive, malt and peat with lingering smoke. I can confirm McLellands is the same juice just much younger. The oily diesel note is there only aged and seasoned. Its more dry and salty than any whisky ive had. Doesn't have the rich malt or sweetness buried in most Islays. Its a different profile for sure, not quite my cup of tea but I like it more as I go through the bottle.....its not bad (its still 12 yr single malt Islay) but at price paid ($44)there are many I prefer..........79/100..........If you like peat smoke, salt and olives this may be in your wheelhouse"

2.25,Overall this malt is lacking. Rather thin and missing in the flavor department. They must be using really old barrels for the 12 year.

Then in the second wave you get apple skins, mild vanilla, black licorice/anise, and just a second wave of that peppery goodness. It is a tad boggy the more water you add to it. The finish is spectacular; it's like getting a second dram for free. 

It's got a dryness to it, with tobacco leaf and not much sweetness that I can pick up. It has a kind of peppercorn dustyness that I'm just crazy about. 

The smoke is mild enough for non-fans, but prevalant enough for smoke-heads. (Is that a thing?) A touch of earthy herbs round things out; hint of potting soil. I'm just absolutely smitten with Bowmore 12. Let this one linger longer."

One of my favorite things about peated whiskeys is the smell often conjures for me a specific scene of some kind. Sometimes specific memories of being in a forest, the smell of a rotted old log, or a fire, or the smell of leaves and trees. This one conjures the image of being on the edge of a forest near a beach with a campfire burning nearby.
The taste bears this image out, emphasizing the earthy aspects, with some zest. There's a little bit of chocolate with some cherry towards the end, and a long warm peppery mellow finish."

Palate: Rounded notes of vanilla and honey.  Very friendly.  The peat carries through, but in a really nice, almost pretty way.  Some barrel character - the ex bourbon cask shows up, albeit in a subtle way, including some tannin.  Key lime, whipped cream.  Floral, but in a sweet perfume way.  Mouthfeel is medium light.  Finish begins with a rush of what you get on the nose alongside some nutmeg and whole lot of tannin-driven texture.  The sweet and floral notes start to fade away while the phenol comes forward, as well as this star anise, fennel character.  And eventually you're left with this dance between bitterness, honey, and phenol.

Other notes: This executes against the Islay profile incredibly well, really leaning into the rubber and phenol but in a way that many might find appealing.  If you want a gateway into Islay, this might be one ticket.  Also a great example of a nose and palate presenting quite differently.  Not necessarily my personal style, but quite good nonetheless."

On the palate  is hot and spicy but not too hot or too spicy. Nothing special here, maybe ashes and oak. Medium body, finish is short and a little woody.

4.0,"Bought this bottle during coronavirus “stay at home” order, 2020. Pretty sure Charles Maclean recommended this while we were in Scotland"

3.0,Lighter on smoke than expected. A bit of brine and chocolate on the nose. Sweet on initial taste with a subdued finish. Very subtle which may make it a good beginner Islay.
4.0,"Nose: sweet, maritime notes and ash. Some fruity notes. I can hardly smell any smoke from this.
Palate: sweeet, dark.
Finish: some ash, some bitterness, light spices."
4.0,"Nose
Medicinal first, maybe adhesive bandages.  As my nose adjusts,I start to get a smoked honey character as well as some floral notes

Palate
Peat initially, but just like the nose, some sweetness follows. Cloves, baking spices and some dried fruit. Vanilla.

Finish
Mossy bitterness and damp oak transitioning into a bitter spiciness on the posterior palate.  Medium length.

The bitter/sweet complex of this whisky seems to translate through the different components of this scotch.  This is a good go to value Islay scotch for someone who doesn't want a faceful of peat.  Don't get me wrong though, there's no mistaking this as an Islay, which was proven by my four year old saying ""Daddy why does your breath stink?""!"
4.5,C'est vrai on a le goût du bourbon mélangé avec le goût Islay. Très bon mélange a prix abordable. Un très bon entre-deux.
1.5,WAAAAY overrated.

3.25,Not as big a fan as others. Quite sharp and can’t really handle water without fumes. A little peat is nice and I like the citrus. Good price point.
3.5,Slightly sweet with a hint of smoke.  Pretty mild overall with little complexity.

4.25,"Unmistakably Islay, the powerful nose is that of the sea and smoke.  The front rises to the pallet like a mighty peated wave.  However, the strength of the peat and smoke gives way to subtle hints of leather, pepper, and cherry through to the finish.  While the charm of Islay is strong, it never overpowers the senses.  This whisky is true to it's region, to be enjoyed by veteran lovers of smoke and neophytes alike."

3.5,"Very earthy, peaty but without punch, little acidic/briny, the overall combination of the states is not bad, but out of my preferences."
4.0,"Nose: You first smell the  smoke and ash but it makes way for bergamot, orange zest, lemon slices and some hay very little though . It then become floral which is very interesting 

Palate: it’s deliciously Well rounded, up its honey, Vanilla, smoke. It does have the touch of Peat with oily sweetness. A few drops of water really open it up.

Finish: it’s Smoky and long very satisfying and engulfs you in the Sea spray, dry grass, a touch of ash and citrus.

Colour: golden or light amber.

Overall: Its very classy and Smoky, fruity, coastal all at the same time. Well worth trying if want to stay on the low end of peat."

3.75,"Nose: sweet and smoky, Taste: vanilla, sweet up front that quickly warms with a peaty, smoky, briny flavour. It finishes almost with a shelled peanut note. A great introduction into Islay malts. Will definitely it again!"

3.75,I finally found an Islay I really enjoy. Good nose where the peet is definitely there but the taste is “soft” and not so abrupt. Yeah!
3.75,Decent everyday whiskey smooth and sweet with very soft expressions of peat

3.75,This bottle was a funky adventure.  It definitely evolved the longer the bottle was open and I recommend letting it breathe a few weeks before really enjoying.  The best way I know to describe it is to imagine the strong peaty nose of Caol Ila and a taste of salted focaccia bread with a hint of vanilla.

4.0,"First taste of Islay smoke. Glad I started light, wasn't a fan on the first taste but gets better every time I try it."
5.0,"My favorite of the Islay’s, so far."
null,"Turf, scherpe neus. Krachtig."
3.75,A toned down example from Islay. An easy sipping dram that has some of the smoke and savory notes without being over powering. Good bang for the buck.
5.0,"Very smooth, lightly peated."
