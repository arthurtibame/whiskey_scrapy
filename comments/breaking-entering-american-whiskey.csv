3.5,"Interesting flavor combos that come in waves - front is bourbon rounded sweetness, then the nutty high notes of the malt, followed by the spice of the rye. They don’t fold into each other so much - each is kind of its own note - which makes for a kind of bunjee-jump of an experience when I was hoping for more of a fluid rollercoaster. But expectations aren’t experiences, and it’s a fine pour, and an above-average old fashioned (super light on the sugar/bitters)."

3.5,Hints of butterscotch on the nose Lovely single malt notes on the initial sip. I just wish there was more of a lengthy finish.
2.75,Better then the 1st taste where the vanilla flavour was overwhelming.

3.5,"Nose: Vanilla and rye spice dominate.  Oak, brown sugar.  Fennel/herbaceous anise, cardamom, bready.  Black pepper.  Slight floral perfume note.  The slightest suggestion of brine.  Banana, red and green grape.

Palate: Vanilla, oak, brown sugar, banana, strawberry, watermelon.  Cream cheese frosting.  Slight tannin.  Bubblegum.  Fennel, cardamom, clove all present, but much less than on the nose.  Maybe a hint of barrel char.  Finish has a slight negroni-like quality to it.

Other notes: This is an unusual one.  The nose presents like a decent rye, while the palate is like a decent bourbon.  The balance of flavors here is mostly good, though characteristics are mostly in the low and mid palate notes.  Nothing really bright and shiny.  This doesn't command your attention like some other things might, though there's enough here to go exploring.  Reminds me a bit of what's coming out of Splinter Group.  A decent enough bottle at the price point that I might buy it again.  Maybe."

2.5,"Nose: citrus and acidic

3.75,"Nose: Candied fruit sweetness - though not Fruit Stripe levels.  Honeyed, toasted cereal grains.  Reminded of the smell and taste of a bowl of Cheerios with white sugar and sliced bananas, sans milk.  Black tea and leather in the background.  Baking spices and a touch of dried herbs.

Palate: Honeyed cereal grains, vanilla, and cream.  Oak.  Tannin that almost has a salty layer to it.  Bananas and berries.  Licorice with a little mint.  Medium mouthfeel.

Finish: That bitterness comes forward followed by vanilla, nuts, and earth.  Slightly sour/lactic tang thing shows up.  Dill and licorice come forward along with some black pepper, and then everything slowly fades away.  Medium short finish.

Other notes: I don't remember this one being so out of left field.  I have a feeling that my palate may be off tonight, but there are layers and depth here that I don't recall.  Absolutely worth a go if you're looking for something approachable while still providing some interesting depth and complexity."

3.5,"Nose: Malt, vanilla, and citrus.

Palate: Thin with a mild rye spice. Dominant notes of vanilla and orange peel. 

Finish: A quick end with a flare of rye and oak.

Not as good as the Breaking and Entering Bourbon. Worth buying for the comparison, but wouldn’t reach for this in any other situation."
