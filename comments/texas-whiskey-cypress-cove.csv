4.0,"Sweet, little spice like cinnamon and a nice pleasant finish that reminds me of mint. Great value-I’ll be buying another when this is out."
2.25,"Good, sweet, light, TX whiskey.  No real mid drink rye bite but a mellow transition to a light finish into that 90 proof heat.  Does not hold up to water.  Drink it straight.  Perfect daily drinker.  Decent bang 4 the bucks here."
