4.0,"If you love the taste & ingredients of craft beer, this is a unique product.Due to the high % it needs a little water or ice to calm it down. The labels describe it perfectly. Not overly complex but many layers of goodness. Vanilla is instantly recognized as well as the chocolate oatmeal stout. One great quality is the aroma. Took me longer than usual to taste it as I was stuck in the nosing phase. Not for everyone but I found it a step up from my craft beer habit. I have many very fine scotch in my collection but still found a time & place for this expression."
4.0,"Very smooth with a chocolate stout flavor. What it lacks in maturity, it makes up for in ingenuity."

3.75,This is an interesting one.  You can tell it’s young but it has a lot of interesting flavors going on and they all work very well together.
