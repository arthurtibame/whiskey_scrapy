2.0,"Quite ""anodyne"" as Ralfy would say. Smooth and lacking complexity. Probably a good intro to scotch. I'll be using it as a mixer."
4.0,"To me this stuff is great for the price. I was never a huge scotch fan until I got introduced to this by a friend. I am forever in his debt as I am now hooked. It's quiet smooth, easy to drink and wonderful flavor. It's now a regular."
4.0,"Heerlijk. Top blend, beter dan menig single malt"

3.0,"A good, basic  scotch for those that like a smooth blend with not much by the way of smoke or peat.  Primary characteristics are vanilla, some fruit, and a touch of honey.  Similar to Glen Moray.  Not a long finish but a good easy drink."

3.0,Apple juice complements a fruity nose. I experienced a peaty finish that seemed to fester in my chest. A very drinkable whisky that would complement a fire on a cold winter evening.
4.0,"The Dimple Pinch, a 5 year old blended scotch whiskey from Haig distillery. Price $41.99 sampled 10/27/15 with 2 teaspoons of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.

Aroma - Banana, vanilla cake, soft gentle fruits, light allspice, lightly herbal, pear and  notes of tea and fudge.

Taste - Measured arrival, light vanilla, light fruit and raisin. A working man's scotch, but smooth, tasty and easy drinking.

Finishes with a quickly fading flavor and burn.

Final score : 4 / 5, this receives high marks becsuse for what it is, it's high quality. A session sipping blend with an engaging and somewhat complex nose, simple and unchallenging yet tasty flavor and the price is right. Will buy again."

3.0,"I bought this without realising there was some peated Whisky in the blend. I tried a peated single malt a while ago and didn't like it at all. But after tasting this I might have to try them again. There's just enough smokiness in the finish to let you slowly get used to it. I'm liking this one. Smooth, and a little smokey"

2.0,"This blend smells VERY sweet. I am not opposed to sweeter whisky, but smelling this almost reminds me of a tequila like sickly sweetness that is not to my liking. 
    Thankfully the taste is not at all offensive. It's not particularly notable for anything either. An initial sweetness turns to a light(very light) hint of peat on a fairly dry finish, which while not bad, is also not at all interesting. The scotch itself would be a middle of the road 2.5 stars if it weren't for the price. The bottle was $42. For ten dollars less I could have purchased Johnny walker black(a much more interesting blend) or for $10 more I could've picked from a handful of single malts. 
    
      It's not all bad. Dimple is dangerously drinkable. Hardly any burn even when neat. And though the finish isn't amazing, it certainly won't prevent you from taking frequent sips.
      
      But simply put, there are other options around this price point that have far greater depth, and if all you want is a smooth drinkable whisky, it should not cost 40 bucks."

3.0,"This is a very simple and well rounded blended scotch. Sweet and peat on the nose - thick honey and slight vanilla followed by an even whiff of peat that smells like you’re sitting next to a peat fire. Very palatable but not complex. Got bored trying to break down flavors after 30 seconds and realized it’s just an easy sipper.

Probably a good intro to peated whisky. My grandpa loved this stuff so I had to try it. Probably wouldn’t buy again though."

4.0,"This is great. Expecting worse reading the reviews, but still ordered it because I’ve literally never heard of this before tonight. A very pleasant scotch blend, lots of sweet vanilla and caramel notes throughout so I’d definitely start people on this if they were scotch newbies. Smooth, sweet, and floral - I personally would enjoy a little more peat but there is a bit there if you hunt for it. Not super complex but I’d call it a very enjoyable “session” whiskey for any occasion."

3.0,"Sweet, slight smokiness to the nose, almost chocolate scent. Not complicated on the pallet. Sweet, hint of smoke to the finish. Easy to drink but doesn’t overly stand out."
3.0,"Nose has honey and caramel with baking spices. 

A balanced and warm taste, with smooth toffee notes and a caramel cream. 

Short finish with minimal heat, hints of fudge and cream on linger. A slightly oaky finish."

2.5,"A tad too sweet for my taste. Honey, vanilla, and the faint whispers of peat. Demands an ice cube to tone down the vanilla. For blended under $50, I'll take Monkey Shoulder all day long."
2.75,"Dimple Pinch a blended scotch, is from the Haig Brothers company, and just as Haig Club which is a single grain, is not an amazing whisky. I hoped for more, specially since it is a 15 year old. On the nose it tries to be special but it didn't accomplish it. Hints of smoke (specially if you smell the whisky in the bottle once opened), with a weak vanilla, apple and a very hidden grape aroma. On the palate it is so hot that you cant feel any other notes than the hotness, and the ending is the best part, nothing special, but long and a little spicy. It could be labeled as ""ordinary""."
3.0,"Low peat
Sweet
Honey
Great blend"
2.75,Heavy column still taste once peaty initial taste fades (quickly).  My bottle was 10 years old past blend date. Love the bottle design though.
3.5,"Rich, salty and some floral notes"
