5.0,I was hesitant at first but this just gets better every time I taste it. Good and goes nicely in rotation with a Glendronach Parliament 21

4.0,Sweet oak and plum / apricot nose. Fragrant and wonderful. The first taste is sweet with honey and cloves. A bit of heat and spice. The finish lasts and lasts: smooth and delicious. 94/100. $179.95 @ lcbo

4.0,Ridiculously smooth! Most nose of vanilla and bit floral. Tastes mildly fruity but not overwhelmingly sugary or sweet. Clean quick finish. Watery mouthfeel. Pretty good dram that could go down too damn quick.

4.0,"A very nice and smooth whisky by Macallan, and in many ways almost a twin sister to the No. 2. Thanks to the sherry casks, you have a syrupy liquid with notes of clove and dried prune. Raisins and vanilla also dance in your tongue as it leads into a finish that is regretfully too quick and too forgotten. Still, it's good."

4.0,"2 and 3L - love the warmth. The nose is rich with caramel, plum, spice, apple and elegant oak aromas; on the palate you will find layers of figs, raisins and date with buttered toffee, vanilla and ginger notes followed by a warm, smooth long finish.
COLOUR

Sienna

NOSE

Opens with a subtle vanilla nose, persistent yet not overpowering. Orange elbows its way in, turning zesty and sharp, though tempering green apples add freshness and balance. Next come white chocolate truffles, chewy, sumptuous, with elegant oak notes for a digestif.

PALATE

Dates, figs and raisins lead, then defer to nutmeg and ginger with a hint of oranges and apples, before vanilla returns in majesty.

FINISH

The final fanfare is gentle, smooth and warming."

3.0,"Fairly rich sherry and slight honey sweetness up front that fades almost immediately to sherry and oak spice, finishing dry on the tongue. Certainly more richness than Gold or Amber. Good but expensive. While it’s spicier, I’d take Glendronach for a more interesting profile at half the price. $190 in Ontario."

4.0,"Nose: Sherry, spicy over-ripe oranges, rose-hip tisane, rockmelon, sandalwood, vanilla, caramelized apples sprinkled with cinnamon, barley sugar.

Palate: A rich and velvety soft arrival, honeyed but with a little balancing oak dryness. Lots of different fruits, led by blood oranges, dates, caramelized figs, sweet apples, sultanas, apricots, black cherries and cranberries. Raspberry jam. As the development continues there is a sherry note and then a rich Christmas fruit cake makes an appearance. A handful of subtle spices (cinnamon, clove, cardamom, caraway) in the background of the fruitcake with some mixed peel and almonds. Very full and mouthcoating. This is a seriously nice fruity palate.

Finish: Medium-long, fruity and sugary sweet. Almonds and hazelnuts in the end. Lingering and very enjoyable.

Similar in many ways to Macallan Amber (unsurprisingly) but with a lot more depth and maturity.  You need to taste all the 1824 series in order to appreciate how they escalate in quality. IMHO the spirit is identical but the better expressions receive longer maturation in increasingly better casks, with an also increasing input of first-fill.

For example, the palate here has a strong berry and rich fruit profile rather than the lighter citrus/tropical palate of the Amber expression, or the very light and dry citrus of the Gold. Also, the fruitcake flavours in the palate are richer and appear more gradually here, whereas in the Amber they jump at you suddenly and are not as developed, and in the Gold they are barely formed and more like yeasty bread.

It's quite a sweet profile overall but never cloying and without even a suggestion of bitterness or sourness. A satisfying and approachable whisky and a fine example of modern Macallan style at its most successful.  Like the Amber expression, this sings a song of summer to me, but it's a performance to enjoy at dusk or on a balmy evening.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.5,Beautiful whiskey.
4.5,"Nose not quite as good as the Classic Cut, but the taste is much better. Goes down very easy, very dangerous! :)"
4.5,"Enjoyed a variety of good scotches on a night out.  Started with Highland Park 12 and then asked for a Macallan - waitress’ choice.  She brought a Macallan Sienna which had a rich colour and strong sherry notes.  The abv is perfectly balanced and this is a delicious dram.  Followed up with Highland Park 18.  Highland Park’s nose reminds me of the Harry P. Leu Rose garden in Orlando, Florida - a beautiful mix of floral and earth notes - there is a spot in the rose garden that instantly brings HP to mind.  The finish is delightful with a touch of spice. In other words, I’m a fan.  That said, Sienna has a better nose and better balance.  Sienna is very good. 

I was disappointed to discover that this Sienna is a C$190 bottle here - that’s a healthy price.  Do I recommend it - absolutely.  Would I pay C$190?  No, Highland Park 12 is the winner when price is considered."

3.75,"Wasn't as smooth as other Macallan's from the 1824 series. The Sienna has a bit of a bite to it. The dark amber colour matches the dark, bitter taste of the Sienna. Intense is a great word for it. 
If you're an avid Scotch ""go-er"" and are looking for something with a bit of attitude, the Sienna is the Whisky for you."

5.0,Delicious fruity scotch
4.25,"I had high hopes for this dram, and when i opened the bottle the aroma was so nice that my expectations rised a little bit. The palate was dissapointing and the finish short. For $90 a bottle, i don't think it is a worthy dram. 

Bottled at 43%abv, with a SIENNA color (tawny) which comes natural, and there is where this bottle catches its name.

On the nose is really beautiful. Sherry notes, caramel, syrup, candy, liquorice and some herbal notes.

On the palate is not what you expect. This is a hot dram, liquorice notes, the sherry note is too dim, tobacco note is solid and the most remarkable flavor is ashes, with a bitter short finish.

Overall i give this dram an 83 over 100, and it didn't live to its marketing."
