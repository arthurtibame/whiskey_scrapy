3.5,"Nose: crisp, light, peppery, salty with hint of vanilla
Body: medium
Palate: more full than the blended oak, sweet (bourbon notes), honey and rose petal
Finish: medium
Note: I like this more than the blended oak has more body but still light. Also reminds me of sake, maybe rice. I think is a corn distillate but this must have rice in it with a sake undertone."

3.75,"Smell: vanilla, caramel
Taste: uniquely complex, orange, sweet
Mildly spicy finish"
3.75,"It's an interesting whisky. I can definitely get the typical bourbon smells from it along with a citrusy smell and taste. The finish has a bit of an orange peel. It's not absolutely amazing but, I would still recommend this to someone who enjoys both bourbons as well as Japanese whiskies."
4.0,Fruity notes then a bit grainy/woody.
3.5,"Light but tasty, unique flavor"
