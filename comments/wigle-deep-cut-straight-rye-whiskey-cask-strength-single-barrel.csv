My Notes:
The nose of the whiskey is delightful.  It features a heavy spice of cinnamon and allspice with a sweet cherry and vanilla foundation.

On the tongue the spirit is incredibly spicy, but not to the point of overpowering the flavor.  There is an incredible complexity to the drink.  It features a light oakiness in the beginning that transitions to sweet cherry and spice.  It is difficult to pull out particular spices from the flavor.  The vanilla is present throughout the drink and the lightest hint of chocolate surfaces in the finish.  The whisky has a strong bite that settles into a pleasant glow in the chest.  Best enjoyed straight and unadulterated.  Too good for mixing or diluting with icemelt."
