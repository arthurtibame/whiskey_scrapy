5.0,"Nose: sharp fruit and floral. A whiskey doesn’t even come to mind.

Taste: light sweetness, no spicy tongue bite at all. Then a nice level of peat and glorious alcohol fumes fill your sinuses. Finishes with a plum taste and a little warmth."

4.5,"Nose- ginger, mushy bananas, butterscotch, vanilla

Palate- bananas, caramel, ginger spice, light smoke, vanilla, butterscotch

Finish- medium, creamy finish with notes of butterscotch and light smoke

Really really nice overall. Fantastic nose, matching palate, and a finish that is just good enough. Could be longer, but the banana on the nose and palate is really enticing to me. I wish I could find this on shelves, but unfortunately, since it’s discontinued, I won’t be seeing another. Would be a perfect ~$80 drinker."

3.75,Tastes so much more Mr. Miyagi rather than Rob Roy or Braveheart. I prefer the taste of the Scots to the Japs I guess (Bruichladdich rocks!) but this is well worth the price of a dram.
