4.25,"Ardmore is one of my favorites. This expression is almost an islay malt for its profile, but it is a good dram. 

46%abv, amber color.

On the nose: Rubber, Alcohol note is strong; Nerf toys (like tenis balls or something similar); after a couple minutes Dark chocolate opens. Prunes peel. Some salty island profile, even for a highland.
Milk chocolate.

On the palate is brutal. Ashy at maximum levels. Oaky at maximum levels. Black pepper. Medicinal notes. Rubber just as ardbeg or laphroaig, very similar to these two.

Finish long and sulphuric. Some acid like burn, but strangely pleasant. Very balanced. 

Overall i score this dram with an 88 over 100. Ardmore is always solid. Cheers!"
