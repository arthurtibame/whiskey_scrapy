4.5,"Blended so no dominate taste, light on the pilate smooth on the swallow. Rests easy on the after."
4.0,"I have every version of Crown Royal available, that I know of anyways. Although I still haven't tried any of the Noble editions or the Crown Royal XR Red from the Waterloo collection, I just opened my spare bottle of XR Blue.
I'm not an experienced whiskey connoisseur so I'll just explain it from an everyday guys point of view. The first taste was very smooth with hints of vanilla. Very nice. About 2 minutes later my second taste was more spicey with a little more heat as I swallowed it, more similar to regular Crown Royal deluxe. But it was the third taste and the others afterwards that really were the best. Very smooth, no spicy burn, just a wonderful smooth taste throughout.  I wouldn't add any water or ice since it is very smooth and easy going. I'm not going to try to explain any flavors or smells, I'm definitely not that experienced to explain that. I will say I've had Glendronach 15yr Revival and 18yr Scotch and those are better in my opinion. But if you can get this for around $100-$120, and you love Regular Crown Royal you probably wont be disappointed. I like the Cask 16 and Monarch slightly better, but this is still an excellent Canadian Whiskey. I can't wait to open my Red Bottle of XR!"

3.0,"$130 - Michigan. Mine is the red label with some whiskey from the closed Waterloo Distillery, not the LaSalle Distillery with the blue label. Nose (Neat): Sweet and Spicy. Vanilla caramel, toasted almond and slightly floral. Palate (Neat): Spice of the rye with light caramel hints. Super smooth with next to no heat or burn.  Finishes with a slightly bitter butterscotch. Great for sipping and would not recommend on ice or adding water since this is very gentle. Very good, but there are better Canadian blends for lesser prices (Crown Royal Cask 16 if still keeping it in the Crown Royal family)."

4.0,"This review is for the original XR red. Very smooth, sweet rye with gentle spice, light vanilla sweetness. Production ended a while back. I believe I paid around $170 for it in a duty free store about 12 years ago. I grew up in the Waterloo area and this was the first good quality bottle of booze I bought solely because it had some of the Seagrams Waterloo Crown in it. My opinion on it has varied over the years but having just finished the last glass I feel like, if it was still available, I’d purchase it again. It was great Canadian Whisky with a story to tell."
