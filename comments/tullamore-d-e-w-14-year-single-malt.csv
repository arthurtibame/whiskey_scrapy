Flavour: Apples, comes with a bit of an alcohol hit.

Finish: Not much of a finish, hint of lingering vanilla."

3.0,"Still in Hartford. Ventured into Vaughan’s once more. Tullamore Dew stocked on the shelf.  Asked for a neat pour of the Single Malt 14 for a nightcap. 

The nose is all fruit and sugar. Apricots and bananas in a brown sugar reduction. The typical
Irish note of straw.  Throw is some tropical coconut and honey. 

Thin bodied mouthfeel with a gentle sweetness. The palate is all demerara sugar, honey with a some fruitiness/tartness of Granny Smith apples towards the back end.  Not much complexity or depth, but works well within itself. 

A small amount of white pepper spice on the finish with cinnamon apple crumb pie sweetness that rapidly switches gears and returns to the an oaky spiciness, though ever so gentle.   

Inoffensive, straightforward and undynamic yet enjoyable for its sweet simplicity. [84/100][Tasted: 4/12/18]"

4.0,"had this side by side with bushmills 16. the 16 edged this out because of the fruity jam awesomeness, but this is still delicious regardless. Buttery mouthfeel, and candied sweetness. not as much fruit as the bushmills 16, but it's still there. nice lingering and pleasant finish."

4.0,"Ah Tullimore Dew might not not have been my first but it was my staple living in Ireland and one of the drops that made me think hey whiskey isn't to bad. I didn't drink it straight that was another decade before I went down that path. I used to take a hip flask into the pub get a pint of water and drop a dram or two in. Yeah I know cheap but hey mid 20s and very little money was my excuse. Also drinking that much water helped stave off hangovers.... the oddities of youth. Anyhow I saw this and the 18 yr samples and thought ah for nostalgia...not that I drank the aged statements. Mine was the bog std stuff. I like this,  brown sugar green apples. Usually I don't like the latter but with the oily spiciness it pulls it off. I'd poured this dram b4 I realised the stir fry had ginger and garlic.. usually a match I stay away from but the dram pulled through and maybe it even complimented or perhaps diminished the components I might not usually like...or maybe its the psychology of nostalgia.."

4.0,"It's a sign of our times that I wanted to make a Roy Moore joke about the age of this dram, but I'll refrain. This dram is a perfectly gentle, pleasant spot of whiskey - the Distiller tasting notes are in keeping with my own experience, though I'd add pear skin (yes, specifically the skin...that fruity, yet slightly tannic and dry sensation you get from a pear with a thick skin) to the finish. It brings things to a tight finish, after the green apples, hay, light vanilla, and honey work their magic. Very nice indeed; definitely shouldn't be banned from your local mall! I mean, what?"
4.25,"Honey, spice and apple nose. 
Grain and honey taste, hint of spice 
Green apple on the finish"

3.5,"A light sniff on the nose generate a wonderful combination of sugary and dry fruits. Citrus, toffee and species running on the side. You can also tell that the sherry notes are slightly deeper close to Dalmore 12's sherry notes but not quite there yet.

While the golden liquid flowing down into your month, you immediately notice lignins and tannins from most likely an American Oak started to explode in your month. At the same time you can also taste slight sourness  from the other wine cask and it's not too much so it makes it interesting for me.

A medium to long finish with some spices, lignins and tannins. Like a dry black tea that bitterness with only a tiny drop of honey.

Overall, a good whisky with enough complicity. But personally I just wish the finish was better."

3.75,I love this whiskey. It’s a little sweet and very smooth with an easy finish. It has a mild woody/natural flavor.
