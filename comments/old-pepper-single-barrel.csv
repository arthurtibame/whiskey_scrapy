4.0,"Barrel#G18P.  115.1 Proof.  A high ryed bourbon (35% rye). Vanilla, honey, and rye on the nose, kelsea smells cherry coke.  Caramel, honey, menthol, and oak on the palate.  Kelsea also tastes sage. A long spicy finish."
4.5,"Honey and vanilla, with a lot of spice at the end. The spice lingers. It’s not overly sharp but a good balanced bite of rye with the sweeter notes"
3.5,Spicy with a long finish.  Good but not worth the price for me.

3.5,Kind of a sweet medicinal taste. Not too harsh. Palette is fairly long. I wish it was a little sweeter.

2.25,"This one comes in 108 proof and 11 years old from MGP, barrel 030.

So the story is a bunch of people...likely who don't know much about bourbon...bought whiskey and then bottled it while they happened to have an office in a distillery, that they really want us to know is historic...

Gotta love the fake ""history"" with the picture on the back and the ""old"" title to make us think this is something from the past.

Nose - I tend to agree with other reviews, this comes off as a high rye bourbon. A lot of mint, spices, vanilla, and not much else.

Taste - This has to be the most spicy bourbon I've had out of MGP. It's a white bread and caramel malt base with light spices leaning on Christmas and mint notes. 

Medium to light finish, minimal depth. Shockingly little oak or complexity beyond the spices and sweetness. I'd have really expected more out of an 11 year MGP barrel, but it's a single barrel and they can't all be winners. I don't think anyone will dislike this one unless they can't stand spice. I will add in it drinks super easy for 108 and that might be a seller to a lot of people. 

Giving this a 2.25 for being a nicely made bourbon, but without anything really standing out. Overall at 130 bucks, this is an easy and hard pass."

4.0,Nice high rye high proof bourbon. Spice blends nicely with some honey and brown sugar. Very smooth and well aged with nice oak on the nose and palette.
