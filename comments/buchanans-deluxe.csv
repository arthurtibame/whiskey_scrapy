4.0,"11/16.  Similar to JW Black but - longer better finish. More citrusy.  Less malty (more grain), thinner.  JW Black is fuller in the mouth, more malt, but very short finish.  I like this better than JWB and it's cheaper"

1.0,"A local liquor store owner was nice enough to share a sample with me that was left over from a recent Buchanan's tasting.  The initial delivery on this scotch is not too bad, with some sweet fruits, but the palate becomes hopelessly blurred with muddled smoke and cloying, grainy sweetness dominating the finish.  It's light bodied and inexpensive, but there are much better blended scotch values out there (the NAS Grants, for instance, blows this out of the water).  Diageo owns this blend and they do a much better job with a 12 yr old blended scotch with their iconic Johnnie Walker Black.  Not recommended, although I thought the Buchanan's 18 that I also sampled wasn't bad."

1.0,"Feb 2017.  This was recommended to me as a good choice for a new-to-scotch person as well as being a flavorful blended scotch on a budget.  Saw a review that said the longer it stays in your mouth, the more it tastes like caramelized onions and that it is well paired with charred meat or poultry.  That was intriguing so I gave it a try.

Bottom line up front, this one is not for me.  I picked up what I interpreted to be overpowering pipe tobacco on the nose.  I’m not particularly fond of that so perhaps mentally I was already done with this.  The mouth feel was uneventful.  I did pick up the sweetness.  The finish had a little bite.  Never really got the caramelized onions but in its defense I was drinking this neat and without any charred meat.

I labeled this one, “Drink this when ‘regular’ friends visit or when making cocktails.”"

3.75,"Nose: Dark fruit, light smoke, salted caramel, with a hint briney of sea water. 

Taste: More jucie fruits, chocolate, a bit of brine, with a spiced walnut after taste. 

Experience: Looking into a tide pool in the summer. Summers sweetness mixed with salty discovery."

3.0,"Nostalgia is a funny thing. Nearly ten years ago, I was living in Montevideo, Uruguay for a year of volunteer work between undergrad and seminary. My supervisor at the social project had the foreign volunteers over on Christmas Day; being a good uruguayo, he got the grill up and going for an asado extravaganza, and pulled out the Buchanan's. His father in law kept asking me if I wanted ""más hielo"" in my whisky...let's just say he that wasn't only adding ice, and I had a REALLY good Christmas. In South America, this IS scotch. It's the biggest seller. Truthfully, it's not hard to see why - it's balanced, sweet, fruity, easy to drink, and has just enough of a whisp of smoke and salinity to stay interesting. Is it a great whisky? No. It is, however, a pleasant warm
weather blend on the rocks...which makes it a great Southern Hemisphere Christmas dram. Feliz Navidad!"

      6 days later, 3rd dram or so since opening the bottle. Today the smoke is light and only in the finish. Its sweet fruit, spice and toffee in the nose. Sweet and rich tasting."

5.0,"Buchanan's De Luxe 12-Year has a deep golden, clear appearance, with noticeable & noble alcohol legs. The aroma is mild, yet pungent, with wax, peat smoke, a citrus peel. There is, perhaps, also an almond oil aspect. The flavor is of smoky, waxy, peat; orange pith, mild chocolate, barley bread, and a spicy finish. Mouthfeel is medium, and Buchanan's De Luxe 12-Year finishes with a slow, but not sloppy, fade. RJT"

3.0,balanced flavor with sweet and just enough smoke to taste but not to offend the new scotch palate.  sometimes i think i pick up sweet green pepper. very pleasant scotch that i would recommend for a new scotch drinker
3.0,"Appearance: This beautiful blend is khaki gold in color with exceedingly thin and viscous legs.

Nose: The nose at first appears mostly as grain “sparkle,” but with some time to open up notes of salty peat smoke, pine trees, candy honey, flowers, sour green apple and grape, and lemon zest all make appearances in the exciting nose.

Taste: The delicious palate consists of notes of sea salt, peat, orange citrus, fruity candy, honey, dark chocolate,  and campfire smoke.

Finish: There is a short to medium finish that rises up in your throat, then dives but leaves behind an almost BBQ aftertaste in the back.

Thoughts: There's a lot going on, but it's a good balanced blend. I don't mind it one bit but like it more after letting it breathe a while. I would recommend it. Buchanan’s, I can see why you are one of the top selling blended scotches out there. Keep it up! Sláinte!"

3.5,"Cost-effective if you ask me, pricing at just over $30 in Southern California, a blended Scotch, drinks like a single malt, seems confused. I really only ever buy it as a gift for an old friend I enjoy drinking with on occasion late into the night, so this is perfect for that.

We did try it as shots once, and though it is doable, I highly do not recommend it, it is dumb and the burn can choke you worse than Tequila for a new drinker.

Strong smoke presence and pretty juicy, with a bit of pepper on the palate, enjoy as a finger or two."

3.25,"Neat: A huge fusel burn right off the bat. Plenty of caramel, toffee and corn, but they play second fiddle to the alcohol heat. No peat or smoke whatsoever. 

With a droplet: the burn slightly decreases but not by much. The toffee and caramel dilute a bit, but prickly citrus spices come out with a floral quality.

(RECOMMENDED) With a big cube: the vanilla, caramel and toffee bloom. Dried orange peel also pops here. Ashy smoke puffs out with ice as well. It definitely benefits from dilution or a mixer."

Color - light amber
Nose - fruit forward (pear, orange), light peat, hint of caramel hiding
Palate - buttery with smoke, some earthy tones
Finish - faint smoke, lingering of chocolate, a little oily leather on the tail end.

Personally I found water brought more of the Islay character (peat, moss, earth) and neat showcased more of a speyside (fruit, chocolate)"
