4.0,Nice sipping bourbon.  Wish I’d bought a couple bottles
4.25,Vanilla for days. Little oak influence. No spice. Smooth and sweet.
3.5,"The nose is mild with dry wine notes, a subtle spicy oakiness with the faintest hints of caramel and vanilla. On the palate is tastes almost like a fortified wine aged in oak, with caramel and vanilla following behind. The finish is medium and most, and is where the vanilla really comes out as it fades long and nicely ahead of all other flavors. Different and simple, but enjoyable."
