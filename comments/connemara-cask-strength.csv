5.0,One of the smoothest cask strength Irish whiskey's just shy of Writers Tears. The profile is complex and fun with the peat smoke not overbearing. A wonderful new saddle leather quality hums throughout it and is one of a kind in that fashion.

4.25,"Slight peat on the nose, initially fruity on the palate but bam - massive intense smokey finish. Heart warming."
4.0,Some people may not like this because they’re expecting Irish whiskey but it’s more of a Scotch. But if you like a peaty/smoky flavor with a really light body then this is the bottle for you. It also maintains the vanilla notes of a nice Irish whiskey.

4.5,"Peaty and full. Not as peaty as an Islay. Rich and flavorful, worth a taste. I enjoy it!"
2.75,"Not as complex as you'd expect for cask strength and not as peaty as its name suggests, though adding water does bring that out a little more. Not a bad whiskey but not exactly great either. Hints of honey on the nose and first taste has a little heat. Short finish."

4.0,"The regular Connemara is good, if not great, as far as peated whiskies go. The cask strength...now we're talking. An earthy, woody peat smoke dominates, but an appealing vanilla cream helps balance out the smoke. It's a dry malt, too, reminding me more of Cambelltown than Islay in that regard. Worth tracking down!"
