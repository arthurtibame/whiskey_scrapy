3.0,Big nose of sweet paint. Which for those who like scotches such as Laphroig is a good thing. Doesn't benefit from a splash of water. Finishes well but nothing to write home about.

5.0,This is awesome stuff. Worth the $89 I spent on it. Nice nose and I love the layers of flavor. Butterscotch into oak into spice with a touch of sweet. I might have to get a 2nd bottle

4.0,Pleasant brown sugar nose with notes of apple. Sweet flavor with notes of brown sugar with hints of oak. Peppery finish with notes of sweet oak. Flavors linger for about 30 seconds. Thanks TW.

5.0,"Just how I like my American whiskey: Big, savory, and sweet with a heavy dash of barrel notes and a lovely touch of time. This delivers everywhere with vanilla, baked apple, clove, tobacco, brown sugar, leather, caramel, cinnamon, cherry, butter, and a whiff of old books making appearances as that viscous spirit glides along your tongue and lingers. Sumptuous and bold, this was a divine experience."

4.0,"For some people, this is a sensational, first-rate dram.  I wouldn't go quite that far, although it's not unfairly priced at around $80 (and I see it a few places online for closer to $60-65).  The nose is almost hoppy in its herbal, vegetal rye-derived freshness, with some vanilla lending some sweeter notes.  The rye is definitely dominating the blend from the outset.  The palate demonstrates more hybrid characteristics, with an odd tinned pineapple note, but over time the rye again seems to win out and resemble High West Rendezvous Rye.  The finish features barrel char and a great combination of rye spice and bourbon richness."
4.0,"Baking spice and caramel on the nose. Great mix of rye and bourbon (rye first then bourbon), you can discern notes of both. Autumnal notes. Strong flavors but smooth, nothing is out of place. 1/25/18"

4.0,"2017 release:

Nose: sweet and full of depth of spices

Mouth: light, fruit-laced, and the sweet overall feeling of eating fruit with the skin still on. Very interesting indeed. 

Finish: nice and peppery, nearly no burn. Some sharp oak notes finish this one off. 

A solid 4.25/5. $69.99 in Michigan on 3/25/18"

5.0,my next bottle purchase!
3.75,"""• A blend of straight Bourbon and Rye whiskeys aged from 10 to 14 years.
• Straight Rye Whiskey: 95% rye, 5% barley malt from MGP & 53% rye, 37% corn, 10% barley malt from MGP
• Straight Bourbon Whiskey: 75% corn, 21% rye, 4% barley malt from MGP""

It starts strong, with a good aroma (a lot of licorice) and flavor, but after sitting for a bit it loses some of that and can become a bit dull. This is a good solid whiskey, overall, but just costs too much for what it delivers."

3.0,"2.5 stars. Ok. I’m being unfair. 2.8, maybe 3? I like bourbon. I like rye. I don’t like this bourye. Nice in premise and on paper, but application doesn’t please my pallet (and I’m pretty sure it’s still a fully-sourced and then blended product). Medicinal hint on nose - like all High West products. Not very complex bourbon up front. Smooth rye-ish finish. Not worth ANYWHERE NEAR the $80+ they charge (here in MD). Look elsewhere in the (relative) price point (esp Blanton’s, Macallan 12, Angel’s Envy Rye, even Lot 40; Whistlepig Farmstock isn’t fully sourced anymore and is about $100) to put your hard-earned money to use."

5.0,"Part of a flight:
Angel’s Envy Bourbon Port Finish (Batch 59I) at 43.3% ABV
High West Bourye (Batch 17L21) at 46% ABV
Prichard’s Double Barreled at 45% ABV

The winner.  
This stuff just gets better with time and water.  The foundation is a very well-aged 10 year old bourbon.  You get that leathery tobacco, cinnamon powder, and red fruits.  The ryes are even more aged – a blend 12-14 years old.  That takes the young rye edge, which I don’t like, away.  It adds some mint and greenness to the bourbon, and never steals the spotlight.  I also get some wine notes, which emerges in the absence of wine finishing, as far as I can tell.  This is very similar to High West’s bespoke Midwinter.
With water, this opens up to reveal white pepper and dark chocolate in a dynamic, lovely finish that lingers for quite a while.
In Maryland, this tends to be cheaper than in other parts of the country.  I found this on sale for $72, and it’s a steal at that price.
