5.0,"A real treat in a glass,  you want to let this breathe for 15 minutes so the alcohol burns off and the aromas come forward.  Nose is cooking spices and powder chocolate, nutmeg and brown sugar.  Body is light however gives you an oily coat, astringent feel in the sides of your tongue.  The palate is tricky, significant oak forward resulting from the age and variety of barrel, again a variety of spices and deep cherries followed by dark chocolate.  Finish is light and dissipates quickly but leaving you thirsty for more.  This is a hard to find but I recommend jumping on this unique entry for your collection."
5.0,"This is amazing juice , slight spice on finish that gives way to a long chocolate/ gingerbread stout taste that seems to be well balanced .... a unique gem !"

3.5,"You might get some ginger, nutmeg, and shortbread on the nose, but it's not too obvious. I'm looking for gingerbread and cocoa notes since that's what the label says, but if I hadn't known not sure it would jump out at me. Slight citrus and wood. It's a pleasant nose. On the palate, its smooth, some creamy notes, cinnamon, and finishes with cacao nibs. Again, I seem to get some gingerbread notes, but that may be the power of suggestion. Regardless, it's a good bourbon, a classic profile with some fall spices. I think it would have been noticeably better at 100 proof, but it's still good. Drinkable, very. 2/5/20."

4.5,This is my second favorite out of the Abraham Bowman series that I’ve tasted (after the Sweet XVI). Very smooth with just the right spice.
