3.5,"Nose: Very pretty floral aromas with fresh, lifted notes. Fruity and sprightly. A little trace of something herbal - elderflower? Chamomile? There's a little honeyed note too. Caramel sweets and Nuttall's Curiously Strong Mints (hah! I bet I'm the only one here to remember those!). What a nice nose. Adding a dash of water settles the sweetness and allows the cereal aromas to come forward.

Palate: Sweet, spicy and robust on the arrival with a little heat. The development slows down and focuses on cereal flavours and honey. Cloves, cinnamon and something briny I can't quite identify. Interesting. Good texture. With water it all becomes very integrated and gentle - just a long flow of herbal and ultra mild spice.

Finish: Long. Longer than expected, and in a good way. The palate slowly fades away leaving a pleasantly re-emerging aftertaste of minty rye. Water adds a drying note to the finish.

Lovely fragrant nose. So sweet and delicate. What a nice dram. Good neat, good with water, I'd imagine it's good with any sort of mixer as well. Great artisan stuff - I could drink this all day.

Thanks to @Soba45 and @PBMichiganWolverine for the tasting sample

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
4.75,A very nice and smooth rye with a wonderful aftertastes.
3.25,"Definitely another interesting rye profile. I'm thinking perhaps my palate is a bit dazed, stuffed and confused switching between mezcals, grappas, bourbons ryes and whiskies as other than a few great mezcals it hasn't been a great ride tonight. I did a whiskey calibration and that didn't taste quite right either, perhaps .25 lower than usual. Taking that into account I'm in alignment with @Richard-ModernDrinking score around the 3.25 mark. Thanks @PBMichiganWolverine for the sample. I think I've worked my way through all your great presents! I'd say in order of favourites: Laphroaig 2013 Portwood, Octomore 10, 50 year boutique blend, Del Maguey Arroqueno, Auchentoshan 21 CS, Laphroaig Cairdeas Triple Wood, Balcones French Oak, Old Grand Dad, Little Book Chpt 3, Heavens Door, New Southern Revival, Rebel Yell 10. Thanks once again for taking the time and effort to share some great drams its been an amazing journey! I'm sad I can't do a swap but I'm going to save samples of my top drams for you so one day when I make it back to NY or you make it over for a Dramfest 2022 in NZ . I can pay back the generosity. PS if we meet up after 2027 I'll have 1971 Mortlach and 1966 Port samples with your name on plus a number of other great drams I'll crack open just before my liver fails at the tender age of 50 years and 1 day :-) PSS. I may have to leave them to you in my will if I die sooner :-)"

3.5,"You know it's a good week when you receive a sample box from the great @PBMichiganWolverine! As always I am grateful to have an opportunity to try a unique Whiskey that has yet to make it out to AZ! 

So what do we know about this one? 

It's a true grain to bottle Distillery out of South Carolina

Mashbill is 75% rye, 20% white corn and 5% malted barely. 

All grains are sourced locally and milled on site

It's aged for 12 months in 15g Virgin Charred Oak Barrels and then finished in 59g Charred Oak Barrels for an undisclosed period of time

It's bottled at 45% ABV and it lightly charcoal filtered

On to the tasting! It's really soft and light upon entry with honey and cinnamon. Mid palette add more spices like clove with some lovely toasted oak and a slight hint of dill. Finish is a decent length with some pepper, cinnamon and more honey. 

All in all this is a really nice drop and definitely a unique tasting Rye! $60 is maybe a bit steep for what you get but it's definitely something I would not mind owning a bottle of. 

Cheers @PBMichiganWolverine for the sample and cheers all!"
3.25,"Very interesting contribution by @PBMichiganWolverine to our tasting meet-up. The nose is soft for a rye and almost corn like. More typically rye in the mouth, crisp and clean upfront, but its youth shows in the sharper finish. Still, a distillery to keep an eye on."
4.0,"Following in the footsteps of its older cousin Michter’s 10 yr rye, we had this as well in yesterday’s tasting at @Richard-ModernDrinking ‘s .   I was particularly taken by these guys from South Carolina.  They run a full grain to bottle operation, but go one step above and beyond.  They grow almost extinct rare heirloom grain, harvest it, and distill it.  This one here uses the now rare and discontinued Abruzzi rye.  I’ve a sweet spot for grain to glass distillers, but am truly impressed when they grow their own, not to mention rare or extinct grains!

So, this is young —about 2 yr, if I’m not mistaken.  Despite its youth, the aromas are soft and buttery.   Flavor is hot at first, like biting a piece of cinnamon, but then cools down in a layer of mint and a funky rye taste.  

I’m impressed enough to see where a few more years take these guys.  With craft distilleries, you never know if it’ll be good or a bust, but this was pretty damn good.  Good enough to be a buyer again, especially after they age a bit more."
