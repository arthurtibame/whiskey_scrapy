4.25,"My first time trying Balcones and I am impressed this is an excellent American single malt- not too heavy, not too much spice, light fruitiness to balance then finished well!"
4.0,"Nose: heavy malt, slight lemongrass, sweet raw sugar, dry apple, apricots, light floral rose petal, maple

Taste: heavy oak, pancakes with maple syrup and raspberries, chocolate, lemon / citrus.

Water brings out the herbal nature of sage and parsley. Dark fruit like apricot and raspberries. Really dry. Lemon and sweetness gets buried but is there. Very spicy flavor of pepper and chilies.

Not for the faint of heart. The ABV is even more than some Stagg jrs."
