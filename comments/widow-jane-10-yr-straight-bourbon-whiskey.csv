4.75,"Caramel and sweet forward, clean finish with just enough burn to remind you that this is something that you should appreciate. I don't have the palate to say that the mineral water is what gives this such appeal to me (I grew up in South Jersey drinking hard water with a high iron content), but I will never turn this down.

Tasted neat. Only neat. I would drink it with a straw if I wouldn't go through it too quickly."
4.25,Smooth
4.0,"Lots of oak, tons of spice and cinnamon, a hint of cherry and vanilla. I really enjoy the amount of oak I’m getting in this."
4.25,"Nose: stone fruits, honey and spice. 
Taste: sweet, very well rounded, cocoa, baking spices, medium long finish. 

Wife bought it for me for Valentine’s Day and I think she found a gem. Forget the MGP critics, this is a very fine bourbon."
3.5,"Very fruity nose; berries, peach, possibly a bit of tropical fruit like kiwi and banana, fresh tomato, browned butter, burnt sugar, vanilla, delicately floral. The flavor is very subtle, delicate; hay, caramel, red ground pepper. Peppery finish, slightly floral once again, a long burn."

3.75,Good drinking bourbon. Very smooth. Lacks the character of some of your higher end bourbons.
4.0,Lacking much fragrance it is surprisingly smooth. Good drinking bourbon but lacks some of the character top bourbons have.
2.0,How is this now 100 proof
4.5,"Back to NY. My last NY whiskey review was over ago. That was of the Hudson Baby Bourbon. Was not a fan by any means. Let's see if the Empire state can redeem itself with this one.

Nose: Classic bourbon notes. Caramel and vanilla. Apple and black cherry. Honey and butterscotch. A touch of leather, barrel char, and oak. Maple and pecan. It's rich and vibrant, and is an exemplary classic bourbon nose. Good start.

Palate: Gala apple and brown sugar out of the gate. More caramel, vanilla, and butterscotch, now accompanied by toffee. In the background I still get black cherry, with just a hint of leather. Orange peel and ginger become prominent with time.

Finish: Long, especially for 45.5%. Cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. Finally, a bit of a kick. Until now it's been perfectly easy-going. Some barrel char and oak. There's also a bit of brown sugar sweetness before baking spices and ginger carry this one to its long-drawn conclusion.

New York, you are redeemed. Excellent bourbon. As I said before, it's an exemplary classic bourbon. Both in terms of notes and quality. There's also something unique about it. The folks at Widow Jane would tell you it's a product of their limestone mineral water. I'm in no position to comment, but I'll just throw it out there: there's something special going on here.

Highly recommend this one. The palate is a slight letdown in comparison to the superb nose and finish. Just a half step behind. On the other hand, it boasts a 10-year age statement, repsectable proof, and a unique spin on what is, for the most part, a quintessential bourbon profile. Well done, Widow Jane."

Oh my. This is warm, sweet, & easy on the pallet. Very delicate. My wife who is not a brown liquor fan but knows good stuff from bad pretty damn quick, immediately approved. Super approachable! 

There's good measure of vanilla and almond, bit'o honey candy and a slight touch of ginger and white pepper on the finish. 

Immensely enjoyable!"
