3.0,A little hot. Not too much rum to speak of.  Sweet with a hint of orange. More Sweetness in the form of vanilla on the finish.

4.0,"Golden cask holds a special place in my heart because it was the first scotch I’ve ever had. I remember attempting to savor the liquor for the first time as opposed to downing it, and being met with an incisive bite. Determined, my friends and I continued to try our palate. Eventually, I began to discern notes of chocolate...fruits...wood? It was a whole new world; I had no intention of leaving after seeing what delicacies awaited discovery. 

This scotch is riddled with honey, florals, tropical fruits, apples, walnuts, tons of toffee, nougat, vanilla, cocoa, rum, and oak. Very sweet, but in the most appropriate and delicious way possible. A shame it was limited release."
