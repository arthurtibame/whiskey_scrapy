4.0,"香甜的雪莉桶帶來的瓜類水果、青蘋果的香氣，酒體輕盈，入口後香氣集中在上顎，雪莉特性的香氣細細長流，尾韻有些微的波本香氣。口腔香氣長存卻不殘留 。

4.0,"Finally got my hands on something really really nice and I’m astonished with the way the Mortlach 12 impressed me.
The aroma basis is classic sweet and warm with toffee, butterscotch, rich caramel and probably a drop of a sweet musk. It also has a rather unusual notes of toasted chestnuts, citron sweets, subtle cigar smoke (like in perfume) and even pine needles, what makes the smell a little bitter. 
The taste is a logical follow-up to the aroma as it’s powerful, warm, spicy and it’s like saturated with the sweetness of raisins, dried apricots, caramel, nuts, butterscotch and it reveals some oriental delights in the background. It just knocked me down for a few seconds so I wouldn’t probably call this whisky smooth. Hence it leaves me in a position where it’s hard to gauge the balance of the whisky as it has this overwhelming sweet power though it delivers some bitter notes in the end.
Finish is really bitter and hart-hitting.
The aftertaste lingers for a while with that bitter sweet flavor of a honey mixed with a tar. And, well, caramel. Sorry for not mentioning it once again.
It has its own style and this special heavily sweet mood which is might be more typical to armagnacs. Does it live up to its name of “The Beast of Dufftown”? I doubt it not."

5.0,"a dry spicy finish, lingers longer than many. not as rich and fruity as something kept longer in Oloroso casks, but still a bold flavour"
3.75,"Great color, good nose, brine after taste."
4.0,"I have been drinking several whiskeys tonight - Auchentoshan 3 Wood, Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie, Glenlivet, and finally Mortlach.  I was surprised at the intensity of smokiness found in Mortlach, it's certainly not Islay, but it was quite a puff of smoke on the first sip.  It had a vegetal, horseradish flavor that I most often get from various species of Ardbeg.  The Distiller reviewer mentions sulfur - there is something too that, though I don't think I could have come up with that description myself.  This whiskey has a full body too it - it has a nice burn on the tongue, but it's not exactly black pepper - it's more like sulfur and horseradish.  There is a bit of sweetness in the finish but it's difficult to place, it's like sherry mixed with charcoal - it's earthy.  Something makes me think of limestone.  There is a lot going on here - the balance is a bit off, but it's enjoyable.  A few more years on this to let the flavors marry together more and it could be truly sublime."

3.0,"I go back and forth on this whisky. I can pick up the taste described at ""meaty"". I sometimes find this note pleasing, other times off-putting. If you're looking for something interesting that won't break the bank I'd recommend it. In my area it's cheaper than a lot of entry level malts, and it defiantly isn't a boring whisky. However, if you are new to drinking Scottish whisky, I'd recommend sticking to the classics. Leave this to a more trained palate."

3.75,Bought it because I remembered a Mortlach from the 70s my grandfather had but this was quite different.  An excellent smooth whiskey probably good as a gift to the uninitiated (don’t want to scare anyone off at first go).  Not a value buy - lotsa marketing to pay for.

3.0,"Starts off smooth and tasty, but leaves a sharp aftertaste."
3.5,"Picked up a bottle of this unexpectedly, looking for an unpeated Speyside or Highland. The nose is fruity and floral, and I smell grilled pineapple, citron zest, and dried cranberry. Caramel is also prominent. The palate is luxe: a bold, rich, spicy, and robust Speyside. I taste saltwater taffy and shortbread (god, I love shortbread), candied lemon peel and more grilled pineapple. The barrel-spice bourbon influence is discernible but plays well with the fruit-driven, more rounded sherry notes. As far as quality and character, it reminds me of the Glenrothes 1998, though it’s less sticky-sweet. In terms of boldness, I’m reminded of the Balvenie Tun series. The finish is consistent with this scotch’s other facets, and lives up to its nickname, “the Beast of Dufftown.” The finish is the only place that peat plays a prominent role, and in this case it is pleasantly mossy. Heather lingers in the dried glass. At $44 per bottle, I’d be hard pressed to find something as good as “the Wee Witchie.”"

4.0,"Хорошо, но не исключительно"
4.0,"The smell is initially a little closed, but with patience it reveals a very sherried nose: plum, ripe banana, pear, candied orange, a touch of cinnamon. Honey. Waxy consistency with light alcoholic puncture. On the length, a substantial woody presence is perceived.
The palate is warm and vinous, fruity with spicy touches, quite linear. Butter biscuits, honey, vanilla, ripe peach, hazelnuts, cinnamon and sultanas. Pinch of lemon. All very peaceful and well kneaded.
Medium long finish, of wood, dried fruit, malt.
Without infamy and without praise, a well-done homework that does not shine in any aspect, given the reasonable overall cost it is acceptable, had been priced as in the early days it would have been to be completely discarded."
