3.25,"I am doing a side-by-side comparison of a few Irish mid-shelf whiskies. All are being poured neat. First up is Clontarf. Apparently it is 15% pot still and 85% grain (corn), is charcoal filtered, and aged in first fill bourbon barrels. Distiller rates it at 80, and whiskeyreviewer gives it a C+. I give it a C. It is smooth and heavy on vanilla, but is rather non-descript. It doesn't taste ""Irish,"" but could pass for an average Canadian or American blend with no rye in the mash bill. I purchased a bottle of this three years ago and could not remember exactly what I thought of it; so, I decided to try it again. I have found it not to be memorable again. It's not bad, and probably would be a good mixer; but it simply is not a great sipper for me."

Neat - more burn and spice than rocks, spice dominates, hint of apple"

3.0,Very light. Not bad.
2.0,"Lately I've been finding that most bottom shelf Irish whiskies taste the same.  At $20 though I'd take it over the rest.  This one is easily drinkable, yet loses its edge as it opens up over time, and totally falls apart on the finish.  Slight spice, certainly vanilla sweetness.  A touch of lemon...and maybe banana.  I dunno...maybe I'm just bananas myself."

3.0,Mellow and a little on the sweet side. Very drinkable in a casual sort of way.
5.0,"I my opinion, this is the go to bottom shelf whiskey of any style, it is a little in your face, but once you get past it makes you want to drink the whole thing, particularly on a cold March day."

Body- Bright with vanilla notes giving way to a bit of ginger and citrus.
Finish- Short with lemon

Note- Simple but not unpleasant. Beat Tullamore in our blind taste test."

3.0,"I bought this because it was cheap when I was underemployed , but enjoyed it and found it more complex than Jameson's. This is very easy to drink...perhaps too easy?
  Update: I had some more recently when deciding what to buy for St. Patty's, and noticed corn sweetness similar to Bourbon... the Clontarf website mentions ""maize"" in addition to malted barley... Which is unusual for an Irish whiskey. Between maize in the mash and aging in ex-Bourbon barrels, I think this might be a good Irish blend for Bourbon drinkers."

5.0,Vanilla bouquet with subtle licorice notes. A new favorite - guess I'll have to go to Ireland to pick some up!
2.0,"Very light on the pallet. Vanilla, carmal and a little sweetness. After taste just a little salt. I think it's better neat  then on the rocks.  Taking this one for a second run. I'm definitely getting salted caramel on the front end crisp finish that doesn't linger. It's such a light whiskey I really had to search for the flavors."
4.0,"Open question about this whiskey:
If the mash bill is 15% pot still with the remainder corn, does that make it a “single grain” whiskey? The term has become a popular marketing label lately, and this offering has been around for much longer; possibly they could re-label if so.
Thanks for any helpful answers.

3.75,Tasted this blind and compared it close to green spot and writers tears then upon reveal the price was half which is awesome ! Orchard fruit rich smooth and delicious 😋 easily my fave Irish whiskey rather any whiskey at the $30-40 mark I know some may knock that it isn’t all pot still and some corn but it is aged 4 years rather than 3 in this price range but it also makes it unique and flavourful so damn the process :)

3.0,"This is a high 3, nearly a 4, as my dram of Clontarf was a faithful companion to my Christmas Eve sermon writing here at my local Irish pub. It ticks all the Irish whiskey boxes - honey sweetness, a bit of clovers floral notes, some spice, a little apple compote, slightly bitter green notes from the unmalted barley, and a bready chassis that reminded me of waffles more than bread. Not bad, but also not likely to become my go-to Irish whiskey, either."

3.75,caramel notes. Slightly Smokey but smooth finish
3.25,Aroma is light just like its coloring.  Smooth taste but has a distinct peat-like taste.  Not bad as a supper but there are better options out there.
2.75,"Clontarf is a nice and full consistent blended whiskey. In order to generalize its taste, one is in a right to say that Clontarf is something between Tullamore DEW and Bushmills (if we take both in their original versions), though it has some mild distinct notes and its own certain elegant style (probably due to its low occurrence).
The aroma is vibrant, nicely formed, though it lacks this noble vibe, however the balance is strictly considerable. It has some simple grain, malt and alcohol notes, a little bit of citrus, slight honey and vanilla hints along with some oaten or hay-ish tone.
The palate is a bit less pronounced. Vanilla, some nutty flavors, spices, unripe apricots, much of a citrus or, to be more precise, a citrus peel, and the alcohol is slightly marked here again.
The finish is lightly sweet and spiced. The aftertaste is about the burnt wood, honey and also the bitter herbals."
