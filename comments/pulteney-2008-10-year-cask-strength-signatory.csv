3.5,"Nose: very heavy malt must, pear, Fuji apple. Salted toffee. Vanilla, cranberry, caramel.

Taste: freshly baked bread. Salt. Pear. Vanilla custard. Caramelized apples. Lemon, cardamom. Hay. Spicy gingerbread cookies. Black pepper. Light generic floral notes. Finish is long with very sweet powdered sugar notes.

Water: more malt funk and sweetness on the nose. Taste is more sharp citrus such as grapefruit and lime. Second round of water really brings out the black pepper and malt funk again. More of a Jura style pancake malt. Brings out the sweeter custard notes then fades quickly to bitter lime and black pepper. 

This was the neck pour so another review is due eventually."
