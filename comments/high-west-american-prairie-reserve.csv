4.0,"Not much of a bourbon drinker, but I found this to be very smooth. Sweet, yet not as syrupy as Jack Daniels. It does finish quick and clean. Because I find that it doesn't linger as long on the tongue as others, the time between sips is shorter."
3.0,Has a good kick

3.0,A bit too expensive for what it is (in Canada). Drink with a dash of water to get full taste
3.0,This was a very good bourbon style whiskey. A little hotter than it needed to be. But a dash of water fixed that.

4.0,"Tasted 12/17/2014 :  Corn sweetness backed with the spicey rye-ness when nosing.  A nice, creamy, full palate. Finishes quickly leaving black pepper spice with mild tongue burn.  The creamy body, mild spice and sweetness on the nose all combine to make a very enjoyable dram.  Good neat or a splash. Rather enjoyed the sugar and spice."

3.0,Not tremendously flavorful but certainly a subtle sweetness with some fruit and spice.
3.0,"High West American Prairie Reserve isn't a bad whiskey--it's pretty good, actually. It's just hurt by the fact that it's more expensive than it should be. To wit: one of its component whiskeys comes from Four Roses, but I can buy a bottle of Four Roses Single Barrel for $10-15 less locally. And in terms of flavours, this is a blend whose lineage is unmistakeably a mix of LDI and Four Roses: the gin-y, herbal, metholated, faintly nutty character of LDI whiskey with the cherry cola and plums of Four Roses. And yet it tastes strangely younger than its age--surprisingly green and hot. Flavours here of clove, caraway, mint, vanilla, fruit, baking spice. Chocolate, cinnamon, some orange peel. A lot of sweetness with a spice backbone on the taste. Good whiskey, and I suppose you can feel good about some of the proceeds going to charity, but I really would just rather pay less for the superior tasting, higher ABV Four Roses Single Barrel."

4.0,"Not my favorite outing from high west but as usual, much better than most efforts. Sipping neat it has an interesting finish. Not the complexity I come to expect from Dave and team. This would be a perfect whiskey for cocktails."
null,I love this whiskey in an old fashion. Just the right amount of spice. I've been meaning to get a bottle for the house.

3.0,"Another bourbon where I'm completely off the Distiller notes -- I wonder if I was having a weird taste day yesterday.  The nose almost seems sherried to me, as the strongest scents I got were raisins, dates, and figs.  Relative to the average bourbon, Prairie Reserve has a spicier nose.  The palate also struck me as spicier than average (and after looking it up online, I've seen some sites reporting that one of the bourbons in the mix is Four Roses, which would make sense given that distillery's high-rye mashbills).  The classic bourbon flavors are also there, along with a bit of Cherry Coca Cola.  The finish, consistent with the palate and nose, is peppery; that sherry sensation returns, and then it mellows out to an herbal and slightly bitter grassiness.  Since the flavor profile hits so many of the same spice notes as Four Roses, and the superlative Four Roses Single Barrel is around the same price, I'd recommend just going straight to the source."

Not a bad dram, but I’m unlikely to pull a muscle seeking it out. 3 solid stars."
