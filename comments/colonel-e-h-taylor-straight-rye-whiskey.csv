3.0,Good. But missing something I can't put my finger on.
4.0,Baking spice on the nose and heavier baking spice on the palate. Drinks more like a bourbon than a rye...love it!

3.0,Spicy good flavor. Dark chocolate with a slow burn that last going down. Drank neat will need to try with a cube of ice possibly. Hint of fruit on the nose

Buttery and complex, likely due to the aging, surprisingly, almost as if it had a high corn content, despite the fact that it has 0% corn in it (the rest is just Barley)."

5.0,"I'm what you might call a bit of a whiskey stalker. I make the rounds pretty regularly at the liquor stores around me; Binny's dominates the Chicagoland market, but each location has its own distinct personality, and you never know what the store manager will pick up. I was making my monthly reconnaissance of the location nearest the church yesterday, and I spied the unmistakable tall, yellow-ish khaki canister that Colonel EH Taylor bottlings come to the shelf in. I went to investigate further. There were TWO separate EH Taylors...but Binny's website only lists the standard bourbon bottling. Intrigued, I realized that one was in the rye section...and suddenly, recon shifted into search-and-rescue, as there was no way I was leaving a bottle of this lonely on the shelf or, worse, in the hands of someone incapable of appreciating its glory. I babied this bottle - kept it with me in the AC at church so it didn't bake in the car, the whole nine yards. And, sweet mother of God, it was worth the hassle. This is not your normal rye, from the mashbill on. There is no corn or wheat to be found here; the only other grain in the mash bill is malted barley. Not surprisingly, there is a certain scotchiness to the dram - while the new oak barrels give plenty of caramel and vanilla notes, there is a rich, dark undercurrent of dried figs and plums, a nuttiness, and  a fudgy chocolate from the malt. The rye contributes the spice and dramatic punch you'd expect, but the dill and vegetal notes have all aged away, leaving Christmas spices and cayenne pepper. The finish is long and luscious. I have no idea how the Binny's in this little suburb came to possess four bottles of this treasure of a rye, but my whole seminary education and four years in this parish may have all been worth it just to find this bottle. Really wonderful stuff."

Has a lot of the same character as its brothers in the bourbon line, but has some fantastic spicy and dill qualities.  A must try if you're a rye fan.

On par with Sazerac overall. 

Amazing nose of caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, butter. 

The mouth hits you with so much spice. It’s really something. Not unpleasant at all, very nice feeling overall. 

The finish is shorter than I usually like, but doesn’t have any unpleasant flavors anywhere. 

This is my personal favorite for Rye. The overall taste is like drinking a well-spiced cookie. Smooth, buttery, spices everywhere. 

If you can find this for $80 or less, it’s worth every penny."

3.0,"Nose - Dry rye, cinnamon, oak planks, hay, dried herbs, dry leather.

Taste - Spicy cinnamon, sweet vanilla caramel, black pepper spice/heat, dry sweet mint, light oaky bitterness.

Finish - Lingering rye peppery spice bite, oaky vanilla sweet, light dry herbs.

Score - 70/100

Final Thoughts - This one surprised me a bit in that the nose was quite muted even after letting it air out a bit in the glass. It sort of smelled like it was a bit overoaked but the palate demonstrated that it wasn't. It had a very ""dry"" feel to it overall in both the nose and palate like I was somehow drinking a liquid version of dried oak, rye, and herbs. Maybe I got a bad bottle? Maybe it needs a bit more air time? Regardless I'm glad I got to try this bottle, but I don't think I'll be picking up another as I think Rittenhouse Bonded is significantly better than this and at half the price too.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another"

This Rye taste different then all the other ryes out there. It seems to be more mellow/toned down on the mint/menthol taste than the others. FYI I just finished a pour of Old Fitzgerald 11 year BIB before tasting EHTR. I’m thinking I like this better than my favorite rye Peerless Rye."

The finish is long and features leather, oak and another rye swell. Impressive viscosity for the proof. It's oily. Well played E.H. Taylor. Very Nice.

To me, a lot of ryes have a briny, pickle juice flavor as the dominant taste (Sazerac included), but this guy has an aged-wood nose and a corresponding sawdust taste punching through the body. Honestly, it’s growing on me over time in a way that most ryes don’t. It’s unique in that way. There’s a mild citrus flavor on the body too, and that carries through to the finish. And this may be the power of suggestion, but I think I can taste the E.H. Taylor influence. Over time I’ve come to taste a hint of the green apple flavor that is characteristic to small batch. Not bad, and I think I prefer this to most ryes. However, for the price point, I can think of dozens of whiskeys and whiskies I’d rather have in my collection. Probably won’t be a permanent member on my shelf."

Experience: meeting an old friend after a few years. Everything you expect is there but some of their personality has mellowed out while others they've doubled down on. 

After the high praise this rye received I was expecting something unique, it isnt. it is a lot like cheaper more accessible ryes, however some parts are deeper, while others like the ""ryeness"" are mellowed. It feels like a rye that is trying to be an old bourbon. A good choice if moving from bourbon to rye for sure."

3.75,Neat.   Rye with very little sweetness.  I get licorice and mint on the nose.  Nice creamy mouth feel.  I’m having issues getting passed the licorice.  It gives way to pepper flavors.  A rye whiskey without the sweet notes is disconcerting to me tonight.
4.0,Better than expected. Spicy on the front end but a nice pleasant finish
3.75,Very spicy rye here. But I like it. It’s not my favorite rye but surprisingly easy to sip considering it’s Abv.

3.25,"I received a 5 sample blind tasting challenge from @PBMichiganWolverine and this straight rye from E.H. Taylor was one of them. I only had 1 ounce to work with so I used half for the challenge and saved half for a review. This is a BiB rye that contains no corn, bottled at 50% ABV, natural color of a dark amber. I don’t know if it is chill filtered but I suspect that it is. 

The nose is sticky sweet and very confectionary/fruity. Nothing like any rye I’ve had before in that there is none of the rye grain/spice profile that is typical of a rye whiskey. Blackberry jam, grape jelly, blueberry pie filling and, oddly enough, donut glaze. Some wood spice starts to show after some time. This noses more like a quality blackberry brandy (if such a thing exists) than a rye. After more time the rye starts to come through, but in very small quantities. There is also some mint, plums and possibly fennel. 

Lots of spices on the palate, both wood and rye. Not intense or hot spices but the flavors are there. Light oak, blackberries, blackberry brandy. Cinnamon, clove and barrel char. A bit of an alcohol bite but not bad. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is dry and mouth coating. 
The finish is medium length with blackberries, wood and rye spice. 

During the blind tasting I really disliked this rye, but that very well could have been due to the fact that I was trying 4 others with it and you can never completely clear your palate between each one. I really believed it was a blackberry brandy, and with the lack of rye spice/flavor, and the abundance of berries I think I was justified to think that way. This goes for $70 locally and I would never pay that much, probably wouldn’t buy it at any price honestly. Sampled on its own it’s much better than it was during the challenge, but still not that great. 3.25 and a thanks to Pranay for the sample. 
Cheers"

4.0,"Several months after opening and I rarely taste a whiskey that tastes exactly as when I opened it. And it’s a good thing. 

Nose: approachable, sweet and light, some fruits, a little earth, a little malt

Palate: very bright with cinnamon and for a rye it isn’t all that spicy 

Finish: long finish but balanced and smooth for a rye and my taste. 

This is an approachable whiskey that rye newbies should try to get an easy introduction to the standard. Add a little water and it reminds me of Tullamore DEW. Good balance of sweet and spicy.  

It’s definitely overpriced in an age of more aged ryes hitting the market (thinking specifically of Old Forester). But if you find it at MSRP it’s worth a buy."

4.75,"Nose (4.25):  Buttered toasty rye, ethanol but not overwhelming, and cereal bar.  A really welcoming nose.

Palate:  (4.75)  Alot going in this glass, and for the most part it is all good.  That buttery rye comes through but now there is some peppery notes, almost like chili peppers and chocolate.  What really surprised me is that it is not all spice and rye.  Nice red ripe fruits here.  The mouthfeel is thicker and coating.  This one is a flavor bomb.  Only reason I didnt go full on five is that at some points the notes were a bit sensory overload for me.  That saying, hard to knock something that might just be my own palate preferences vs. complexity.

Finish: (5.0)  Finish for days.  Think warm bakery spices and redhot candies.  As I am writing this review the finish is still playing out.  It is warming like stepping in from the cold to a nice fire.

Overall:  Loved it!  Reminds me alot of my favorite, Michter's Toasted Barrel Rye, but with a spicier edge.  Thanks to @dubz480 for suggesting this to be a buy."

2.75,"Nose: Sweet dark sugars, light vanilla, grassy herbal notes coming through a lot, black pepper, and dill.

Flavor: More herbal sweet notes, a little spicy but not as much as I'd expect or prefer.  Cherry and fig in the background.

Finish:  Medium length with some oak and some spice.

Overall this was kind of boring.  I prefer my rye sweet and spicy and this was more herbal and grassy than I'd like.  Not bad but nothing I'd seek out to try again.  I'm kind of disappointed as I like the EH Taylor Bourbon series quite a bit."

3.0,"Surprised how smooth this is for a rye as I’m used to Ryes that bring big spicy flavor, and this brings a whole different approach.  There is definitely a lot of similarities between EHT Small Batch and this with Raisins.  The nose is mild for a rye, with raisins, cinnamon, and dark fruits.  The palate is really easy going for a rye, not too much heat or spice and is on the sweeter side.  The finish is almost non-existant.  For the price, I expected a lot more.  I like ryes with some boldness to them, and it’s just not here.  Might be a good rye for someone just getting into it, but I’d never pay $70 for that.  Low rating on this one...6.1/10"

4.75,A great rye.
4.75,Vanilla... egg nog spices on nose. Peppery finish. This is amazing rye.  Definitely better on 2nd tasting.
4.5,"For my 100th review milestone I've decided...

...to do nothing out of the ordinary. I simply picked the least full open bottle in my collection which happened to be this Col. EH Taylor Rye.

 It's priced on par with the Single Barrel bourbon, as opposed to the Small Batch, despite it being a (presumably) small batch rye. Considering it's roughly double the price of ryes I've previously owned, I'm hoping for a bit of extra oomph on this one. I love the EH Taylor bourbons, so here's to hoping the rye follows that trend.

Nose: Baking spices, baking spices, baking spices. Clove, nutmeg, and black pepper.  Woody, not just oak but also plywood. Big-time sawdust note. Some orange and some leather, with a tinge of caramel and vanilla. Relatively light at 100 proof, but still enjoyable.

Palate: Spicy and oaky. Rye bread, and more of the clove, nutmeg, and black pepper, now accompanied by cinnamon. The vanilla and orange are now much more prominent, along with some nutty notes. Leather and caramel are an afterthought. More of a pine note than the classic rye note of dill. Interesting. It's complex and succeeds in diverging from the traditional rye profile, possibly due to an absence of corn in the mash bill.

Finish: Best part of the whiskey. Immediately I get the classic BT black cherry. It's instantly replaced with black tea and dill. This is followed by a burst of oak, and then a flurry of baking spice notes. The nutmeg, clove, black pepper, cinnamon continue to roll in as waves of flavor. Somewhere a between moderate and long finish. And right before it's all over, I get just a hint of pistachio and vanilla. I'm left with the sensation of having had a cup of black tea. Great finish.

And there you have, folks. At $80, I'll admit this is not the greatest bang for your buck. But it's also worth the price of admission. It's balanced, complex, and deviates from every other rye I've had to date--in a good way. It's completely different from its Buffalo Trace rye counterpart in Sazerac. Off of memory, it's the better of the two.

Good from nose to palate and concludes with a kick-ass finish. Respectable proof, interesting mash-bill (I forget the percentages but it's only rye and malted barley). I'd say its worthy of its place in the lauded E.H. Taylor line. A high mark and a solid recommendation from me.

Special thanks to everyone who has taken the time to check out these reviews! I appreciate the positivity and insight of the community here on Distiller. Here's to 100 and counting! Cheers!"

3.75,"Nose: A surprisingly fruity nose opens up into a moderate amount of spicy rye, but none of that caraway that I dread in ryes.  A bit of earthy tobacco and pine sits back a ways while light honey sweetens up the front. For a 100 proof, there's next to no ethanol burn.  It's hard to pinpoint the fruity character - almost fruitcake-like I'd say.  Something like a bitter, spicy chocolate back there as well.

Palate:  Sweet and thick on the tongue, without any real heat. Load of cinnamon, oak, and rye spice! Old leather and sweet honey come in after the first spice kick.

Finish:  Medium length and slightly dry.  That leather, tobacco, earthy sweetness dominates with subtle herbs flickering one now and then.

Water turns the nose into an explosion of tropical fruits, heavily oiled leather, barrel char, and deep pit fruits!  The liquid thins out a bit and loses much of it's sweetness and gets actually rather dull.  The Finish is a bit spicier, with sweet molasses note.

Conclusion:  I almost exclusively hate ryes.  If I even get a hint of that characteristic caraway/dill note my stomach turns and I usually don't end up finish the glass.  This however, is a great whiskey, none of that caraway nausea, just spicy, resinous fruit syrup.  If I could find more ryes like this, it might change my mind about the category as a whole."

3.5,"Not the best value in the whiskey world, but if you like punchy, hot ryes, this might fit your needs. Especially after a splash of water.

The best part of this pour is the nose. I get sweet cashew and milk chocolate (almost reminds me of a Pay Day), surrounded by subtle rye notes. Medium weight and slick on entry, a sip delivers soft cashew notes that quickly erupt into rye spice and grainy heat that dominates. Eventually the heat and spice fade to a medium length, warm hug, with barrel char, cinnamon, and anise.

Adding water brings down the ""hot"" nature of the pour, but also dilutes the concentration of the pleasant sweeter notes. Overall, not a bad pour, but at the price point and with the pedigree, I expected more."

4.25,"Being a fan of EH Taylor Small Batch and Single Barrel, I’ve been on the lookout for this one. Excited to see how this different mashbill compares to the others in the lineup.

The nose has rye spice, but not over dominating, pear, light baking spices and bread, little bit of oak, vanilla, and light dusted chocolates.

The palate has an oily mouthfeel with rye spice, vanilla, oak, baking spices and some pears.

The finish is long and has a nice lingering fo vanilla and rye.

This is a very pleasant rye. It doesn’t kick you in the face with overbearing rye spice, but you know it’s there. Fairly easy to drink and somehow still manages to have similar characteristics of the standard EH Taylor offering, even though this is a different mashbill."

3.25,"This is very fruit-forward. Some sort of odd rice vinegar comes through, making the fruit taste a little pickled, but that's actually pretty nice. It's about as rich as Pikesville 6, but is a bit more complex and has a bit more alcohol flavor to it (the latter characteristic being disappointing since this is actually lower proof). There are cereal notes with some mint and almonds or maybe marzipan hanging out at the beginning. Rye shows up for sure and unfortunately exacerbates the alcohol, but is otherwise a reasonable backing. Barrel flavor lurks in the background, but it doesn't overwhelm. It's a nice complex and rich rye. It tastes more like a rye than Pikesville 6, which is great if you want rye but I don't like as much. There's some spiciness going on for sure and it carries mostly the standard cinnamon but might have a little clove and nutmeg. It's definitely spicy and tart with some other flavors adding to its complexity. The complexity is enjoyable, but there aren't any of those flavors that wow me. There is a bit more mineral than I would like, but it isn't too bad considering the richness and complexity. Still, I think I'd prefer to sip Pikesville 6."
