4.0,I really enjoyed this one. It's sweet on the nose with vanilla and brown sugar. Going down you get a less sweet flavor followed by a nice spicy burn. Couldn't stop drinking and smelling it. Well done!

Smooth you and not very complex on the palate . Some botanicals and orange.  A little green pepper and vegetative as you go along. Tastes youn

2.0,"Nose: Fruit (plum, cherry), firewood smoke
Taste: sweet, grain, wheat, citrus juice
Feel: creamy but quick, sharp tongue start with polite and warm follow-up sips
Finish: medium-long, mid-throat

""Surprising opening sip with a smooth palate that runs quicker with each sip. Most likely a crowd-pleasing whiskey to share with fans of Maker's but a little too thin for seasoned tasters to buy a full bottle. Interesting, yet inoffensive; different, but not captivating.""

2.5/5.0"

Notes: I have really been looking forward to trying Rabbit Hole Bourbon, and when it was requested that I review, I jumped at the opportunity. First let’s start with the packaging: very attractive and modern. It does look good the collection for sure. This bourbon is pretty young, so I wasn’t anticipating a complex pour, but I will also say that I wasn’t disappointed with a boring drink. The four grain mashbill gives a lot of great flavor that I am certain will only get better as time goes by. Since there is a lot of heat and alcohol flavor preset, I couldn’t blame you for enjoying with some water or ice. The price isn’t terrible and it is available at most major liquor stores I have been to here in IL. Go ahead and grab a bottle for your collection sometime. Overall, I think that Rabbit Hole is a company to keep your eye on, they are going to be putting out some very choice batches in the years to come"

not much to it but wanting to like everything about it..."

On the palate, the cherry popped a little more for me, as did the oak, but the taste was otherwise as advertised by the nose. The finish was both long - with a slight hint of spicy black pepper - as well as all too inviting for a second sip. Much, much better than I anticipated overall."
