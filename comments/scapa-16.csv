4.0,"Brown sugar dominates the nose followed with vanilla.  A light sweetness of banana, honeysuckle and wafts of sea salt arrive on the nose. The longer it opens, the more prominent the fruity sweetness.  Light and thin body delivers honey appears first on the palate which opens to lemon-honeyed tea.   Medium finish with the honey sweetness and dry oakyness and a bit of black pepper.  A light-bodied spirit (like Dalwhinnie 15) that is light and easy.  Enjoyable.  The bourbon influence is obvious and works well.  The spirit improves as it opens. Definitely give some time. Might be improved if it was bottled at 43% or 46%.  Somewhat, unfortunately, pricey (like most whisk(e)y's these days. This would easily be enjoyed by more if better priced. [$79][86/100][Opened 10/25/14; Revisted: 12/29/15]"

4.0,"Nose: Delicate smoke, salty sea breeze and earthly tones. Malt and honey are the main attractions. Water adds peat in the mix.

Taste: Delicate peat with herbs, cinnamon and tea. Very earthly. Simple and delicious dram.

Finish: Hints of smoke and honey. Peat dominates, water makes it even more peaty.

Balance: Pretty straight forward whisky. Refreshing stuff!"

  Perfect fruity, sandalwood nose. Exceptionally smooth.  Finish of spice, light smoke, and seasame. A very delicate Scotch.
  
  Seriously, I bought 10 bottles of this stuff when I heard they were making a hiatus in production. May my collection never go dry."

3.0,"Decent dram.  Needed 10 minutes to open up.  Influenced by the fact I was drinking from a mason jar, rather than a proper scotch glass.  Sweet, caramel.   A touch of salt.  Forgetable is probably a good word.  85/100."

4.75,"Still getting to know this one, but am really appreciating it. It might even make it to my top shelf. Sweet, salty, spicy, and much more. If you can find a bottle, buy it!!! I may need to seek out another bottle. No longer available.....damn! I'll be nursing this one one for a while.

Ok, only a couple drams left. Honey, salted caramel, heather and spice. A hidden gem now lost forever. I'll share the last bit with a couple of tasting buddies who will appreciate it and then say goodbye."

4.0,"I don't get it.  This is now discontinued, but it's so damn good...what business sense does that make?  Are they running short of 16's?   I normally just have a dram on Friday and one on Sunday (Walking Dead day, Game of Thrones day, or the Giants and Jets get a whoop-ass day, depending on the season!) , but Scott send over a few samples this evening...and I couldn't resist.   Thank you Scott!!  I love Islanders.  Something about that sea smell, briny taste, and salty finish.  I really liked this  one for encompassing those salty elements.   My first Scapa...need to now try more...thanks again to Scott!"

4.0,"Many Bothans died to bring us this malt...I honestly thought the bar had left this one on the list as an oversight. That said, I have no idea how long this bottle has been open, or how well it's been stored since opening. However, in its present state, this one is a little shy and subdued. The nose is bolder, with heather, honey, and vanilla fudge sprinkled with sea salt...there's an appealing and light note of pipe tobacco in the background. The palate is restrained, but gentle and lovely with honey, floral notes, rich and creamy vanilla, and a hint of sweet tobacco smoke around the edges. If you can find it, it's worth a try."

4.0,"Nose: honey, pear, soft vanilla notes, sea air.
Palate: more of the same, with added floral character, notes of citrus, and an extra helping of orchard fruit. The salt is nicely present and brings depth to the dram.
Finish: medium, sweet and salty with a wisp of wood smoke and some spice.

A lovely whisky that doesn't quite taste 16 years old but that's still refined, elegant and complex. I don't have the chance of owning a bottle of it, but I do order it whenever it's available. If you like maritime whiskies but are looking to see the salt/sea air notes showcased somewhat differently than in the classic Islay style, this might be for you."

4.25,"My first Scapa was the skiren and i wasn't impressed. This one is a lot better, but i still think you can get a better whisky for the same money. 

This expression is also known as ""The Orcadian""

On the nose, Salt, Heather, Caramel, Dim grape, Blackberry. Very dim phenolic notes, 
After couple of minutes, blackberry jam opens.

On the palate it was very mellowed.
Caramel and dulce de leche. Cinnamon and Salt. Delicious.

Aftertaste was long, also with cinnamon and salt notes, quite nice. 

Overall this is more what i expect from an island Whisky, but i still think Highland Park rules over Orkney. 87/100."
4.0,"Bottled 2012.

This one has a little bit of a cult following.  It’s bottled at 40%.  Check.  It’s chill-filtered.  Check.  It’s got artificial coloring added.  Check.  So, why the cult following?  Right, so this one checks all the boxes for my opinion that a lot of whisky opinionators are missing the point.  I don’t know why Scapa decided to water this whisky down to the minimum required ABV, or chill-filter, or add color; they certainly don’t have a mass market to appeal to.  In the end, it does not matter.  Whiskies are not cars, and I do not care about specs.  This whisky is quirky; it has real soul; and that’s what matters.  If it is anemic or anorexic, it is 1990s high fashion.  Kate Moss playing with a rhubarb.

Scapa 16 does not give a fuck.  It is good without trying.  I can see how people would say this is watery or lacks complexity.  But those people are wrong.  This dram is soft, natural, intricate, and methodical like watching a dandelion flower.  At 40%, the power comes from the harmonies of flavors.  Rhubarb, apple, and black pepper.  Tomatillo, lemon, sea salt, and a hint of smoke.  Apricots, drizzle of honey, a touch of fresh mint.  It’s simply right.  You can drink this rapido, and just appreciate the easy sip.  Or, you can drink this pausado, and notice all the headnodding little notes that complement each other to produce a symphony.

Would this be as memorable if it were non chill-filtered, natural color, and bottled at 46%?  I don’t know.  This whisky’s charm is its nonchalant brilliance.  It is given the make-up of a mass-produced blended whisky, but nose it too long, and it will put a spell on you.

Score: * (unforgettably good)
How much does a bottle cost: Around $80 if you can hunt a dusty bottle at retail.  $150-300 on secondary market.
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $130"
3.0,The Orcadian - very smooth for an Islay - Gentlemanly smoke - good - worth the price when you want peat
