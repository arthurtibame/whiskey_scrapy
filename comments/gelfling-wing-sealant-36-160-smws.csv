4.0,"Nose: Fruit forward, light whisper of strawberry, kiwi, lemon, with a pleasant floral bouquet, dusty oak back end and vanilla throughout. Hard to believe it’s 60.2% 
Palate: WOW! There’s that 60%! Spicy upfront, Creme brûlée in the middle, and  vanilla creme puff on the sides after the spice dies down. There is oak on the back end.
Finish: Medium to long with mineral water with lemon, oak, slightly metallic tang. 
Overall: What a great dram! Too bad it only comes in at 100ml sample."
4.5,"Sweet, vanilla, and caramel smelling. Strong spicy oaky notes followed by strong warming pepper and light brine and smokiness. Has some hints of dark dried fruit. A lingering bitter peanut skin with undertones of delicate flavors of pears, jujube, and floral notes that develop and expand to the whole palate."
