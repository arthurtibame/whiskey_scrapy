3.5,"Deep, Rich Golden Caramel color.  Oily texture.  Nose is sweet and fruity with a hint of Vanilla.  Nice,balanced heat on the pallet, starts woody and sweet with brown sugar and finishes with a light amount of black pepper and spearmint.  Well balanced, drinkable on its own (no water needed)."

4.75,Rich. Fruity. Long and dry finish. Mouthfeel lingered for hours.
5.0,"Unique and welcoming marriage of southern oak spices and Garryana (OREGON OAK) dessert notes.  10,12 &14 year expressions blended beautifully.  Must try- limited edition."
4.25,"The nose carries strong oak - very unique, rich oak, I should add - and maple syrup notes, along with a hint of orange peel. The arrival is creamy smooth, with vanilla and some baking spice. The oak returns in earnest on the mid-palate, joined by toffee and spearmint gum. The finish is especially long for a spirit of this proof, with bitter dark chocolate, leather, spices and savory maple. A bit spendy at $80, but if you're in Oregon and looking for something tasty and distinctive, seek this one out."
