4.0,Not the spiciest of ryes but flavorful and great for summertime and outdoor adventures
2.25,I wish it was just a little spicier. A sweet vanilla rye with some spice and black pepper. Still very smooth and great for the price.

3.5,"I actually mixed it with Ginger Ale, I liked it.  It is the best bourbon I ever had? No, but for the price and as a mixer, not bad."

3.5,One of my favorite neat sippers. A slightly sweet flavoring goes down smoothly.  A splash of bitters (minus the orange zest and simple sugars) gives it a fun taste for a bit of not-quite-an-old fashioned creativity.

3.0,"Ok it's the review I said I wouldn't do.  Tin Cup Rye is the Colorado startups venture into the world of Rye and wouldn't you know, it comes from OF ALL PLACES, Indiana.  Let me think now, what Rye do we all know about that comes from the only large scale Indiana producer... hmm oh yea,,, MGP.   Of course it's just YET another, rebottling of the standard MGP juice we likely have all drank in our sleep by now.  Marketed at 90 proof,, (just like Dickel and Bulleit Rye, imagine that) and the standard 3 years which is almost certainly the minimum to get a drinkable rye product. 

So what does it taste like, have you ever had Bulleit or Dickel or the many other sourced MGP ryes?  Yep then you know what it tastes like.  Actually I get a bit of a metallic bitterness that I don't normally notice in Bulleit, perhaps it's my pallet or maybe some left over Stranahans from a barreling run, who knows, but the main thing is you will get a slightly dill and saw grassy with hints of pungenty citrus, Indiana rye.

Like the folks at Heaven Hill who decided we needed an Elijah Craig Rye, apparently the world was ready for and needed a Tin Cup rye also. Is standard Bulleit or Dickel rye great? No but they are at least drinkable., and that's exactly what Tin Cup Rye is, not great but drinkable.  At least they aren't asking a break the bank price for yet another sourced MGP rye, small favors I guess."

3.25,"Visiting family in VA and thought I'd see if I could find something not available here in NC. I found two, Cooper's Craft and the new Tin Cup Rye. It's Tin Cup's turn...

Nose: Dried Spices. Dill, Oregano, Black Pepper, Dry and Dusty. Slight Sweetness with a Polished Oak.
Neat: Spicy. Vanilla, Dill, Black Pepper, Grapefruit Peel, Eucalyptus, and a healthy Tingle. The finish is slightly warming with Vanilla, Black Licorice, and Light Oak coating the palate. 
Splash: Not much change. Only served to slightly mute the flavors.
Verdict: About what I expected. Nothing to separate it from MGP's other 95/5 offerings. All are around $30 and make great mixers."
