null,I'm going to a tasting of this on Nov. 11 at the distillery. Can't wait to try it.
4.0,"While in Denver this week, I had the opportunity to try this at the Westin hotel bar.  Of course, adding in the premium of Westin, I’m sure I overpaid at $8 /pour.  But regardless, I guess if I were to hold up three bottles that showcase the best American craft whiskies that’s not sourced but rather distilled themselves, this would definitely be one of those three.  Upfront candied cherries with caramel and chocolate, not overly deep and complex ...but really well made and enjoyable as a dessert dram.  Personally...I’ll be getting a bottle.  Food pairing: with dessert, something like  a chocolate mousse , light and airy high cocoa content"

4.0,"Delicious and smooth. The sherry is up front on the nose but waits until the end on the palate. Everything in between is candied cherries, caramel, and earth/wood. I found little to no lingering flavors. The mouth feel is smooth and finishes dry. Overall, I finding to be a wonderfully simple whiskey.
PS: I’m working on my descriptions and tasting notes. I welcome constructive disagreements."
4.0,Huge sherry nose and a deliciously sweet flavor profile. Not particularly complex but lovely nonetheless. A drop of water calms everything down.

4.0,Cherry and apricot dominate the nose. Sweet on the palate. The influence of the sherry hangs around long into the finish. It’s a bit too spicy on my palate neat. I prefer this one over ice

4.5,"Spoiler alert, this is the pick of the Stranahan Whiskey's! It's very hard to put this in a category! It's totally unique. On the pallette you are hit with apricots, apples and honey. You then get a clove and oak swell then quickly move to a long tobacco, leather and deep grape finish that lingers for ages. Lovely hug and menthol feel on the tongue. This is better than the Diamond Peak as it's more complex and not as syrupy. It's also very viscous. At 94 proof, that's impressive. The Sherry Cask influence is pronounced and I would guess it sat in those barrels for a good amount of time. Lovely dram! Strong recommendation!"

4.0,"Nose: cheery pie filling
Taste: up front is a flavor bomb of sugary fruit. Cherries, blackberry. Then astringent spice notes of vanilla bean and cinnamon. Similar to regular stranahan's, but with darker sweet notes in the background. 
Finish: found the finish to be long but fairly light. Some walnut goes in and out. Sherry notes of dried fruit. Vanilla. Random notes of intense fig.

4.5,"Absolutely delicious. This is a unique experience and not an every day sipper or go to whiskey. Every time I pour a nip, the first sip always gets me. A little clearing of the throat is needed. This is a well done sherry finish, and it’s absolutely just me. It initially catches me a bit off kilter, as if I’m overly confident and what to expect. Then, wham... a little dry, flip-flop gets me right in the corners of my throat and then a little tickle let’s me know, I’ve been foolish...again. It’s like a renewal of experience every time. I always think I know what to expect however, my palate memory is always reset .  The sherry cask finish is very pronounced here. But it doesn’t deter from the overall package you’re getting.  This is a well crafted spirit and truly,  an experience. Smooth, robust and very delightful. The sweetness only slightly lingers on the lips and just makes you want more. This is one of those selections you can whip out when you’re bored or you just need a total reset of everything you’ve been sampling or think you know.  $69.99/750 ml and usually sold out for a reason."

3.75,"I asked for this for Christmas. Interesting color and the bottle is topped with a nice metal bar jigger. Middlin' sweet alcohol vapor on the nosing. The slightest of sips from the Glencairn moves from tongue tip to the back in an evolving process. I do get a good deal of fruit flavors, everything from cherry and mango to coconut.  Admittedly I may have contaminated the process with some eggnog earlier on, not only spiked with the usual brandy, rum and blended whiskey, but also some Tolerance Ginger Liqueur, added in for effect with the grated nutmeg. Even tasting this after 30 minutes or so later, not the ideal conditions for true tasting of an otherwise fine whiskey. Put me on the naughty list then.  

I have to say I like this whiskey very much and put it in the same category as the David Phinney/Orin Hatch whiskeys like Slaughter House and Straight Edge: Experimental. It goes down very easy offering a variety of flavors and yet has sufficient whiskey bite to inform the senses that this is a decent effort. Ice chips improve things noticeably. No upper level complexity and no lingering finish here, but the swallow is still worth the bite, especially with some drawn air as with wine. It seems these wine-making whiskey makers just can't break old habits. Worth the asking price.

$70 in PA."

4.25,The nose has an apparent high abv at first but turns floral as you get accustomed to it.  The taste is amazing. It’s a little creamy with legs for days. Good floral and sherry flavors up front then hints of tobacco.

4.25,"The sherry cask aging is very apparent on both nose and taste. Very sweet. Drinks much like a thinner, less sweet port. Very different, but also enjoyable. A nice choice for a dessert wine. 4.15."
3.75,"Beautiful dark walnut color. On the nose very floral and sweet. Aromas of apricots and cherry. Forward sweetness on the pallet with dominating floral character. More apricots, raisins, oak, and vanilla. Aftertaste is long and dominated by vanilla and ripe fruit. A bit harsh, but overall pleasant and enjoyable. A few drops of water strengthen the fruitness even more, and pallet smoothens and becomes more rounded. Overall quite nice yet a bit harsh, which is not too surprising for this 4yo whiskey."
4.5,Sweet and smooth. I need this on my shelf.

The bar had this “on tap” from their own cask of this. Would like to try more from this distillery. This one was a sherry bomb finished with heavy spice."

3.5,"Super sweet Sherry notes, in the flavor and in the tail. It's super good and I taste complexity, but the Sherry kinda steamrolls everything else. Deep wood complexity under the flavor. A good dessert whiskey."
4.0,"Brick red color - clings to the glass with slow legs. Sherry really comes through on the nose. Maple, vanilla and sherry palate with a medium finish. Impressive! Maybe a bit of water - maybe."
4.5,"A generous taste courtesy of Pie Chef Guy.

First off, I really like a lot of sherry ages whiskeys, and at 94 proof, this masterpiece delivers on all marks. 

The nose is so surprisingly smooth and chocolaty. I am used to picking up on raisins first with sherry, but not this time. There is dark chocolate, dried figs and then raisins. These cover up light scents of cloves and maple candy.

Even the taste is smooth. It's like eating a handful of chocolate covered raisins (Raisinets anyone?). Then I am hit with flavors of vanilla, honey roasted pecans and a touch of some kind of sweet and salty brittle. 

Great to the last drop!"

Nose: Raspberries and butter.  Honestly it smells like a buttery raspberry pastry.  Some light oak notes as well as vanilla. 

Taste: Dried fruit like fig jam, brown sugar, light oak, a little bit of leather, light honey, and dried cherry.

Finish: Longer than I would have expected and back to raspberry Danish again but heavier on the wood.

This is my favorite cask finished whiskey to date.  I'd like to experiment putting this in to desserts for baking purposes.  Give this a shot if you can find it."

4.0,Apparently this is from Colorado. Hard to believe because it tastes like something out of Scotland. The sherry is wonderful and upfront on the nose and palate. Where this loses out to similar scotch is on the back end. The flavors drop off and take a couple sips to start sticking around. Other than that it is a fantastic bottle that Colorado should be proud of.
4.25,"If candy was a whiskey. Cherries and peaches on the nose with just a hint of alcohol. It literally explodes in the mouth. First off, it's definitely a malt, so make sure you're expecting some Scotch profile. The fruit gives way to smooth baking spices and a long warm finish. It's wonderful."

4.75,"Sweet sherry and sweet baking spices on the nose with hints of cherry & apricot.  The mouth on this is really silky/oily, I love this.  No peat, heavy sweet sherry, with the palate also having tastes of espresso coffee beans and a caramel toffee nuttiness.  This was a hit for me. This was flavorful and without the high alcohol content to get drunk, sipping on this you can have a few and be good for the night."
4.25,I love what the sherry cask does to this malt whiskey.  I am not really into the standard Stranahan’s but this is a winner.
