5.0,First Scotch Ever Purchase. It's love at first sight

3.0,"Vanilla, honey, some oak, and florals in the nose.  On the palate, I get vanilla, cream, honey, a touch of mixed spices, and a fleeting hint of chocolate.  Finish is a bit short.  A nice Scotch, especially for the price point."
4.0,"Surprisingly strong with plenty of spice and burn. But not excessive. A scotch with boldness. Also held up well to be iced down, kept character while mellowing"

4.0,"Wonderful value for money. Sensational floral honey on the nose, potent but not cloying. A medium body, and just a hint of nice smoke on the finish. Classic BenRiach, which I prefer to the 15."

3.0,"I definitely get a hint of chocolate on the nose and the palate. It starts out pretty smooth, then hits you with a spicy finish with a bit of smoke on the tail end. Solid."

4.0,"Herrliche braun-rote Farbe. Der Geruch erinnert stark an ein leeres benutztes Rotweinglas. Im Geschmack zuerst überraschend fruchtig, dann angenehm mild mit klaren Fassnoten. Die Erinnerung an süßlichen Portwein drängt sich auf, ohne dabei zu süß zu schmecken. Im Abgang dann erfrischend fruchtig-säuerlich."

3.0,"Again a birthday present, purchased at the same local shop as my cousin's wife picked up the more than decent Benriach Curiositas 10. As my friend doesn't know much about whisky, she showed them my instagram posts, and was recommended this Benriach 12. Although my preference clearly lies with peated whiskies lately, my Instagram feed runs a tad behind, and still shows a fair amount of non-peated whiskies too...
    The good impression of the Curiositas upped the bar for the 12 year old, but I think it held up to it. 
    On the nose perhaps a bit feint, but on the palate I found a typical light Speyside dram: a bit nutty, some vanilla and oak, moderate spices, and I imagine some orange zest. I don't find any traces of smoke, as I read in some other reviews, though. The finish is also rather short.
    All in all, this 12 year old Benriach is quite a decent dram considering it's price range, but if I had to choose, I would rather restock on the Curiositas over this one."
4.0,now we are talking.. much better than the ten year.

3.5,Smooth all through with fruity Christmas taste
3.5,Honey vanilla and that's about it. It didn't make that much of an impression with me but others in the tasting group seem to like it and the bottle got demolished by the end of the night
3.25,"Nose - Honey, hint of dried stone fruits, apple & pear, hint of sweet roasted nuts, vanilla

Taste - Honey, light gentle warmth, vanilla, apple/pear cider, hint of sour/fruity bitter, creamy mouthfeel

Finish - Honeyed cider, light heat, creamy mouthfeel lingers, light orchard fruit sweets taper off

Score - 74/100

Final Thoughts - So this was only a marginal improvement over their NAS ""Heart of Speyside"" in that it had a tiny bit more ""depth"" that made it feel a tiny bit older. Added a little more fruit to the nose & palate, but otherwise pretty one-dimensional. Slightly less off-putting bitter/sour but not much.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
3.5,Very heavy sherry. To sweet for me
