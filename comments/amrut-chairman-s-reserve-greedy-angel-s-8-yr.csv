4.5,"Now apparently there are quite a few variants of this whiskey, 8, 10, 12 yr etc.

This is I believe the original bottled in 2017 with a run of 1350 bottles. 

It was released for the 60th birthday celebration of the Chairman of Amrut. For the Chairman Mr. Neel Jagdale's birthday, they created the Greedy Angels 8 Year Old Chairman's Reserve Indian single malt - at the time, it was the oldest whisky they had released.

Now amongst the haze of Dramfest 2020 which despite 10 days passing I still haven't touched a whiskey (although that's about to change), this was towards the end and probably around the 900 mark but hey who really knows I just thought I'd pick a good one to celebrate the milestone. And it was..damn fine whiskey. One of my top 10 -15 out of the 120 plus that I recorded tasting. Would love a bottle but %$#!! the price dear godness...$250USD for an 8 year.

As an aside Amrut was in my top 5 bottlers/distilleries out of the 40 or so I tried."
