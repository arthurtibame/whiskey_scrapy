4.5,One of my all time favorite bourbons for $175.  I’ve tried a few different barrels but barrel 19 was phenomenal
3.25,"Odd this is here but no reviews?

Nose - corn, vanilla, custard filling, and oak. This is on the more mellow side of bourbon, nice rich notes, and a bit earthy and acidic on the finish.  I'm not digging this nose, but it's a lot of nice bourbon notes without any of the wow notes. Water and I get more vanilla cream and chocolate notes. An almost fluffy chocolate candy bar filling with oak and vanilla and caramel. 

Taste - Flavor is a whole other thing. I get dark cherries, chocolates, cream filled doughnuts, caramel, some candies...it's a mellow bourbon with CS richness. The finish is a very nice mellow chocolate and caramel...oak is here but it's lightly adding quality flavor and enhancing these nice sweet candy notes. There's a nutty note at the end as well, just in case you need that. 

This is awesome bourbon. it's insanely easy to drink with his high proof.

For 207...yeah this is over priced and isn't full of those old aged bourbon notes. It's not SPECIAL. That said, you just can't dislike this one. it's just good good bourbon. The nose is a touch weak.

3.0 - keep in mind 2.0 is average and 3.0 is really good stuff. But there's just not enough special to push this to the higher scores, but there's nothing wrong to the point I'm debating a 3.25. 

Moving up to a 3.25. This is bourbon done as well as it can but without WOW, but it's so good at what it does."
