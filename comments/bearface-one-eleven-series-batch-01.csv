3.5,"A WTF nose, all smoke and bbq, the Mezcal dominates everything, no hint on Canadian on the nose, the palate is all smoke and agave, unique and very interesting."
4.0,"Tasted Nov. 22, 2019. Spice and oak flavor leads to, a earthy and smokey finish. Very unique! The majority of our group liked it, but some found it a bit too weird. Try at your own risk, but I'll be picking up a bottle."
