4.0,"Peat smoke on the nose with some honeyed notes in the background. Palate isn’t as peaty as I was expecting but smoke still dominates. Some sweetness on the medium mouthfeel tries to balance the peat. If you like lighter smoked scotch, this might be for you. Fairy balanced, medium + finish. Nice but overpriced."

4.0,Really good peat flavor with a strong reminder that you are drinking scotch. Great blended scotch that is strong by itself or with a strong meal of cigar. One to have in the cabinet.
4.5,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I had a tasting last night where we shared a few drams with each other.  Any other night, this would’ve made my top pour.  But in the tasting where we had a Macallan from the 80s, Ardbeg Drum CE, Stranger and Stranger, and the unexpected beauty from Sweden’s Smogen, this unfortunately didn’t make my top 5.  Maybe 7 out of the 12.  Charred lemons, smoky.  Balanced with honey sweetness.   Thanks Richard for sharing!"

5.0,This is the best blend I've had so far
4.0,"Nose: Sultans and raisins. Taste: The sherry influence kicks in in the middle, in harmony with the smoke. There's no power struggle here, the flavors are only complementary. Finish: Long and creamy. Overall: Very nice. One of the best I've had from Compass Box."

2.0,"Spicy, peaty, smoky aroma. Rich mouthfeel with a spicy touch amongst all that peat. Not terribly balanced with some sweet and some spicy flavors competing and struggling against the smoky character. Hoped for more for the price."

5.0,"Oh my god, this is really good!!  I'm a huge fan of Compass Box...they're probably one of the few blenders who actually make something where the sum is worth more than the parts.   This is the whisky version of Priyanka Chopra (Google her...the Quantico star).  Amazingly great to look at, smooth, sexy, curves in the just the right places, and deep enough to warrant a night over meaningful contemplation.   How in the world did Distiller give it a 77!!!????   Did you sample the right whisky?   Nose is lemony and citrusy...let's you know it's Caol Ila lurking in there.  I can smell her perfume, teasing me into now going for a taste.  Palette is meaty...lemony..clean smoke.   Wow.  Like lemons grilling over a barbecue.  Finish is lovely, lingering and she wants you to come back for some more.  Can't wait for round 2.  And then round 3.  Till I'm all worn out and morning has arrived.  Maybe well into the morning as well...I can call in sick and enjoy her company all day long.  Yup.  This is my whisky version of Priyanka."
5.0,77??? Really?  You give HP10 an 87?  You guys are out to lunch with your scores.  This is an amazing dram and a review score this low is insulting. It's like the reviewer has never tasted a peated whisky before!
5.0,"This is an outstanding whisky, so much so that I can't help but think the reviewer's score was a typo. When most whiskies on this app appear to get an 80 just for showing up, a 77 for this whisky is absurd. Flaming Heart is complex and incredibly well composed. Ralfy gave it a 91; I think it deserves at least that on Distiller."

3.0,"It's an interesting beast. Initially all the nose gives you is fire, acrid smoke and peat; but after a while it either edges off or your nose gets used to it and it mellows out into what I can only describe as marmite – salt, umami, a hint of sticky sweetness – spread on burnt toast.

The palate is a bit disappointing, again, completely dominated by the smoke but with none of the interesting saltiness and sweetness that hung around in the wake of it all on the nose.

A rather short and rough finish leaves the whole experience a bit flat. Not an unpleasant dram by any measure, it's definitely interesting, but not sure I'd be shelling out a ton for a bottle."

4.0,"I was lucky enough to get a sample of this limited edition release by Compass Box Whisky from my good friend Lee a few months ago. I finally had the time to try it tonight and I’m glad I did. 

This is a blended malt scotch, the components of which are a combination of two different vintages of Caol Ila, Clynelish and Dailuaine. I’ll spare you the age, percentages and cask types of each as they are well documented. Bottled at 48.9% ABV and as all CBW whiskies are, it is non chill filtered and natural color. This is a golden straw color. 

Big peat smoke on the nose initially. Strong citrus, grilled lemons. I get salty baked whitefish with green olives on a plank of green oak. A bit of an unusual combo but it works. Burnt wood/campfire ashes, settling into what my in-laws basement smells like during Christmas when they have a nice fire going. Once the big smoky notes subsided, a beautiful wave of warm vanilla buttercream, toffee, caramel and toasted coconut  took over. Lovely but somewhat restrained fruits like peach, apricots and pineapple. Some dark chocolate rounds things out. 

The palate starts off with vegetal peat and sooty smoke. Smoked shellfish in a lemon/lime brine with some herbs. Baking spices like nutmeg, clove and pepper. Creamy vanilla comes in with oak and dark chocolate. Soft leathery notes and maybe the barest hint of tobacco. Every sip the smoke is the first thing you notice, but you get used to it and then can pick through everything else. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is oily, becoming dry. 
A medium long finish that is dry with lots of cold ashes, peat and vanilla. 

A well put together blended malt scotch. I’ve never had any of the individual components as single malts (soon to change), but they work well together. The casks are mostly American oak and it shows in the vanilla and toffee notes as well as the nutmeg and overall softness. It’s quite mature with the peat still playing a major role in the overall profile. Even though I’m giving this the same rating as I did with the Lost Blend, I think Lost Blend still holds the top spot from CBW for me. Thanks again @LeeEvolved for the lovely sample. 4.5
Cheers"

4.0,"With Round 2 of our distillery tour looming I figured I needed to work on a couple of open bottles I've had sitting around for a month or so.  Tonight is the night.  Up first:  Compass Box Flaming Heart (15th Anniversary).  This was bottled in July of 2015 with a total of 12,060 bottles available.  This is the 4th edition of the Flaming Heart series.  This is roughly made up of 65% Caol Ila (14 & 30 year old), 24% Clynelish (20 year old) and 10% Dailuane (7 year old).  It's bottled at a slightly robust 48.9% ABV and is non-chill filtered.  Enough with the technical mumbo jumbo...

The nose is heavily peated with subtle hints of red berry fruit, cookie dough and bourbon cask wood.  There's a lot of smoke so you really have to wait it out and get in there for the rest.  It's worth working for, though.

The initial sip is almost entirely peat.  You can tell it's primarily Caol Ila used in the blend.  It really overpowers, err shines, here.  I love Caol Ila and that makes this one another winner in my book.  Sea salt and briny seaweed stick to the tongue towards the finish which, in my opinion, makes you want to drink more.  

The finish is thick and oily.  There isn't much burn and it's all over pretty quickly.  This isn't my favorite CBW by a long shot but I can't see ever turning it down lol.

Overall, it smells better than it tastes and the taste is kind of one dimensional- peat.  But, if you love oily, peat bog whisky then seek out a bottle and give it a try.  I paid somewhere north of $100 for this bottle which is cheaper than their newer blends, yet slightly higher than their core stuff.  Buy it for the simple fact it's got 50% of whisky older than 20 years old.  That makes the price point pretty reasonable IMO.  4.25 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

5.0,"Age: NAS
Alcohol: 48.9%
Paid: $107
Components:
1: 38.5% 14 year old Caol Ila matured in refill American oak hogshead
2: 27.1% 30 year old Caol Ila matured in refill American oak hogshead
3: 24.1% 20 year old Clynelish matured in rejuvenated American oak hogshead
4: 10.3% blend of Clynelish, Teaninch, and Dailuaine matured in “highly active” new French oak hybdif barrels

This remains one of my favorite whiskies of all time.  Over a quarter of this blend is 30 year old Caol Ila.  Caol Ilas age exceptionally well, and become this decadent, refined, sultry, oily creature.  What makes this bottle a true piece of art is that the other 72.9% of the ingredients make this better than a 30 yeasr old Caol Ila.

Gentle meaty and hickory peat is on the nose that hints at how oily and waxy this will be on the palate.  Soft fruity notes, with a balanced assortment of leathers, salts, and oaks.  The palate and finish are a combination of the patiently immaculate oily, savoury, citrusy peat from the aged Caol Ila; the waxy, floral, acetones of the aged Clynelish; with just the right amount of spikiness from the younger ingredients.  This just may be the greatest affordable blended malt ever.  

MARK: 96/100.
If you can still find it, buy it!"

null,This is well put together and deserves a higher score than 77/100. But it is blended almost too well. Nothing sticks out. So I wouldn’t buy it despite the beautiful bottle.

Compass Box
Flaming Heart
Blended Malt
NAS
48.9% ABV
Bottled 07/2015
Limited to 12,060 bottles
Price: 107 USD.  I have another bottle I purchased for a few bucks more.  I will buy more if given the opportunity.

The 2015 Edition of Flaming Heart is peerless in terms of value for money.  Compass Box has more recently been harsh with pricing their limited edition releases, but this is the one that should have been five hundred dollars.

Many special bottlings of Compass Box are John Glaser’s attempts to recreate Brora, and this blend reminds me of the greatest Brora – nay, the greatest whisky – I’ve ever tasted: 1972 Rare Malts Brora.  Such an elegant, composed peat.  Quietly assertive and sophisticated; this is one to nose for an hour.  On the palate, this is mindblowing in slow motion.  The arrival is subtle, and the flavors gradually appear and build on top of one another.  As one fades, three new ones appear, and intensifies the flavor orchestra like brooms from Fantasia.  Maltiness, maritime, funky, medicinal, citrus, pineapple, chocolate, umami.  Everything is there, and each sip is different, as the dram breathes.  The finish is breathtaking, and the linger is long.

Ultimately, this is not nearly as deep or massive as the Brora, lacking its legendary mouthcoating oiliness, but this also adds some French oak spiciness, which Broras do not have.  The beauty of Compass Box is that as it secretly tries recreate old legendary single malts by the art of blending, it is unafraid to have its own flair.  And of all the Compass Box creations that I have had the pleasure of trying, this one is at the top.

Rating (price not factored): 95 / 100
Purchase satisfaction (price factored): 5 / 5"

4.5,"I know I’m not the first to post this, but how in the h*ll did Distiller score this a 77? Don’t get me wrong, people have their own preferences, but Serge at WhiskyFun gave it a 91 (who if you’re unfamiliar with his site, absolutely kills most bottles; he’s tough & fair in my opinion) while Whisky Advocate scores it a 93. As someone who has had almost every CB LE released in the past 4-5 years, this beauty of dram is still one of my absolute favorites."

5.0,"Tasted at Fountainhead in Chicago, a great whiskey bar.  Flaming Heart is a recurring series of Compass Box releases that features Caol Ila's peated whiskies prominently.  In this respect, one can think of it as a much more expensive ($125+) Johnnie Walker Black Label, another Caol Ila-heavy blended scotch.  I don't know that I'd pay that much for it, but the reasonable $16 I paid for a generous glass was just right.  My first note right off the bat was Caol Ila/Ardbeg character, meaning a combination of ashy smoke and lemon-lime citrus.  Complementing that punchy essence are dark caramel and then a complex mixture of creamy nut butters.  Flaming Heart finishes with a long, lingering exhalation of smoke.  I wouldn't have guessed a blend if I'd tasted this one blind, I would have thought that it's just a really good Islay single malt.  And that's about the highest compliment that I can give a whisky."
