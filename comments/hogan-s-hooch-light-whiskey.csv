5.0,"An aggressive nose of wind-blown straw and youthful ethyl notes. Golden raisins immediately present the palate, along with cereal grains evoking an image of raisins mixed into some nice a gooey oatmeal. The mouthfeel isn't as thin as I'd expected from such a young whiskey, it has itself some interesting viscosity. A mild spiciness on the finish, whispers of nutmeg. Overall, for a white dog whiskey this one has a bizarre and interesting character. Unlike anything I've ever had before. Whiskeys like these make me excited for the future of grain spirits everywhere."
