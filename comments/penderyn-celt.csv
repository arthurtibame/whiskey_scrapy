2.0,"I can now claim to have had Welsh whisky also. Mild and sweet on the nose with some fruity red-vineish undertones. Pointy and peaty on the palette, with a weird hint of cucumber? 2,5/5 — All is not lost however the Penderyn Peated Single Malt is quite good."

3.75,Very smooth. Touch on the peaty side. Light nose.
4.0,Nice summertime malt.  Light bodied with orchard fruit (peaches) and a wisp of smoky sea breeze.

2.5,"I tried a triple pack of Penderyn a while back and wasn't that impressed but I was just randomly trying spirits and liqueurs in those days (4 years ago). A year or so later I got into rum then whisky. Penderyn redeemed itself at Dramfest with Rich Oak so I thought I'd have a crack again. First impressions were right. It's almost like sweet spirit, bit of bitterness.  Not a lot going on 2.5"

3.75,"Appearance- lightly colored and thin. Nose of pear, lavender and acetone. Sweet and herbal.

The taste is of apple pie; baking spaces and fruits are evident. There is not much wood of the barrel except for a slight complexity with a hint of leather and tobacco on the finish. 

It’s not a particularly complex spirit but it is soft and well-rounded. Honestly, I think it’s rating here is much harsher than its bite."
3.75,"Warm, spicy, slighty peaty and smoky"

1.75,"Nose - Fruity peat smoke dominates, toasted brioche in the background, very clean simple/corn syrup sweet

Taste - Very clean initially, then this medicinal, iodine-like smoke appears, similar to an apple juice mixed with campfire ash

Finish - Lingering smoke, fruity ash, corn syrup/splenda sweet

Score - 50/100

Final Thoughts - I'm not a huge fan of peated whiskies and this is no exception. It's not quite as strong of a medicinal peat as Laphroaig, but it's close. The smoke dominates and any green apple I got from their unpeated expressions is gone, replaced by this splenda-like sweetness.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

On finit la soirée en beauté!
Comme dernier whisky de cette magnifique soirée, on nous sert un autre produit vieilli dans des fûts de scotch des Islay. Encore une fois, j'ai préféré la première version de ce whisky tourbé. On est ici, encore une fois, dans une délicatesse, une finesse, une subtilité... Merci encore pour cette belle soirée!"
