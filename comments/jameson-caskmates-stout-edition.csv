null,"It is a rare after summer rain evening I tried it to relax. Though indoors, it tasted like sweet roses first, then smokey and woody-peaty...
Hoping for cork cappings used soon, I am in love with Jameson's 15 or 12 yrs old as it was not very known yet until Professor James Burke talked about it in his TV series, out of the blue! Since then, year after year, it became a luck to find them at duty free shops for me. 
Thanks to my husband Sam for CASKMATE.
Long live Ireland! Worepsauj Adigexer!"

3.5,"Color: I normally don't talk about the color of a whiskey, but I thought it was cool the effect the barrell had on the whiskey. So the color is noticeably darker as an almost orange instead of the classic golden straw of standard Jameson. The stout that was present before it really must've altered everything a little.

Nose: On the nose your memory instantly welcomes back the classic familiar Jameson. Breakfast biscuits, citrus fruit, and honey all are present; but dark chocolate and malt are added too, with notes of sweet candy.

Taste: The palate is so good! The mouthfeel is so smooth and creamy. I tasted honey, what reminded me of Whoppers malt balls, some not unpleasant bitter hops, and milk chocolate on the short finish. I don't know why exactly, probably the creaminess and enjoyment found in this drink, but after a sip I'm also reminded of a cappuccino or caffe breve. 

Opinion: I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this whiskey! I love everything about it, from its smell to its taste, to its origins from a cool partnership! I'm a big fan and I would definitely buy it again! Sláinte!"

3.0,"Nose: Malt, raisins, brown sugar, cereal, light oak, sherry. Very much like regular Jameson, but with everything turned up one notch. Enhanced maltiness is the most notable characteristic, and a dash of water reveals a little hint of the stout cask aroma.

Palate: Soft and silky, a malty arrival with chocolate notes. A sweet cereal hint appears in the development which becomes creamy rather than silky as it unfolds. Good texture overall and a dash of water brings out some hidden sweetness.

Finish: Short. Very faintly spicy and dry as it fades out, leaving a final impression as of mocha coffee.

A pleasant and successful variant of Jameson where the stout cask finish enhances the malty quality of the distillate considerably, but at the cost of some of the delicate citrus and fruity notes normally found in Jameson. It's a relatively subtle effect and although others have remarked how much it tastes of stout I didn't really get that impression. If anything, the stout cask finish gives this a profile slightly like a Speyside malt rather than an Irish blend.

Adding a dash of water makes it very smooth and easy to drink, but sacrifices a tad of the presence - note also that it's very easy to drown so if watering all you need is a few drops.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

2.0,"This was disappointing. I’d tried what I assume must’ve been the first batch, it had the same label as shown in the picture whereas the current label is black with white lettering. That batch had a nice influence from the stout casks that really came across on the palette and especially the finish. This new batch is severely lacking in that regard. It tastes like Jameson but there’s next to no stout notes to be found anywhere. I’ll be keeping my eye open for a bottle from the first go-round but avoid the current batch."

3.75,"Even for those like me who find regular Jameson a pleasant if mild libation that simply does the job while being nothing to write home about, this is far too interesting a concoction to pass up trying.  And glad I am that I did. 

The afore mentioned ""pleasant"" Jameson nose is accented with spicy floral and sweet notes.   A very nice start. 

Up front this is rich(far richer than plain jane James) and the malt mocha and sweet dark sugars jump out, I get just hints of citrus and rose  wrapped in bold spice and chocolate,  this is not entirely unlike a Black Bush variant minus it's notable cereals. 

On the backside the butterscotch smoothness kicks in and only a hint of the stout brew cask is left to remind the barley lovers in us that this was actually enhanced in a beer cask and not just over barleyed on the mash side.   This is really an enjoyable treat and break from the tradition of plain old Irish and makes the caskmate concept a worthy choice, I find it far superior to the IPA edition and would heartily recommend this for the traditional whiskey bourbon drinkers bucket list. 

Like the other Jamesons, this one retains the smoothness and lack of heat, making it an incredibly easy straight drinker.  A well done one off and great change up for the Jameson  lineup."

3.0,"Picked up a 200ml bottle on impulse when checking out at the ABC the other day. After trying and enjoying the Caskmate IPA Edition this had been on my radar for a while. It was mentioned in another review that there were two different label designs. FWIW, my label looks like the picture featured on this site.
*Nose (Glencairn): Unique nose! The Stout is front and center with chocolate, honeycomb, malt, vanilla, wet hay and a floral note. When reviewing the IPA edition, most of my notes were ""hints of"" or ""light"". You won't see those much in this review as the notes of this one are bold and heavy.
*Neat (Glencairn): Whoah, this is sweet! Like an overly rich dessert. Heavy mouthfeel. Chocolate, honey, mocha coffee, and butterscotch are all present. The Stout barrel really imparts a ton of flavor. It ends with no burn and a bitter beery finish. Bitter dark chocolate and black pepper coat and linger. After a few moments a medicinal note similar to prescription cough syrup began to creep in.

Verdict: While I did like this one, it was a little too sweet for me. There is A LOT going on here, and none of it is subtle. I think I might be in the minority here in preferring the IPA version and it's lighter notes, even though I don't really like IPA's and do enjoy the occasional pint of Stout. Go figure..."

2) It's full of rich malty and dark chocolate notes.
Other than that you get the standard sweet Jameson profile. Unlike the IPA, this one to me is worth the extra coin.

4.0,"I've had Jameson a lot, as many of us have at bars for shots. I like it and think it's a good sipping Irish but at $30 it is a little pricy for a base level name brand Irish. So I was skeptical trying their other whiskeys until I saw so many great reviews for this I couldn't resist. It was on sale and also came with a 50 mL Jameson original so I had an easy point of comparison. The Caskmates Stout is utterly fantastic and frankly dangerous to drink with friends. The stout barrel adds a layer of creaminess that smoothes out the original without adding heavy stout notes. I would know this because I'm a huge beer drinker and mostly dislike stouts, and I didn't taste stout up front. I think it just makes Jameson better, and you can sip on this like a heavy beer or wine and finish 2 oz pours in no time. Honestly I'd love to see this released as a cask strength version and see how crazy it gets."
3.0,"I give it a 3 because of the value - 2.75 if it were only based on taste. Certainly goes down smoother than regular Jameson but I didn’t get enough of the richness of the stout barrels. It worked well neat, but might have to give this one a shot on the rocks next"

3.25,"My wife bought a bottle of the standard Jameson and it came with a miniature of both the stout and IPA editions of the Caskmates expressions, so I decided to do a side by side. 

The Stout Caskmates is the standard Jameson that is finished in casks that once held stout beer. It’s bottled at 40% ABV and is chill filtered and has colorant added making it a honey gold. 

The nose is very similar to the standard Jameson in that it has lots of honey, very malty and grainy. This version seems to be creamier than any other Jameson I’ve had. A very light oaky note, some light vanilla. The stout casks are not very dominant here but I do detect a roasted malt feel that is typical of dark stouts. A very light citrus note, fairly floral and a touch of butterscotch. 

The palate is better than the standard Jameson, less harsh with a darker feel to it. Cereal malt, fairly grainy with creamy vanilla. Butterscotch, very light lemon peel. The metallic note that I get in most Irish whiskies is still present here but is minimal. A touch of pepper. Fairly boring, but inoffensive. 

A light bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium length, malty, some grain alcohol and vanilla. 

What can I say...it’s Jameson. This one is the same, only different. I would take this one if I had to pick a Jameson, but given the choice I’d rather not have to drink Jameson at all. I liked the nose on this one better than the IPA Edition, but I think I preferred the palate of the IPA to this one. For $33 it’s not terrible, but I’d rather get something else. 3.25

3.0,"So I picked this up for St. Paddy’s Day because it’s about the only time of the year I go Irish - in whiskey anyway. Lots of positive talk/reviews of this one in some of the whiskey groups I frequent so I figured what the hell. Let’s give it a go shall we?

This version of Jameson is matured in “craft beer barrels” according to the label. Notice it doesn’t actually say “Stout” beer barrels, the name not withstanding. It’s bottled at the typical 40% ABV and is a nice medium gold in the glass. I expect it’s both colored and filtered. It leaves thin watery legs and not a few water droplets on the glass when you give it a swirl. 

The nose is pleasant enough with weak mild fruits, honey, and weak malty biscuits. Notice the word “weak”; it’s gonna come up a few more times before this review is over. 

The palate has light honey, butter, weak fruits, and no trace of Stout that I could discern. Definitely none of the coffee or chocolate notes that are typical in Stout. There is an odd flavor I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Not bad, just something I really couldn’t identify. Maybe that’s the influence of the beer barrels? Hops maybe?

The finish is short and the flavor I couldn’t identify carries through to the finish. Again, it’s not unpleasant, just different. Overall this isn’t a bad dram for $30. Its definitely drinkable if not memorable. 3/5. Sláinte!"

3.75,"Nose:  Sweet grain, toasted corn, a bit of nice spice, a rounded honey-like sweetness.  Searching for stout influence leads me to a chocolate malt note, not chocolate itself, but that dark note from toasted barley.  There's a vanilla milk-chocolate sweetness in the back too.

Palate: Light and watery at first.  Turns dark honey sweet with a surprising amount of light floral and a bit of citrus.  The stout is there in the back as well with a woody chocolate.  A bit of dark toffee with a coffee hint, then back to sweet dark honey.  Loads more chocolate-coffee stout influence now on the second go.  The stout hits mid-to-back-palate where it lingers on the way back of the tongue.

Finish:  Medium-short, slightly sweet.  Milk chocolate is the main lingering note.  Maybe a bit of peach too? odd.  Much more milk chocolate now that lingers way on the back of the tongue with a bit of woody vanilla.  

Conclusion:  At the first sip, I thought this was going to be pretty boring, but after giving it a little while to open up it changed completely.  So much chocolate now that I'd have a hard time drinking more than a small pour at a time.  I'd honestly prefer a little less sweetness, but I can also see why it is so sweet.  A pour of this for desert might be a good way to drink it.  I'm impressed, for a budget whiskey, this one's got some real complexity and character!"

3.0,"Nose: chocolate, hints of wood, and unsurprisingly, beer. Some faint honey as well.

Palate: coffee and dark chocolate. Slightly bitter. Some spice pound cake in there as well. Mouthfeel is moderately thick.

Finish. Dry and incredibly short. One of the shortest I’ve had in awhile. Not particularly complex. More wood and chocolate but you really have to search for it.

Overall: ABOVE AVERAGE. A decent upgrade from standard Jameson. If I had to have a bottle of Jameson in my collection, I would definitely choose one of their caskmates. As with most Irish whiskeys, it’s a good balance between a bourbon and a scotch, but it will
likely be replaced with a better Irish whiskey once the bottle is empty. Reasonably priced and readily available, this is an “everyday” Irish whiskey that could work well in cocktails and makes a semi-decent sipper on it’s own"

3.0,"The stout beer aromas are immediately apparent, with coffee, chocolate and vanilla with the typical Jameson aromas of orchard fruit and floral honey.  To the palate I find this one much more exciting, with the same flavours as the standard expression, but also layers of stout beer, dark hops, chocolate malt and hints of coffee layered on with a creamy texture that reminds of a frothy beer head.

Finish: Strong, ethanol burn into stouty linger, short. Water made it smoother, though the stout flavor became muted and malt more prominent."
2.0,"The nose is oatmeal shortbread with a little bit of cream and honey. Oak and caramel apple (like at Halloween) is fairly strong at the end of the nosing. This is really sweet on the taste, too sweet for me in a way that reminded me of simple syrup and only gives a little ground to the apple and honey. The interesting oatmeal on the nose is missing and this just tastes like a fairly generic Irish. The finish gets a little bit darker and I think I can begin to see the stout-influence but then it's over. I had this with a bit of a spicy meal, so that may have obscured some virtues of it, but I was really disappointed with this."

The initial taste is pretty mellow, but it seems to get more and more mellow, while also allowing the ABV to stand tall. Marshmallow is a very obvious ending to me, after a creamy milky cereal bowl taste combined with a tad of citrus starts the round off. This is an interesting experience to me; although it's been a while since I've had standard Jameson, I know this does not have a similar taste to the classic."

Them subtle cocoa notes arrive, followed by a delicate sprinkling of cinnamon. As I take a second and third sip, earthy notes, perhaps hops, but very subtle and not very bitter, present themselves. The finish is essentially a short linger of the cinnamon and cocoa. The overall flavor is subtle but excellent. I can't help but wish the flavors were just a little stronger.

Classic Jamo punching through with buttery shortbread, citrus, and herbal notes, but overall more filled out.  Even getting some darker base notes for everything else to stand on.

Palate: Milk chocolate.  Cultured butter.  Orange blossom, honeysuckle, vanilla.  A little tannin and oak coming through.  Mint, orange zest, sweet basil.  Again, presenting as if it were a higher proof while still incredibly easy to drink.  Mouthfeel is medium-light.  Finish is medium-short, leading off with bitter chocolate, orange, mint, and fresh cut grass.  The high and low palate melt away with hints of toasted marshmallow, nutmeg, and graham crackers showing through.  Eventually you're left with a bitter milk chocolate character.

Other notes: Though maybe not as focused as I would've hoped, this shows what a few months of a seasoned barrel can do.  Well executed."

The stout doesn't show up until the middle end with some hot cocoa and marshmallow.  The finish is tart and sweet, then a final weird funky, bitter molasses or dark treacle that seems to linger for a while

It's a personal taste thing, but this was about 90% great upgrade from standard Jameson, until that weird ending that makes me want to take another sip.  It is pretty smooth and adds some interesting flavors, so this is worth a try for those that don't stomach the standard"

3.75,"Nose: frosting, banana cake, and vanilla. A hint of dark roasted notes notes.

Palate: the cake frosting and vanilla. Body is very nice and smooth/a bit oily, making it dessert-like. Some notes of caramel and chocolate.

Finish: a slight bitterness leaves a few notes of chocolate and oak lingering in the finish. But they still feel well-balanced.

All in all a very solid dram that I would love to try at cask strength to see if it can amplify the rich balance of the sweet and bitter notes."

Super silly, smooth and lasting. For me, it has a little less caramel nose than the IPA, but the lasting taste more than makes up for it."

3.5,"Having just tried the Caskmates IPA, I didn't have high hopes for this. BOY, WAS I WRONG. It has such a nice rich chocolate-cream on the nose that it made normal Jameson smell like relatively nothing when I went back for a comparison. The mouthfeel is a lot heavier and a lot more satisfying in my opinion. The taste carries those rich chocolatey notes into your mouth before having a nice black pepper finish that doesn't seem to last long enough. Very good whiskey."
