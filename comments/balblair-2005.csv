4.0,"I may have just encountered my favorite Balblair yet - there's a lot to enjoy here. I'm particularly impressed by how fruity this whisky is despite being exclusively aged in bourbon casks. The nose has notes of fruitcake and almonds, both quite pleasurable though they eventually over welcome their stay. The palate is almost sherried, with a faint touch of smoke, like matching sticks. And while the finish is a tad bitter, it is also quite smooth and long, with hints of pepper lingering on your tongue. I very much enjoyed it, and there's much complexity here despite a color that approximates white wine."

2.5,Nose is a bit glueish almost sakeish. Very little flavour compared to the Glendelough I had again mild vanilla ethonally sake. All the Balblairs I've had have been solid 3.5 affairs. This 2.5

4.25,"Never had a Balblair before and i didn't have any expectations. Actually is a good dram, i wouldn't buy it again, but it is enjoyable and if i ever find it in a party i would drink it.

Bottled at 46%abv with a pale staw color.

On the nose only 4 notes but lovely aroma: cake, butter, chocolate butter cake (lol) and some herbal note. 

On the palate, more complex and interesting: hay, tobacco, smoke, ashes, bitter chocolate, brownie. It is oily and hot, and the finish is medium long, hot but pleasant.

Overall i give this dram an 88 over 100. Cheers!"

3.75,"The nose is intially off-putting, but hints of banana come through once it opens up. Surprisingly sweet given the nose, bananas, pears and almost a plum quality. The finish has a burn, but the fruity notes do linger."

3.75,"The first dram from this bottle was very disappointing. Then I let the next dram sit in the glass for 30 min and what a difference. The dram the next day was delicious. Creamy , raisin, dates some herbal notes with a dry finish. A touch of smoke . Really enjoying this one."

4.25,"Having a 2017 year of bottling.
Very nice, soft and fruity to the nose. And to the contrary - very sharp at the beginning, like even knocking to my taste. Very fruity (citrus at most, lemon and the orange peel), with honey and vanilla hints both to the nose and to the tongue. 
Not that spicy and with a slight shade of smoke (not peated). Also one can feel a barrel and oak at some point. And of course green apples.
Also a small nuance of flower dust and pollen (like from the meadows).
Finish is very pleasant and soft. Really gentle and fulfilling. Very warm and calming. Satisfying in fine."
