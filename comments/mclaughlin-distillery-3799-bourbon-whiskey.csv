5.0,"Very unique for a bourbon.  Like drinking a brisket, lots of barbeque sauce and some smoke as well.  Every now and then I get some vanilla and almost a melon or banana note as well."
3.75,A little smoky...and great finish.
3.5,"Varies from batch to batch, but the 100% corn, exquisitely aromatic, mash bill delivers a sweetness that can't be missed. Heavy oakey char on the palate. Appropriately and pleasantly warm the whole drink through.  It's a pricier bottle for me; however the support of the local guy and the passion put into each bottle is worth it."
4.0,"Smells like a workshop in all the best ways. Hand cut wood, sweet corn, hints of a campfire. Tastes like mesquite BBQ sauce, oaky goodness, and creamed corn. A lovely bourbon from a little Pittsburgh distillery. Got to meet the owner and take a tour it was a blast!"
