5.0,"beautiful soft tropical fruit notes on the nose. this lovely whisky is filled with delight. sunshine warms you from the inside while the honeyed floral notes dance.
the finish brings out passionfruit with a hint of a mineral Tang.
for a 46% whisky this whisky drinks like water. silky smooth and softer than a a cloud."
