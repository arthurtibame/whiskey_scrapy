3.25,"The second of Cardona distilleries two offerings. The bourbon effort I found sadly lacking. Very light and delicate...I had to really drown the thing to get anything out of it. It was 66.7% however which is I think the highest % non-bourbon whiskey I've had I think. Sweetness, hint of vanilla but did struggle to make a dent in my palate. I did try this after the newest Longrow cask strength 14 year old Sherry wood which has just hit the market and before that 15 yr Springbank, the Sanaig and the Balvenie Caribbean cask so maybe one for trying first with water.  I really can't give it more than a 3.25 though."
