4.0,"And counting down on my last few samples of closed distilleries. Rosebank, Port Dundas, Carsebridge, Glenesk and then that's all I can get my hands on at a not stupid price.

I have seen a few more whole bottlings in the wild starting at $1000USD including Banff, Mosstowie but sadly the only few samples I've seen are stupidly expensive..generally$60 to $100USD even before you even add shipping taxes etc. There were still around 20 distilleries closed in the 1970's and the 1980's massacre i never got to try but c'est la vie I did have a crack at many others.

Pittyvaich is one of those that isn't just a token effort. They've done a great job at representing this distillery. With water beautiful sweet perfectly balanced vanilla and honey. Aftertaste slightly bitter and short but still nice way to experience another ghost distillery offering."
