4.0,"[06.2014] Ryan brought this back from Clermont and I've grabbed a few bottles since when I've been down for NAILE. Keith nailed the review notes, but don't water this one down - enjoy it like the old boys (and girls) did. 

Barrel oak hits you unabashedly at first taste. Caramel and salty with a bit of spice. Extra proof is evident with the heat. Briny with a touch of smoke. Not too oily, which is definitely a plus for me. This is old school at its finest. Initial review gave it three stars but it's grown on me since."
null,This is a really fun bookers light. Very similar profile but the 20 lower proof makes for a more accessible ride. Def grab a bottle if u do the beam tour.

4.0,"Strong heat on the nose, apple cider and some curry notes as well. after a few minutes I get vanilla and shellfish. This feels substantial on the tongue, but initially the taste is thin. The flavor kicks in at the end. Honey, baking spices, orange zest, peanuts. Short to medium finish. Lots of bang for your buck. If I ever visit the distillery, I'm buying one or three. 6/13/17"

3.0,"Nose: vanilla, little bit of tobacco, buttery with some caramel, some almond
Palate: dark cherry, little bit of cacao, some toasted oak
Finish: doesn’t have much bite, a little bit of cinnamon
General Thoughts: I even watered it down and I think i prefer the higher ABV. This stuff is good, I would definitely make this a frequent purchase if it was convenient."

4.0,"Thesis Statement- (I’m going to start choosing one phrase to summarize a bourbon)- orange marmalade

Nose- brown sugar and sweet tea with a hint of astringency 
Body- Sweet with cinnamon and black pepper give way to orange marmalade and a hint of ginger. 
Finish- The orange marmalade hangs there with some brown sugar as well. This thing is sweet!

I really like this. It is an easy drink at 100 proof and has a strong citrus note. I’ll pick up some more next year when I visit God’s country."

3.0,"Old Tub, to my knowledge could only be picked up in the gift shop at Jim Beam, but I found it at a liquor store in Louisville for $15. Aged 4 years and bottled in bond. 

Nose: Not very complex, basic bourbon nose - caramel, vanilla, char and ethanol, slight peanut

Palate: a little harsh, but mellows out the longer it sits, Kentucky Hug going down - slight grain, caramel and vanilla, ethanol, cinnamon spice finish, possibly a marshmallow note in the middle? 

This is an ok bourbon. I don’t know if $15 for a 375mL 4 year BiB Bourbon is priced correctly, but I appreciate the liquid.

3.75,"Cherry and citrus, with a nice sweetness reminiscent of an old fashioned starts off the nose of this 4yr old BIB. Oak forward with a slight burn starting halfway back your tongue, burns all the way down though, in a good way. Finish with a hint vanilla and licorice as the warmth worked its way down."

4.0,"A very interesting whiskey. Immediate sweet notes of caramel, and subtle notes of vanilla, as well as oak on the nose. Has a spice at first taste, but it quickly mellows out. I also pick up nuances of citrus and apple with this one. I love that it is bottled in bond, and the history that goes along with it. A good bourbon, that has the perfect amount of bite, in my opinion. Given it’s higher abv, and for only being aged 4 years, I would say that it is fairly smooth as well. An all around great bourbon that packs a punch."
