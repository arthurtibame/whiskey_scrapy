5.0,"This is an amazing tasting whiskey, not sure which batch the reviewer had, but I could not have been more impressed with this bottling. I compare it closely in its complexity and mouth coating ability to George T. Stagg. This is a more intense flavoring of of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. If you get a chance to try this at the distillery do so, if you get a chancec to purchase it, don't hesitate, buy it!"

5.0,"Surprising spice for a wheated bourbon.  Great complexity with vanilla, toffee and a little apricot.  Only a hint of floral for me.  Expensive, but I consider it to be great stuff."

5.0,"I got to try this while doing the bourbon trail and doing the tasting at the distillery.  I really enjoyed it.  I thought it was one of the best tasting bourbons I had that week.  The cognac finish was very apparent making its flavor profile  very different from the other bourbons we tasted that week.  While the proof was very high, I thought it was quite smooth and the flavors were delicious.  The dark chocolate covered cherries notes were most prominent."

4.5,"Barrels #44829-44835

8 year wheated bourbon finished for 21 months in Cognac

Nose - (w/o water) Rich brown simple, caramels, milk chocolate, fruity glazed sweet roasted nuts, sweet leather/tobacco (w/ water) Preserves the nose but softens/lightens/brightens the nose and it isn't as ""dark""

Taste - (w/o water) Sweet dark caramels, cinnamon/white pepper heat/tingle emerges, milk chocolates, sweet macadamia praline, sweet leather/tobacco dryness (w/ water) Reduces the initial heat/tingle, slightly more drying, delays the heat/tingle until the very end while preserving all of the undiluted flavors

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering heat/tingle, rich spicy caramels, milk chocolate, light oaky/dark chocolate bitter (w/ water) Heat is intensified here, similar finish w/o the bitter

Score - 92/100

Final Thoughts - This is quite amazing. It has all the classic bourbon flavors, very well balanced, and although I don't get too much cognac influence I think it added that slight bit of fruity mellowness to the spirit. This handled water amazingly well and I think actually enhances the nose & the palate with the delayed heat/tingle.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - If I could find one at a reasonable price"
4.5,How this is an 84 is laughable. 124.4 proof is sensational. Rich oily and smooth.

3.0,"63.2 ABV. Lots of alcohol on the nose. I can discern some orange zest, and oddly, new car and mothballs. After a few minutes some honey scents emerge. Intense on the tongue, the bitter orange zest carries over from the nose. Sweet. Woody and bitter aftertaste. Flavors linger a while. After adding a few drops of water, the nose opens up with some brown sugar and vanilla, and more classic bourbon flavors on the tongue. 7/14/17"
