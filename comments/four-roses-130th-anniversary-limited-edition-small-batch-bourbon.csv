4.0,Warm upfront and smooth
4.5,One of the best bourbons of 2018 in my opinion. Has your spicer four roses profile but more smooth and very enjoyable to drink. Could easily drink this whole bottle with friends and family in one night.

4.75,Woody vanilla nose. Taste Comes on hot but quickly changes to vanilla wood leather and fruit possibly cherry. Nice long finish with fruit and wood.

4.0,Best part is the nose. No whiff of alcohol whatsoever despite the complexity. I had side by side with regular small batch and it tastes like its just a smoother version with better hits of spice with no alcohol burn. Medium finish that is not as bitter as the regular version. But 4 roses went for balanced vs uniqueness so its an eh in special taste. Could easily be an everyday drinker albeit expensive

5.0,"This is one of the best Four Roses SmbLE’s that I’ve tasted.  My only regret is not getting a second bottle.  This has a great nose, very approachable despite being Barrel Proof, just so delicious, complex, and a wonderful, lingering finish.  This may be a perfect bourbon."

4.0,"Nose- Brown sugar and a hint of green apple
Body- The high rye definitely comes through with baking spices,pepper, and then cinnamon. Starts really sweet and then turns very spicy.
Finish- Black pepper and mint. 

This is a very complex, rye forward four rose rendition. Good but not for everyday."

5.0,"Collective notes with my wife Kayla and friend Brian. 

Nose: Salted Caramel. Brown sugar. Plum. Honeysuckle. Grape. Oak. 

Palate: Vanilla. Butterscotch. Creme Brulee. Saigon Cinnamon. Soft fruit. Strawberries and cream candy. 

Finish: Unbelievably sweet finish. Long, slow to taper. Balanced. Lingering delicate oak."
5.0,This stuff is delicious! Excellent nose and long finish. Preferred 17 pallet but this isn’t far behind.
4.25,"Great nose. Floral and fruity, no alcohol burn. Palate is very good, finish is solid. Need to compare to my barrel strength picks."

4.25,This bourbon is everything I look for in a whiskey. Lots of flavor without selling out in one direction and complexity that shows itself as you slowly sip and savor it. The proof is perfect to showcase that complexity and maintain the flavors without overpowering the palette.

4.25,Piney acetone nose. Citrusy and herbal up front. Oak and wildflower honey finish.

4.5,"Nose: Nice balanced mix of oak, honey, vanilla and peach.

Taste: Very similar to the fragrance. Peach, vanilla bean, lightly toasted oak and honeysuckle nectar give way to a spicy finish of cinnamon and clove."

4.75,"Almost prefect, have always loved four roses expressions and this doesn’t disappoint.  Delicate floral, fruit, baking spice nose.  Could smell all night...More of the bourbon flavors come through on the palate with caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, cherry, apples, allspice, a bit of a cream brûlée note?    Finish is on medium to long side which is why this isn’t a 5.  Get a little cinnamon, slight minty on finish with a subtle oak.   This is like a mixed berry, apple cinnamon pie with a burnt brown sugar/ Carmel drizzle on top.  Sweet & Yummy, will buy at retail anytime I can find."

4.5,Incredible
4.25,"This one has been a bit of unicorn for me. Finally tracked down a pour. 

The nose in this whiskey is at once recognizable as Four Roses, but with a good deal more depth and richness than usual. Loads of caramel, vanilla, toasted coconut, graham cracker, and toasted marshmallow meet with the typical notes of rye spice, mashed bananas, and a touch of acetone. The palate is something like buttered popcorn, more toasted coconut, toasted hazelnuts, milk chocolate, and a pleasant hit of barrel spice and rye. The finish is long and warm, bringing out all of the wood sugars, heavy vanilla, and a hit of musty oak. Not sure it’s worth the secondary price, but quite tasty."

3.75,"Incredible amounts of oak on the nose, vanilla crème and a touch of cherry. Very spicy! Let it open up to get chocolate, cherry and a bit of leather. Long finish."
4.5,"The nose is hot at first but opens up as it breathes and has smooth vanilla, oak, baked apples, rye spices and a touch of caramel holding it all together. The palate is dry and starts off with rye and baking spices with rich vanilla and caramel, followed by cooked brown sugar and dark chocolate. The finish is long and gently spicy with fading rye, vanilla, oak and caramel sweetness. Excellent."

4.0,"mild nose (and palette to start), sweeter than others in the four roses family, graham cracker/cookie and some floral

Palate starts off fairly sweet, doesn’t carry a ton of spice up front but it comes on and lingers; notes of black pepper and a hint of chocolate"
4.5,"Nose- almond croissant, baked apples, honey, caramel, oak, peach, vanilla, cherries

Palate- citrus, ranier cherries, oak, spices, baked apples, ginger, and vanilla

Finish- buttery and creamy mouthfeel , with a long and complex finish with notes of toasted oak, ginger spice and fruits

This is a fantastic bourbon. High proof and bold but never too hot. Oak is present throughout, just like any Four Roses LE. Nice flavors of fruit and savory spice as well. would certainly not feel good about paying $300+ for this, but for MSRP, it’s a homerun. Also comes in an awesome bottle."
