4.75,"A nice and elegant dram with notes of raisins, walnuts, almonds, hazlenuts, cashews, bitter oranges, dark chocolate, pepper, baking spices, toffee, vanilla, citrus, and prunes. Wish it was a bit thicker on palate."
4.75,"Real Scotch, a bite that quickly mellows beautifully."
4.5,"Nose- candied ginger, caramel, lemons, cedar wood, cinnamon

Palate- Bursting flavors of lemon initially, ginger, wood spice, figs

Finish- long, tasty finish with bright citrus and a creamy mouthfeel

Really, really nice. Quite complex on the nose and palate. This whisky evolves as you drink it, a quality that I enjoy. I love the ginger notes that i’m used to with macallan, but the estate addition really focused on them. The wood spice dominates a bit at points, but it’s mingled in well with bright citrus and caramel."
