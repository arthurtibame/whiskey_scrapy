5.0,"Just an other worldly great experience.  The underlying malt with the light salts and gentle peat is so deep and complex, it wasn't until my second pour that I realized there was even sherry influence.  Of course the perfect blending of oak, spirit, and the finishing of sherry is what brings this one together.  Truly an out of body experience.  

If I could give more refined scores this would be a 96 or 97."
