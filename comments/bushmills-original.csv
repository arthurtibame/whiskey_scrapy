3.0,"Budget Irish.  An ol' reliable bottle.  It's fruity, and slightly sweet.  It is smooth without being altogether boring.  It's not pretentious.  It just is what it is.  It reminds me of a light pear and apricot brandy.  A fine affordable, available, no-nonsense pour with a crisp refreshing finish.  I like it neat in a chilled glass, on a spring evening."
3.5,Not a big fan of Irish whiskys on the nose. But the taste is a smooth vanilla and quite decent. Short and sweet finish.

3.0,"It is a shame that after 300+ whiskies i have never tried before any Bushmills, maybe the most iconic irish whiskey (maybe Jameson is more iconic); but is more of a shame that it is so bad, because even if it is a blend (allegedly), it sure feels only as if it were a grain whisky.

Bottled at 40% abv. Pale straw color.

On the nose is not very enjoyable due to a strong initial alcohol note (well, it is a $22 bottle), who then develops some grain whiskey aromas: Wine white, Apple juice, Tobbaco, Dim milk chocolate note.

On the palate it is almost a single grain. Nothing bad if you like this type of whiskies, just not my cup of tea. Main notes are Corn, dry grass and I can bet the mashbill also has rye because it has that rye spicyness. Very creamy as all grain whiskies are.

Aftertaste is medium long with rye spicyness.

Overall i give this classic dram a  63 over 100, not what i expected at all."

2.0,It's a marathon not a race. Original at one time but more so liquid encouragement. Can be an all nighter. Think? Wedding Dance floor.

3.0,"Nose - pear, green apple, honey, banana, white wine, grape, lemon zest, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - butterscotch, creamy vanilla, honey, floral notes, moderate burn of a young whiskey, finishing short with fading sweetness and a prickly ethanol taste."
3.25,"노즈: 서양배와 옅은 꿀물, 그리고 가까이 갈수록 강하게 스치는 흰빵의 향
맛: 옅은 과실맛, 견과류의 고소한맛, 맛이 전반적으로 옅음
피니쉬: 옅은 오크 스파이스, 살짝 단맛 피니쉬가 길진 않음"

2.0,"Nose: Sweet honey. Bright citrus fruits and apples. Some light malt. Flowery aroma.

Palate: Slightly oily feel. Buttered biscuit. Fruity and sweet. A citrusy tart taste. Somewhat malty.

Finish: Medium. Malt lingering. Slight tang and waves of citrus.

Overall Thoughts: Never been a fan of Bushmills. It’s not the worst whiskey in the world but it’s never my first choice. It’s got enough flavor to please someone just looking for a simple glass of whiskey but I would never say this is impressive by any means."
