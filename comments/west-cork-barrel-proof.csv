null,"Smooth and refreshing, with much different notes than your run-of-the-mill  Irish cask. The Bourbon notes nicely accent the heat of this barrel-proof selection. Clean nose, smooth palate, mild burn on the finish"
4.0,Nose is sweet and sour. Taste is rich with a nice bitter finish.  Sweetness stays throughout and lingers after the finish.  It's a short finish for such a high proof.
4.5,"Nose: orange creamsicle, white grapes, butter biscuit, vanilla, heavy tulip / lavender.

Taste: Butter biscuit, orange but not the deep orange of red breast, vanilla ice cream, shortbread cookies, heavy grass / hay, lavender, tulips, honey, dense southern biscuits, almost a little licorice, parsley, basil, ginger, spearmint"

So, it's been a bit of a rough weekend.  I'm coming off of working the night shift and then I had the displeasure of picking up a 24-hour bug that has kept me couch bound, left debating the merits of old vs new game show hosts.  I mean, come on, do I really need Bob Barker reminding me daily to mutilate my cat's reproductive organs?  Yes, yes I do.

I need a drink.  Something strong.  

My cat eyes me ominously just beyond arms reach, but still stretches her back leg high to clean herself.  Ugh, West Cork take me away...

So, I have this bottle of a limited release whiskey from Irish distillery, West Cork.  This one is a barrel strength offering, ironically called Barrel Proof, that's limited to 4,800 bottles and comes in a whopping 124 proof.  I obtained it from the Virginia ABC online store for a very respectable $55.

It's pale yellow and doesn't give up any leg action (unlike my cat) after a swirl in a dirty Glencairn glass.  It's dirty because I'm drinking Irish whiskey and I know that's how they'd expect me to drink it (No Apologies to those offended).

The nose is oak and sweet fruit.  It'll burn a bit if you inhale too deeply.  That first sip burns so good.  If there's any bacterial virus left in my stomach it's about to be fried, of that I'm sure.  There's a bit of citrus peel as it leaves the tongue, but it's mostly heat and oak.  It's a 1/3 malt, 2/3 grain blend that was finished in ex-bourbon barrels so it is on the smoother side.  The finish isn't as long as you'd expect, either.  It's quite smooth for such a high proof.  An American bourbon with this proof level would be burning like crazy, but this isn't.  It's enjoyable.

I do apologize to West Cork a bit for this review:  grooming cats and stomach viruses aren't expected or even warranted in a review of their product, but dammit, that's the state I'm in so I have to run with it.

I've had 2 West Cork's now and both are solid as hell.  They are maybe the best Irish whiskies I've had to date.  They are independently owned so that's a great reason to support them, too.  If you see a bottle, buy it.  Support the little guy once in awhile.  4 solid stars.  Cheers, bros."
