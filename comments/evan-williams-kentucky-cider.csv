2.0,"Neither a true cider nor a real whiskey, this saccharine concoction is the Hallmark Christmas Movie of wintry adult beverages— a low-budget imitation that tries to pour on sickening sweetness to make up for its abysmal quality.  Notes of Robitussin and corn syrup give way to a potpourri of artificial fall flavorings on the finish that make you long for a tall glass of water to wash away the regret.  The frustratingly low proof further removes any reason for this to exist.  Save your money and buy a couple of 6-packs of actual hard cider."

2.0,"An interesting little concoction. If you're looking for an actual whiskey, then avoid this. If you're looking for something novel to drink around the winter holidays, then this is the ticket. Be warned, the cider flavor is not like an Angry Orchard or WoodChuck. It's more like that old-style cider with a lot of spice. Tastes best hot on a ridiculously cold day."
