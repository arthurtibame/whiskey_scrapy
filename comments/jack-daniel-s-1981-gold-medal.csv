2.5,"So, I bought this bottle thirteen years ago, back when I thought JD was great and Crown Royal was the best whiskey available. Ignorance was bliss.
Now that I just tasted JD no. 7 again, I thought it would be a good time to revisit this one.
The nose is bananas and oak just like no. 7, the palate is not quite smooth with some muted oakiness, the finish, not too pleasant with some harsh tones and bitterness. At least the bottle is cool looking."

3.0,Overall a good whiskey but not for the money. Too boozy on the nose and flavor wise. Needs a couple drops of water.
