3.0,"Sampled this at ABC. Not too bad. Update: I received a bottle for Christmas. This is a little on the sweet side, but it's drinkable. Nice vanilla and pretty smooth. I'd give it a 3.5"

5.0,I'll admit that I'm not a big whiskey fan because it normally feels strong enough to peel paint off a wall but this whiskey was actually pretty smooth. My wife even likes it.  Good job a Gentlemen.

3.0,"Smooth and easy drinking with caramel, vanilla and corn sweetness. A soft gentle hint of baking spices lingers before a short finish. Definitely better than I thought it’d be. It is sweet but not overly sweet like the other reviews make it out to be. It does the job it’s meant to do. It’s a whiskey you can chug at the club without a burn to hold you back, but still enjoy the taste of if you take the time. It’s worth a try. $50 in Ontario."

Glad it was on the 1/2 price sale table"

4.75,"Very interesting item, here. The appearance is unusually dark amber, making the drinker think that there could possibly be some coloring added. In any case, the aroma is of very deep, heavily-charred oak (MGP of Indiana's alligator char?), vanilla, and dried fruit cake fruit. The taste is of those elements, with sweet corn and rye spice. Mouthfeel is low medium, and VB finishes moderately short. Some are saying that it is flavored, but I am honestly not detecting that. RJT"

0.25,This roasted pile of garbage should be rated well below zero but the app will only let me rate it .25. I am pretty sure I have come up with a case of Mexican crabs.
2.0,Carmelized honey on the nose and tongue. Not nearly as smooth as promised. Good thing the bottle was 50% off.

2.5,"You've been running from the zombies for two weeks. You stumble across an abandoned vehicle that conveniently contains a bottle of this. Now you have a decision to make. Bottle of booze, or those extra bullets. Be smart..

Surprisingly it was pretty smooth. But don't be fooled; it's not truly special."

2.0,"This is a weird one. There has to be some added sweetener in here, because it’s a lot more sugary than expected. Both the nose and palate have the same quality: caramel corn. Sugary caramel on popcorn. A touch of charred wood comes in on the finish, as well as a dusty, papery taste. It’s not bad I guess? I admit I was sold by the bottle, but I feel it’s underwhelming for the price. A sweetened, <4yr old blended whiskey for $40 bucks. It’s not terrible but I won’t bother with it again."
