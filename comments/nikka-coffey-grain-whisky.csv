3.75,Dripping with caramel popcorn perfect neat good standby. Could use a cold stone.
4.0,"This is an interesting one in that it's a grain spirit (corn) instead of malted barley.  Almost like a Japanese take on bourbon.

Nose: Heavy vanilla, honey, lemon peel, and some background notes of corn sweetness, hay, and bread dough.

Flavor: Sweet vanilla custard all the way!  Uncomplicated but I like the clear flavors coming through.

Finish:  More sweet vanilla and honey but some oak transitioning to a dry slightly tannic finish.  Just a hair nutty as well.

Very uncomplicated and not at all challenging but sweet and delicious.  More of an after dinner dessert type drink for me than something I want to sip with a burger.  Regardless I'm a fan."

5.0,"Sweet vanilla comes out on top, with undertones of cinnamon sugar and young oak. Incredibly smooth, pleasantly sweet, and not too complex for a daily dram."

4.0,Very nice whisky with a hint of smoke at the end. Very nice pour. One of my favorites along with Weller Special Reserve and Russels Reserve. Try it if you find it!
4.5,"Lovely grain whisky, different from most with less sweetness and more of a nutty, earthy taste. Delicious"

4.0,"Nose is caramel popcorn and vanilla

Palate is light and sweet with sweet caramel

Finish is short and a little bit of spice at the end

It’s a great single grain. Probably my favourite to date. But it does lack depth but makes for an easy go to whisky instead of say a bourbon"

4.5,Vanilla with honey on the nose and caramelized green apple on the taste with a light finish. This is a 45% ABV not a 40% which is indicated on the description.

4.5,"Pretty unassuming nose, light and caramel notes. First sense from the taste is a thin feel, but then opens up real nice, sweet vanilla cake and biscuits overwhelm. Very pleasant finish where the vanilla sticks around while a woody taste rises a bit."
4.0,Highly enjoyable and aromatic. Not heavy but superbly balanced. Better than the malt version. Somehow more honeyed/floral.

5.0,"Nose: vanilla+acetone, ripe apples, honey
Palate: huge evolution of flavors. Starts with apple and green tea, then into swell of toasted cereal notes and light smoke, finished with light honey. Acclimated to the grainy/cereal notes, later sips we're more tea and fruit.
Finish: long, mild white pepper, light honey"
4.0,"This was totally unique compared with my experience with whiskey so far. The nose was had a heavy aroma of over ripened bananas. The palate was fruity with citrus with an ethanol mouth feel, but in a good way. I would buy again."
2.75,"Lots of ethanol. Oaky spice, a little pear, some corn sweetness, honey. It's fine, but too much ethanol for its price. Won't buy."

4.0,"I got to say that i love most Nikka Whiskies, and even if this is a very pleasant dram, when talking about scoring this ""aqua vitae"" i got to say it struggled to achieve the 4 stars. 

Bottled at 45%abv a bit higher for a commercial grain whisky, nice ambar color. 

On the nose, it is where it struggles the most. Without been off putting, the aromas are nice, but nothing too special. Vanilla; Pepper, Grain butter, pastry chocolate, Cream. There is this vanilla ice cream with dulce de leche mixture.
Vanilla ice cream is the most noticeable note here. 

On the palate is very enjoyable, but too straightforward. Vanilla very good. Grainy but very pleasant. Light spiciness and Dulce de leche.

Aftertaste is a little more of the same, bit fairly enjoyable. Chocolate with almonds. Vanilla. Grainy and spicy but pleasant.

Overall, for a grain Whisky, that costs around $60, it is a good dram. 80 over 100."

4.25,Strong nose with grapes. Awesome strong start with vanilla. Great sweet taste that lingers. This and Chita are the best Japanese grains.

4.0,"Sweet sugars on the nose. Light, sweet bourbon notes as soon as it hits the palate. Very pleasant texture. The finish is short with light smoke."
3.0,Didn’t really care for it.  Tried it neat and on the rocks and preferred near.  Overall it was still pretty harsh for the reviews I read.
3.0,"First time trying.  Drank neat.  

Initially thought taste was rather bland, opened up slowly and got sweeter..  Definitely a bright finish but easy to drink."

3.75,"This is a good to go whisky, but due to the shortage from Japan, I've noticed that its getting harder to find in the stores, not to mention that the price is also going up.
   On the nose this is light and sweet.  On the palate i get some vanilla and chocolate, maybe some spices.  The finish is medium lasting with more spice on the back end.
   Overall this is a good drink, but with the prices going up the way they are, there are many other choices for the $65-$75 price range."

4.75,"Bright and sweet with apricot dominant note. Honey ties it together so its very smooth throughout, but there is a bit of a fiery heat at the very end. Subtle wood barrel tones can be found underneath the more dominant flavors."

4.25,Cotton candy with ethanol notes on the nose. Very sweet on the tongue when first sipped.  Reminded me of a peach mead in the mid-taste. Finish is clean and slightly dry. Short aftertaste.

4.25,Yummy sweet vanilla.
3.0,"Had high hopes for this one based on others reviews.   Was somewhat let down, though not a bad whisky at all, the price is a tad high.   On first opening the bottle the higher alcohol content was immediately detectable, and confirmed on first taste.   I tend to prefer to sip over ice however I found it muted the sweeter notes and made the taste somewhat oily and a tad briny.   I also found it more enjoyable after letting it breathe a bit. The nose really opened up.  Initially there is a nice honey vanilla, followed by apricot, leather, and very subtle cinnamon and spice."
3.75,"A bit pricey for what you get. Aroma of sorry bread, with perhaps a hint of the sea. Flavor is buttery, with light vanilla. It tastes a little young for the price, and the screw top was a mistake."

3.75,"Aroma was quite inviting with its sweet, oak, and leather essence. First half of tasting was all that plus hints of vanilla and red hots. Then an avalanche of corn took over the finish which could be a love hate experience for some. At first it was off-putting, but grew on me the more I sipped. Slight boozy bite at the end."
