2.75,Such a light sweet beginning with the ending of straight heat. Love this one.
4.0,"This is for Ace Spirits barrel selection from 2018 I believe. 

First thing the nose reminds me of is high esters Jamaican rum like Hampden's. Nose texture? I think I finally found it. Alcohol attack is subtle for its high proof. These give way for sweetness. Fermented honey and dried figs.

Palate is warm and inviting, marble cake with rum raisins. :then the high proof pounces a bit, leaving a nice afterglow finish of sweet brown sugar with cardamom spice.

For some strange reason this 100% wheat of a dram screams RUM. I would definitely spike my tea with this one."
2.0,Comes in hot and leaves a little sweet. Not my favorite.
2.75,"I'm a fan of anything cask strength because I like the flavor intensity and don't mind a bit of burn on my way to understanding what the distiller was going for. I  think there are a couple of harsh reviews about this whiskey, maybe too harsh. Is it great? No. But it is rather good as an opportunity to taste a full-wheat whiskey and to explore something different.  I agree that it should have stayed in the barrel for a few more years to give the angels a bit more and gain a lot more from the charred oak. Maybe next time."
2.0,"A little hot, a little sweet, and definitely young. The bones of a good whiskey are here, but it will need a few tweaks. I’ll definitely be visiting later editions of this to see how they have progressed!"
1.0,"I tried to give this some time to come around. No substitute for time in the barrell. It’s hot, sweet, and 1 note and that note is youthfulness. I think it’s a good distillate but just not ready."
4.25,"tasted with a piece of ice. 120 proof small batch straight Washington state wheat whiskey aged 3 years. love what this distillery is trying to do. sweet grassy nose. sweet vegital, then leather oak tannin and vanilla, almost to anise flavor in the mouth. quick herbal menthol finish. dont know what other reviewers tasted as ""latex"" (could have been batch specific), but maybe it was this oaky herbal anise element. beautiful golden color and medium-light body. an unusual wheat whiskey, farm to glass, well worth a taste."
0.75,"For anyone who has read my reviews (thank you by the way!) will know that I am a big supporter of craft whiskey and do make a point of trying to seek new ones out. However, I will always review and rate consistently against their mass produced brethren as I am not one that subscribes to over rating for ""potential"". So this brings me to this one. As you can see from the other reviews on here and if you search online most of what's said is positive. So at a discounted rate of $19.99 (versus the $55-$60 SRP) I went ahead and just bought it. Big mistake. 
Honestly, this is one of the very worst Whiskey's I have had all year. The only positive thing I can say about it is it is very easy to drink for 120 proof. However, it has almost no flavor apart from what can only be described as wet latex. The previous reviewer hit the nail on the head. Wet latex with a dash of varnish. Not my cup of tea at all.
However there is a good ending to this story, I did find some Lap 10 for $16.88 yesterday so the Whiskey God's corrected this wrong!! Cheers all!"
3.5,"Smells and tastes like plastic / latex. My first thought was a dentist office after they have shoved the latex gloves hands in your mouth. On second pass I gets notes of a yellow balloon that I'm trying to blow up. Not a big fan of this one, but definitely gets points for uniqueness."
