4.0,"Just opened, so may change with som O2, but initial thoughts are its good. I can taste all the flavors that I want to taste and for the proof (118) it's super smooth. For right now however, it's just a little bland. I am hopeful some time on the shelf with a touch of fresh air will bring out flavors better."

5.0,"This review is for the single barrel 10-year sold by DC's Potomac Wines (currently on sale for $58, a stunning value).  It's bottled at 52.3% ABV, relatively low for a barrel proof bourbon.  Just about everything you want in a bourbon nose is here.  It resembles Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, which I worship, just with the intensity dialed down from 11 to 9.5 or so.  Hanging in the balance are oak, vanilla, toasted coconut, barrel char, cherry, coffee ice cream, and some cologne-esque musk or oiled leather.  There is a lot intermingling here, but it's like the perfect party, where everyone's different personalities mesh together.  The palate progression is interesting.  This bourbon enters stealthily, if that makes any sense.  The first sensations are of a delicate sweetness, with no burn, but then there is a warming rush of oak, tannins, toffee, honey, vanilla, and corn.  It is a rich swirl of flavors, which tails off into a stimulating combination of cinnamon, pepper, and baking spices.  It has a creamy rather than oily texture, and it is so gentle I would have pegged its ABV in the 45% range rather than the 52%+ it actually is.  Belle Meade ends with a lovely coda of oak, butterscotch, rye bread, and cinnamon.  This bourbon is for someone who enjoys a lengthy, languorous finish, but one that doesn't light the tongue, throat, and esophagus on fire.  One of the best bourbons I've had -- the only criticism I have is that it hews pretty close to the traditional/classic bourbon flavor profile, and there aren't many surprising notes along the way.  This is a high-rye bourbon, so imagine Four Roses Single Barrel but with more oak and vanilla flavors and a little extra oomph.  I'd put this at a 96-97 on the Distiller score scale."

4.0,"Excellent. Just excellent. 

Sweet sweet cotton candy nose- 
Tastes of carmel apple cider. Complex and hot- with a lovely burn.

This is NOT a run of the mill bourbon, it is not indecipherable, it’s amazingly unique and you will quickly understand after just a taste why it’s a great addition to your collection."
5.0,"So good. Not only is it a syrupy sweet vanilla/caramel masterpiece, but it's also a veritable cornucopia of fruits, from cherry to apple and maybe even a hint of plum. Solid spicy undertones and some chocolate help create a complex taste.

Usually it's hard to justify bourbon at such a high price point ($66 for this bottle) but the complexity and deliciousness justifies the cost. Well worth it if you can get your hands on it."

3.0,"NOSE - chocolate covered toffee, almost ""candy-bar-esque"", sweet vanilla, light buttery cake

PALATE - sweet and smooth up front with sugary caramels, very quickly followed by a bite of hot cinnamon with another tinge of sweetness, ends with buttered nougat.

FINISH - not much of a finish, if anything a bit creamy towards the end but rather quickly fading"

3.0,Good generic type bourbon. Smooth. Nothing special
4.0,This is better than I thought it would be for the price. Sweet and spicy pretty much sums it up. Medium to long finish. Very pleasant drink without too much spice like an Old Forrester 1920. Nice sipper with some heat at the end but just enough without being too intense. Well worth a grab off the shelf!

112.9 Proof. Private Selection Bounty Hunters
Sweet, peppery, caramel, slight oak bitterness on finish, but expected, and not unwelcome or offensive.  One of the better cask strength single barrels I have discovered."
