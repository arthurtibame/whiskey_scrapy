3.0,"3.3. I liked it... very smooth, no bite, sooooo smooooth.... not a lot of complexity... but would be good for times where you want that.  I wouldn't pass it up if offered."

2.0,Just not a good whiskey in my humble opinion!  Maybe if it was aged longer and not rushed to the market it may be better-I will try again in a couple weeks to be fair to the brand

3.0,Fairly impressed for $20 bottle and it's readily available at my local.

2.25,Light Scotch like nose. Yellow liquid is thin and carries sweetness and some vegetal flavors and very little barrel. The finish is short with a little pepper spice.

0.25,"absolutely the worst ""bourbon"" I have ever tasted. Smells like cheap tequila and tastes worse."

3.25,The nose presents a sweet vanilla note with a smooth palate with hints of fruit.  Mild finish with a touch of butterscotch.
1.0,"Rich gold color

Spicy alcohol aroma 

A bit soapy taste with notes of oak"
0.25,"I am not sure what magical energy I had during my last tasting to actually enjoy this. I don't like being harsh about whiskey usually, but man... this one's rough. A lot of strange vegetal notes on the nose with a hint of uncooked flour. It barely even smells like a whiskey to me, more like a tequila as another reviewer stated. Same flavors carry over into the tasting with a little bit of unpleasant spice on the finish. Diluting it down made it a bit more drinkable, but still very rough."

3.75,"A very young smelling whiskey with beautiful hints of caramel and toasted cereal, almost like a Honey Nut Cheerio. A weird hint of flour also raises in the nose. That same flour-y note comes out in the taste and finish. I may be the only person who's ever ate straight flour and enjoyed it, so this may be a very personal note. It's almost like a cake batter taste. I think I might be going insane. A little water made that flour note stronger but added a bit of oak. I really don't mind it at all, but I might be the only person who enjoys the taste of raw flour."

1.75,"I found this to be quite bland and spicy. Tried neat, then on the rocks twice. It finally became a mixer for me with sprite. 1.75 stars from me only because the price point was so good at only 22$"

2.75,"I found this to be smooth but sweet with hints of almost floral notes. Not for everyone but certainly not ""the worst"""
2.5,"Ehh. It’s bourbon. Bought it because it was on sale, plus the market had an additional coupon for $3 more off. The color is light. Doesn’t have a rich taste by any means. Slight bite to it. Nothing really “special” about it."

null,"I literally couldn't drink this. Never had such a negative reaction to a bourbon before and I don't have especially expensive tastes or anything. I bought it on a whim, knowing nothing about it.

Gave the bottle away after one finger neat."

3.0,"Strong bite, hard to drink."
2.0,"Tasted as part of a flight of Devils River, Breakers Bourbon, Elijah Craig Small Batch, and Bernheim Wheat Whiskey.

Nose:
Popcorn and toasted oak. Fair, no burn, and not overly complex. Seems approachable and young.

Tasting:
Young tasting. Still heavy on popcorn like a white dog. Much more forward on the tongue. Nothing unpleasant, but nothing to write home about. Perhaps a decent entry point for new bourbon drinkers. Wouldn't buy a bottle for my collection."

2.0,Goes in like medicine....very limited smoothness from the aging.  Lacks my favorite aspects of Bourbon...that corn sweetness balanced with the oak smoothness and the kick.  I don't love this....for half the price you can get a bottle of Wild Turkey 80 proof and have a much better experience.
