4.0,"Kind of ""medical"" smell. Not the desinfection kind, but kind of ""harsh medicine"". The taste is surprisingly sweet and rich like with rhubarb pie. There is nice tingling afterburn. I can taste bit of ""sea"" in aftertaste. After a few tastes hints of peat. Overall, the taste is nice, interesting."
