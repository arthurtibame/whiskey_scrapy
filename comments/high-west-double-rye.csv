4.0,"Every time I have a pour I think, “why do I like this so much?” Rye is certainly a lesser traveled whisky road for me, so is it the unfamiliar notes that resonate? Maybe it’s the garden box of herbs & botanicals on the nose? Perhaps the spicy and unusual (for me at least) black licorice/citrus zest/mint/molasses combo on the palate? Whatever it is, the Double Rye is smooth and enjoyable.

Rating: the Distiller score seems about right although I’d probably go 2-3 pts less. No reason why this rye shouldn’t have a spot in any cabinet at a very reasonable $34 (can even be found south of $30 for the bargain hunter). Cheers & enjoy"

3.25,"3.3/5.0 - 2nd generation (house distillate plus MGP.  No 16-yr).

Mint, lemon zest and a hint of soap on the nose.  Gentle with the barest hint of alcohol.

The taste is very light and vegetal.  Herbs.  Characteristic rye cinnamon but the barley is easily identified.  Relatively thin - watery mouthfeel.

Finish is gentle but long, mostly a pleasant cinnamon across the tongue.

Tastes young but not harsh.  Well made and fair at msrp ($30); a value for less (seen as low as $26).  A unique flavor that stands out from the pack."

Taste: Cane sugar, light body, light licorice, menthol, clove, juniper, green and pink peppercorn and general rye herbs..with some sweet oak, leather, touch of smoke, and tartness in the finish. 

This will always be in my cabinet.  It's priced like a daily and tastes like your birthday.  If you like Bulleit Rye, but want a little more of the age and oak, without losing the bright spice, then this is your jam."

Nose: sweet rye, leather, vanilla, anise
Palate: Medium spice, vanilla, caramel, coriander. Rich, complex, sweet, delicious neat. No burn. Wet grass on the second sip, but it doesn't last. Hides the young age well.
Finish: Longer with no burn. Declicious.

I'd probably buy more of this just because it is so affordable. Wish it was higher proof, but this is a great enough neat sipper and should be big enough for most cocktails.  Need a bit more in an OF, though."

Tastewise, I get more rye, cereal, mint, pine, anise, and some vanilla sweetness. Finish is pretty cool with the mint notes. Nice change of pace when you're not in the mood for a sweet whiskey like bourbon or a speyside scotch, but I'm not sure how good a value this is compared to other ryes on the market. 

Update: My second glass of this a few days after my first had more muted flavors than it did the first time. Depending on how the flavor changes as I go through the bottle the score may go down a bit."

That being said, this is a solid offering at a reasonable price (unlike their other whiskeys). If you are deciding between this and Rendezvous Rye (ignoring the $40 price difference) get this one.

4.25,"Last year High West announced a pretty major shift in the make up of this Rye. Historically, this has been a blend of a 2 yr old MGP distilled rye (95% rye and 5% Malted barley) and a 16 yr old rye (53% rye, 37% corn and 10% Malted barley) distilled @ Barton in KY. I have always viewed it as a great value rye worth sipping neat or making a fabulous Manhattan. 
So what was the change? High West replaced the 16 yr old Rye with their own Distillate which is aged for between 4-7 yrs. It has a very unique Mashbill (80% rye and 20% Malted Rye). The 2 yr old rye is retained and makes the base of the new blend (greater than 50%). What's more is that High West makes the bold statement that no change in quality or flavor profile will be noticed! I thought no way that was possible. Then I tasted this year's MidWinter which also included the new Distillate for the first time and was really impressed. Then we saw Whiskey Advocate include it in their annual Top 20 list. Finally, old faithful Costco stocked it and I picked up this bottle for just $29. 
Now in order to ensure you have the new recipe, check the batch # and ensure is starts with a 18. My batch # is 18018 for reference. 
Now that you are well versed with the history, let's move to the tasting!
On the pallette you get those classic and nice MGP rye notes of honey and clove with caramel apples to augment it. Mid pallette show some more spice with a nice botanical/herbal undertone. Finish is medium in length with caramel, clove and mint. All in all it's a really nice pour. Slightly sweeter than the previous iteration but also more complex. 
It's quite an achievement by High West that they can create such complexity whilst losing a 16 yr old component. 
I would say this is the best sub $30 Rye I have had to date. Beats out Rittenhouse BiB and Baby Saz hands down. 
Lovely effort and really worthy of it's inclusion on the WA Top 20 list of 2018. If you like Rye, find a batch starting with 18. You won't be dissapionted!"

It still has the, ""giant hole"" in it's flavor profile that seems to plague most every rye I have tasted, but HW still comes through with some good flavors.  I am a big cinnamon fan and this rye is short on cinnamon and cloves.  It has back of the mouth heat which is much preferable to the front heat that lesser drinks seem to provide.  My rye of choice is the Sazerac 6yr(now NAS).  It is full of cinnamon, has more flavor than HW, and is only $29.  It is not as readily available, but it is a better value.  I would like to try the HW Rendezvous Rye, but it is even pricier.  I understand that rye leaves space in it's profile for mixologist to operate and fill in the blanks, but I much prefer a dram that is more ready to drink."

I’m not a huge fan of rye bread so I kind of always stayed clear of the rye bourbons but I saw an old style bottle of this on clearance and couldn’t resist the urge. There is something about this that just feels right. The rye was obviously  there in the nose but I also got whiffs of what I can only describe as sawdust. The palate was smooth as butter and it wasn’t exactly what I was expecting. The finish to me is where this one shines, that’s where I found the pronounced rye I was looking for, although not at all overpowering.
So glad I took the chance on this one, has really opened up my world to a whole other side of whiskey that I never thought I would enjoy."

I happen to have honey hole that has a shelf full of the “old” stuff but the price has been jacked up to the current Double Rye price so a $15 bump for me but I’ll still pay the extra for this.

The nose has, wait for it... Rye! Also, I pick up cola, anise, corn some baking spices, vanilla and some sweetness.

The palate is light and slightly creamy in texture. There is a good amount of rye, vanilla, slightly dusty barn, and a little sweetness.

The finish is long with lingering rye spice and a slow burn on the sides of tongue and throat. Very nice.

At this point, I wouldn’t consider myself a “rye guy”, but this is nice and enjoyable. 
It doesn’t actually have any corn in it after looking up the mashbills used in this blend, so it’s interesting that corn was a somewhat prominent note that I was picking up."

2.75,"Tasted neat in a glencairn.  About 5 minutes was allowed to pass after the pour for the liquor to rest. The pour is brassy gold with thin sheeting and very little in the way of legs.

The nose is cherry coughdrops, menthol, ethanol, and an almond note reminiscent of amaretto.  There's a sweetness element and an alcohol element and they seem a bit disjointed and perhaps a little thin.

The taste is initially sweet with cherry, vanilla, dill, cloves and mint. The initial sweetness fades quickly to a somewhat dry mid-note that carries a tinge of bitterness and this carries into the beginning of a peppery finish.  This is a spicy rye with a bright, young personality.  

This is an acceptable rye when served neat.  Its definitely not in the class of Pikesville, or even Templeton Good Stuff (the latter being a guilty pleasure of mine when straight, but a bit weak in the knees to go head-to-head in a cocktail)

I find it to be a good candidate for a big rock and casual sipping.  It works very well in a Manhattan, also.  This rye has an affinity for vermouth, in particular in a perfect Manhattan with Noilly Prat rouge and extra dry 50-50. 

This is a good bottle and I'm glad I sampled it.  I got it on sale for $27.99.  It's worth that, but it has some stiff competition.   I probably would take an Old Overholt BiB or a Rittenhouse over this.  I do like this better than OF rye.  

I guess there's enough rye in the $20 to $30 range that this isn't going to be a repeat purchase for me.  It's right near the highest point on the bell curve along with all the other the average players, and that's not quite good enough to get excited about."

I didn't quite sense a blend of flavors... It's kind of like Diet Cola (not those modern zero sugar ones; the old Diet sodas) where it tastes like the original at first, but ends up with that bitter, synthetic flavor at the end. Just making an analogy; not saying MGP Rye is bitter, synthetic, or a bad thing (I do enjoy MGP rye whiskey a lot). I just think the MGP portion may be slightly overwhelming the overall scent and flavors of this whisky."

However, if you look behind it you will get a toasted vanilla woodiness and traditional rye spice/sassafras flavor. The finish lingers, there is some oil here. It's the pine needles from the gin still, along with the sassafras or black licorice sweetness. I did find a tad of new leather every once in awhile as well. After a few minutes it all gets rounded up with the menthol I get from a Lagavulin. For the price this is an excellent whisky for enthusiastic drammers.
