5.0,"Color is a crisp golden amber. Legs are notably thick and viscous, creating a nice ring around the glass. Nose is incredibly unique for a bourbon; very soft and smooth with complex sweetness. Starts with vanilla and cherry then opens up to fruity pears and bread. Palate is exceptionally smooth and hits with sweet vanilla mixed with smoky oak. Nose has shifted to carmely orange with a palate more fruity, demonstrating the complexity of this bourbon. A fantastic whiskey full of pleasant surprises makes for an enjoyable drink every single sip."
5.0,White pepper. Super smooth. One of my favorites I’ve ever had. Would have bought a bottle for sure but not $125
4.5,"Wow! Anise and vanilla with a hint of oak. Really complex and interesting. Not a traditional single barrel flavor in bourbon, but that’s why it’s good! Make this a second pour after a traditional SB bourbon!"
