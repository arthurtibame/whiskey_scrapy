4.5,Truly remarkable.  Edged out 2018 GTS for the top spot and blew away the 2018 WLW.  Did not get the opportunity to try ER or Saz.

4.75,"Believe the hype. This rye opens up with strong sweet aroma then gives way to a bold, full flavor. Very smooth, not to oily. Best whiskey I’ve had."
4.5,Sweetness through and through. Red hots and brown sugar dominant the flavor. There is very little burn for a 128 proof. One of my favorites.
5.0,$8/oz. always a favourite
5.0,"Heavy oak nose and bold rich taste.  This is the single best whiskey I’ve had. 
Wow!"
4.25,"Rested 10 mins In Glencairn 

Nose: orange, caramel, spicy heat, subtle briny note underpinning sweeter notes
Palate: honey, caramel, almond, and leather
Finish: amazing spicy tail filled with flavors of orange peel and caramel"
4.5,"Nose (4.0):  Nose is a little more subtle then I would have liked.  Excellent aromas of candied apples, spice, and some dark chocolate.

Palate (4.5):  Exceptional balance.  The flavors on the nose carry forward on the palate and are in excellent harmony.  The spice builds but doesnt interupt what is going on here.  So smooth for the higher proof makes it remarkable.

Finish (4.5):  Finishes as it started with subtle notes of cocoa and a delightful oak added on.  Very sophisticated rye."

4.0,Warms you up quickly. I pick up vanilla and baking spices on the nose. Light on the tongue then the spice and heat rush in. Warm finish that lasts. Added a tsp of water and let it sit for a few minutes. After letting it sit I pick up more fruit and chocolate on the nose. Rich on the tongue. Hints of fruit and buttered toast. Baking spices and heat.

3.75,"Nose: salty, mossy, caramel, light and airy like going to the beach

Body: moderate to full

Palate: spicy, light caramel, hot chocolate

Finish: long

Note: good not outstanding more in line with old rip van winkle"
4.75,Good nose. Not overpowering. Smells sweet. Not much alcohol despite proof.  Sweet and smooth candy on the palate that goes into a spicy finish that is so long. Very very good.
4.25,Damn it’s spicy but good!
5.0,"Fiery and hot, even with water, with lots of rye spice.  With a bit of water, very rich, long lasting vanilla, a hint of tobacco maybe?  Nice sweetness, brown sugar and butter flavor, which contrasts nicely with the vanilla.  Kind of like good chocolate chip cookie dough, sans chips, but hot from the rye.  It has a luxurious, full mouth feel - it really is buttery.

I'd say drink it really slow, let it rest 10-15 minutes before really digging into it.  The flavors open up more with time.


I hit the jackpot with this one.  This virtually jumps to the top of my favorite whiskey list, and I know it might be a long time before a bottle like this crosses my path again."
5.0,"I first tried THH on NYE 2018 at the House of Bourbon in New Orleans. Simply put...it was the best whiskey of any kind I’d ever tasted. I chalked it up to the moment but it stuck in my mind until I finally stumbled across a bottle for sale.

I stand by my original impression...Pappy 15, Lot B, GTS, even the exalted BTAC Saz 18 y.o... you name it...they all fall under the bar that THH has set according to my tastes.

If there is something better out there I surely can’t afford it. Five stars."
5.0,All time favorite. I turn off all taste buds and just become absorbed in the moment. Had '17 and '18 and i will forever seek it out.

5.0,"Absolutely amazing.  Spicy rye notes with a bit of fruit.  Wood and tobacco, cinnamon, alcohol burn.  Vanilla.  Long, lingering finish- dry wood, cinnamon, rye spice.

Flavors coat the mouth and linger throughout the finish.

Wood char and even some smokiness emerge very late"

4.5,"Flight of WLW, GTS, THH 2018 for $32!"
4.5,"Really enjoyed my neat pour of this one.  Thick, dark, and really really viscous.  A good balance of sweet and savory.

Haven’t had either before and in name alone I couldn’t remember whether this BTAC one was the old but low proof or younger barrel proof. The way it drank I guessed 100% wrong.  Very low ethanol, could not have told you this was the high proof stuff.  Main clue was should have been how thick and viscous it was.  Really nice cinnamon, oak, and hints of butterscotch.  

At first blush, this is a clear new favorite barely legal rye... sort of like pikesville if it were twice as thick.  Didn’t double check if that’s accurate on the mashbill, but that’s what I’m tasting.  Not as complex as some, but knows what it is and delivers 100% on that.  Probably not worth hunting (what is really?) but enjoy if you can try some."

3.5,"This is the one Whiskey in the BTAC that I had not yet sampled. The main reason why is anytime it was available so we're the rest of the collection and honestly they seemed far more enticing. So this time this and the Saz 18 were available and since I already had a pour of the Saz I pulled the trigger on this one! Let's dive into the notes:

As it enters you are hit with big caramel and orange peel notes which quickly move to rye spice that then becomes a dash of pepper. The alcohol is also very present and a bit too strong. As we move to the mid palette clove and cocoa appear leading to a big spice and slight butterscotch finish. The finish is fairly long. After 2 sips I added a splash of water and it did tame the heat whilst the profile held up. 

For me I honestly don't get the hype around this release. Yes its a very good barrel proof rye. However, I personally would rather drink any other BTAC Whiskey over it. I honestly don't think it's in the same ballpark as Michters Rye BR or even the Whistlepig 10 SiB BP. 

Worth a pour? Sure. Hunt a bottle? Not for me. Better Ryes out there that are attainable for far less. 

Cheers all!"

4.75,"The color is a bright golden amber, heavily coating the glass. The nose is full of sweet and floral rye, with vanilla, soft sugar and a grassiness finishing it off. The palate immediately hits you with dry and spicy rye, that is at the same time very rich with vanilla and a slight bit of oak. It is a very simple palate, but all comes together as a big bundle of flavor that lingers in the mouth keeping it warm for a very long and wonderful finish."
