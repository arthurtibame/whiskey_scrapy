3.5,"Few is one of the rare micro distillers that not only uses their own Distillate, but it's up to the same quality of the Kentucky big boys. I have enjoyed all their expressions and this one is no different. Up front you get cereal, honey and brown sugar. This then moves to orange peel and clove. You then get a big rye and cinnamon driven finish that lingers! Nice hug to boot. Nice pour and I would happily buy a bottle of this."
