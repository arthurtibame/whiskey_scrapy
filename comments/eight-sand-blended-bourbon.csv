3.75,More of a mixer then on the rocks
3.0,"Nose: mgp spice, vanilla, charcoal, more ethanol than expected for 88p
Palate: sweet, thin, butterscotch 
Finish: short with late burn, touch of mint"
3.5,"Taste:  Neat in glen cairn

Nose: (3) Initially alot of ethanol on the nose but then it disappears.  Lots of vanilla and spice.  Some younger wood notes.  Reminescent of a wood shop but in a good sort of your grandpa is building something by hand in the shop and you are helping him out type of way.  Nose is a bit young.  

Palate (3.75):  Spice and vanilla forward with cinnamon like red-hot candies.  Offers a sweetness but not cloyingly or artificial.  Not bad, the palate is better than the nose.  Addition of water helped the cinnamon settle down a little and opened up some sweet cherry.

Finish (3.5):  A bit thin and dry is my biggest complaint.  Stays woody on the mid palate.  The saw dust from grandpa's woodshop takes over a bit.  Oak blooms with a warming finish that seems better than its proof.

Overall:  I would have liked to see MGP pick one bourbon, give it time in the barrel, and come up with a bourbon barrel proof offering like they did with the rye Rossville Union which I very much enjoyed. I think the blending of some older whiskeys with younger ones made this a tad disjointed.  It plays a bit young and woody on the back end, but the pieces for a great one are all there, just a little underdeveloped and maybe not enough mesh.  I would not kick it off the shelf at the 29/bottle price because it is a quality juice and will be nice for sipping or mixing.  The dry finish and the ""sand"" in the name though will bring a bit of comparison when sipping with bourbon friends.  Five stars for the old timey bottle and steam train reference.  Reminds me of the show ""Hell on Wheels."""
4.25,"Brown sugar and spice on the nose. Slightly spicy at first, very little burn to it, quickly switching to cinnamon and brown sugar. Thoroughly enjoyed it. No buyers remorse on this one."

3.75,It’s got great flavor with a little burn on the back side. But very enjoyable for the price.

3.25,Great flavor for the price.  Full and not lacking in the palate or finish.  Leaves you wanting another sip
5.0,"The revue is spot on. I would add perfection in what it is great middle of the road,and so smooth. Just a great bourbon to introduce a young  person onto the appreciation of whiskey so their pallet us not steam rolled by sweetness or acid notes"

3.75,"This isn’t anything that’s going to WOW you, but it is a great daily drinker and at $28 I’m in! Nice vanilla, caramel, and a light spice at the end."
2.0,"N: Sweet corn very faint
P: Vanilla and spice
F: Quick heat and then nothing"
4.5,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Classic MGP nose and very fragrant for only 88 proof.  Dessert flavors with a hint of oak and pepper.  Vanilla, light caramel and butterscotch.  Hint of berries and cream.

Smooth and almost creamy mouth feel.  Light texture but oily too.  Not much flavor on the tongue.  Light sweetness but otherwise muted, some barrel spice and vanilla.  The taste is delicious and very bright and sweet.  Vanilla and light caramel.  Light, milky chocolate on the legs.

It’s 88 proof and $30.  Can’t lose sight of that.  With that in mind, the oily thick texture and smooth dessert qualities are amazing. It’s delicious, light MGP.  I can see myself reaching for this as a great everyday sipper when I am just in the mood for dessert bourbon."
3.25,Spicy and sweet but seperately.. not balanced. A decent bourbon but would not buy a bottle.
3.25,Sweet start. A little bit of heat on back end. Vanilla and cinnamon

2.25,Did not like this at all. Bouquet is rubbing alcohol and so is the taste. Best used as a mixer. I bought this on a recommendation while at the liquor store as a “best bargain buy” but I’d take some of the name brand budgets over this one in a heartbeat.

3.5,"This is a bit surprising.  Very light Carmel oaky nose.  Light enjoyable taste.  One of the better under $30 bottles I’ve had.  
Seriously..... buy one."
