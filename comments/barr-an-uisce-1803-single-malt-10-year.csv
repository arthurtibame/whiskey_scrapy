5.0,Received as a gift so I can’t speak to the price. The sweet smoothness of Irish whiskey meets the peppery bite of Kentucky bourbon. Served neat following a savory meal such as burgers or steak is a real winner. Add a spoonful of water to really release full range of flavor.

4.0,"Tried this at Austin’s Seven Grand during a May the 4th themed whiskey night. And while I found it a bit heavy on the wood-shavings flavor, I quite enjoyed it nonetheless.

Worth a try."
