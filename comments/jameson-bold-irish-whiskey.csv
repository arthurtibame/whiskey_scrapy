4.0,"My second review on Jameson ""Deconstructed Series"", this time is for their ""Bold"" expression. I actually expected this one to be the worst one of the three, since ""Round"" was so good and ""Lively"" described itself as ""elegant and Floral, with citrusy lightness, like a soft breeze"". Well let me tell you a spoiler, that one was the only one i did not like; and, this ""Bold"" was quite decent.

Aroma is normal, goes from very dim to ""nice"" after a couple of minutes. Fresh fields,  Grain whiskey and some Alcohol note is the first you get.

Then, there is a cheap citrusness to it, like lemon or lime. Mostly spicy like strong black pepper. Full spicy on the nose. Waiting 5 minutes will release some cotton or sugar note
Let it breath, It will release some sweeter notes like Orange cough syrup. Cinnamon and apples. Whole aroma feels dim and unclear; mostly spicy.
Bubble gum aroma will appear after two sips.

On the palate you find this inmidiate spice bomb, not unpleasant or overpowering. Chilli and cinammon. Doesn't feel grainy at all. Not oily nor thick, just spicy.

Aftertaste, as the ""Round"" expression, is amazing. Nice clean bubble gum finish. It is exactly bubble gum with cinnamon. Aftertaste is proven the best part of this  series (i thought that before having the ""Lively"" one). Actually pretty good. The bubble gum note is exactly the one you find in bubble tape. Medium long.

Overall aftertaste makes this spicy dram quite interesting, it is just a normal dram, but that finish pays the bottle. 80 over 100."
