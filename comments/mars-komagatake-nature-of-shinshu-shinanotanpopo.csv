4.25,"I love the Komagatake series from Mars. The differences between each variant are clear and interesting, but they maintain a good cohesion between them that allow them to be indented as a set. Precision whiskey crafting, so much fun to taste and compare.

(and a slightly higher rating fir this one as it's my favourite of the three)"

5.0,"A blend of 20 year old sherry cask whisky from before Shinshu distillery closed with 3-6 year make from reopening. This is such a good dram with notes of berries, figs, honey, caramel, floral notes, and whisps of peat on the finish."
