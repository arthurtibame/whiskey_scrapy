5.0,"First impression is how pretty this whiskey is being a dark and firey amber that coats the glass like a curtain when given a gentle swirl. The nose is a perfect mix of dried fruit, fresh oak, sweet pipe tobacco, butter and vanilla, with notes of brown sugar and fall baking spices mixing in and out. Each time you come back to it you are always getting a different element of the nose. The palate is very dry but also very rich with a butteryness that fills the mouth balanced by dry fruit, while it’s spiciness tingles all corners of the mouth. Oak, tobacco, brown sugar and rye round off the palate, each flavor being in a perfect proportion. The finish is long with a lingering spiciness from baking spices along with earthy rye and tobacco, while all of the creamy and sweet element melt together and fade long and gently. If you’re not careful it’s high proof will bite you, but if you take your time with it you would be hard pressed to guess that it is over 133 proof. It is a masterful blend."
5.0,"Ok now don't all yell at me in unison when I make this statement but this is one of the very best Whiskeys I have ever tasted. Coming with a heavy price tag (SRP $249) and being a blend of ""finest"" Canadian and American Whiskeys I like most was extremely skeptical. Fox's has had this bottle for 2+ months and not sold a pour. At $35 a pour (typically right around 2oz) I wasn't pulling the trigger. Today it was offered to me for $25 and I decided why the heck not!

Even at the almost 134 proof this stuff is lovely neat. Incredibly rich and complex. It leads with Nutmeg and clove with maple and butterscotch laced in there.. then we got orange marmalade,  cocoa nibs, raisins and mixed nuts. Finish is ridiculous with big oak intertwined with baking spices and toffee. It just doesn't quit. I added a few drops of water and that amplifies the notes and takes the heat a bit. 

Any rye lover who wants to splurge, definitely look this one up. To be honest anyone who appreciates high proof Bourbon or Rye would really enjoy this. Cheers All!"
