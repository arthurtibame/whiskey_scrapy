4.0,An excellent example of Canadian rye for an even better price. This has become my favourite value-rye. I haven't been without a bottle since I discovered it.

3.0,"The nose is light, a little sweet. It is smooth drinking, but young so the first few sips are a little raw. Spicy, citrus and some sweet honey maybe. Really fantastic for it's price point and good enough to sip straight. I find it opens up a bit on ice."
