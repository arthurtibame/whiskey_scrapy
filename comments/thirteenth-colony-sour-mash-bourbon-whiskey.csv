4.25,"I am finally able to review the very solid full-flavored Bourbon. This is not one of the subtle complex bourbons on the market it is an in your face I dare you to take another sip bourbon. That is not to say it is bad it is very good but it is strong. The nose is sweet vanilla and a light spice that goes into the body where the full flavor explodes onto your palate. I tasted a sweetness like brown sugar or caramel and some of the heat from the alcohol but it is ok it is expected. I went to the web site and it says it is a ""wheated"" bourbon and it is not like any wheater I have ever had but it is not a bad thing. The Bourbon makes an outstanding Old Fashioned as the flavor really compliments the bitters and orange peel in my OF. Is this the best bourbon for the price no it is not. Is it a very solid that shows that not all wheated bourbons are smooth sippers yes it does. I believe that it would be interesting if it were in the barrel for a few more years but this is very good ""I had a rough day and I need a drink of something to make me get over it"". This is your drink. It is not easy to find and it runs around $40 a bottle but it is worth trying in my humble opinion. Enjoy.  Over the Memorial Day weekend, this won a blind taste test between Russell Reserve, Very Old Barton BiB, and Henry McKenna BiB.  I upped the score.  This is a very good bold bourbon."
