4.25,A smooth robust whiskey. I’m new to the hobby and this is so far my favorite out of the couple of bottles I’ve gone through.
4.75,One of the best American whiskey's on the market.  The nose is lit up with herbs and cinnamon toast.  The palate reminds me of licorice.   The finish continues to tease the senses.
