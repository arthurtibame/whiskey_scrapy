4.25,"This really gives your nose a tickle! Strong notes of dried fruit from the port casks comes through. There is a slight note of aniseed - although some disagree. As well as orange peel. 

On the palate, there is an initial sweetness before the alcohol kicks in. Once this dies off there is a creamy vanilla taste which slowly turns to a 'sticky' almost bitter (but pleasent finish)."

5.0,"Australian Single Malt Whisky Tasting (Part 2), The Oak Barrel, Sydney 17 January 2020, Whisky #5

Nose: Sweet and full, malty, leathery with restrained spices including cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Honey and vanilla make an appearance together with dusky oranges, dried apricots, butterscotch syrup and light oak, but it is primarily a rich and multi-faceted malty nose with a tinge of smoke.

Palate: An arrival of big malty fullness with a texture that is oily and encompassing. The development brings out ginger snap biscuits, Christmas cake, fresh red apples, creme caramel, dried dates, dried figs and butterscotch pastry. There is a minute whisper of elusive smoke.

Finish: Long. Toffee cereal flavours resound into a warm citrus aftertaste.

Surprisingly, this is not a particularly complex whisky with manifold facets. Rather it is straightforward but each element of the profile has great depth. It is a very satisfying, intense and rewarding whisky. Water adds an extra spectrum and incredibly seems to add creaminess and depth rather than diluting the experience. The fruity notes become lighter and fresher, the creaminess is more elegant, the spice notes more sharply defined and the smoke note slightly amplified. It can accept considerable dilution without stress.

Bill Lark is the godfather of Australian whisky. Without his activity in the 1990s to change state and federal legislation there would be no Australian whisky, rum or gin industry as it currently exists. The fact that he also found time to create spirits of impeccable quality is further testament to his energy and talent, if any were needed.

Lark Cask Strength Single Malt is released occasionally by Lark Distillery in various forms. It changes with each batch and the casking has included first-fill ex-bourbon, sherry and port barrels in various combinations and sizes. Maturation is sometimes reversed from the usual approach, starting with a fortified wine cask and finishing in ex-bourbon. The age and strength of the batches also varies - it's released ""when and as it's ready"" and it has appeared in a variety of bottle shapes with different labels over the years, in 200, 500 and 700ml sizes.

This is a stunning whisky and I have no hesitation in rating it at 5-stars (in my tasting journal I gave it 92/100). It's a desert island dram and it's a pleasure to make it my 600th review on Distiller.

""Outstanding"" : 5 stars"
