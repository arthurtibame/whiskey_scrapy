An amazing distillery and their 12 year rye is an absolute treat if you're in the right mood. Not really something I'd drink everyday (even if I could)... But if you get the chance, don't pass it up. The 10 year edition is my absolute favorite rye and wish it was up here so I could petition for a 6th star option."

Sweet and spicy rye, a touch flora (but that may have been the apricot jam on the peanut butter wings). Solid whiskey - going to need a few more samples before I can tease out the details. ;)"

A splash of water opens up more grains and gives it a longer finish. The heat comes on late with a nice, lingering warmth. Prefer it neat. Really appreciate the grass and muddy tones that way."

4.0,"I guess you'd need to like the sweetness of rye whiskey to really appreciate this one.  I've lately become greatly enamored of single malt Scotch, and sincerely appreciate the mildness of the taste and the subtlety of the finish, including the peaty varieties of Scotch whisky.  My kids permitted me a taste of this very exclusive offering and I agree that it goes down with a good deal of character.  I'm no expert, but there's something much more gentle in the clarity of Scotch versus the candy-like taste of rye whiskey."
