null,"Here’s the deal (correct me if I’m wrong) I have Corry, and Oogie- they are both fantastic and different enough to stand on their own. However, I recently cracked open a few bottles of grooves and kelpie and I feel like I’m basically tasting some sort of reconnoitering of their same NAS whiskey with new names and marketing- I think my bitch is that because of the lack of age statements I’m only deciphering char and vatting for most new ardbegs- not aging... it feels kinda like I’m eating at lunch Buffett where they serve the same 5 things daily - but just mix it together In different amounts and put a differ label on it.. somebody please tell me otherwise."

I’m sure there are many who can describe this whisky infinity better than I, so I’ll defer to those people.

I thoroughly enjoyed the peat and leather vibe to this edition."

4.0,Extremely smooth. Not heavy peat but it’s in there. And a ton of barrel. Many other things going on with different food pairings
5.0,Up front was thick and sweet. Reminding of a sweet rum. Smooth all the way through. Finished with pretty standard Ardbeg peat. Perhaps a little light on peat. Overall very pleasing.

5.0,"Thanks to @Dreaming-of-Islay for the pour!  I can’t give Ardbeg anything less than 4 stars.  Just can’t.  In fact, they can mature whisky in barrels that previously held snail snot, and I’m sure we all would be raving about it here.  So...I remember having the Committee version of this some time back...this one here is the same, just pulls its punches a wee bit.  But, hell...it’s Ardbeg.  Even if it pulls its punches, you’re still gonna feel it as if Mike Tyson just gave you an uppercut.  Peat and orchard fruits galore here.  Green apples, bonfire, clotted cream.  It’s Ardbeg...it’s good.  Thanks @Dreaming-of-Islay for the sample!"

4.25,"info: il s'agit de la bouteille de célébration du Ardbeg day 2018. Celle-ci se veut être une expression plus extravagante que ce que la gamme Ardbeg nous offres habituellement. En effet, ce scotch de Islay est vieilli en fût de vin rouge dit bousiné soit des fûts si intensément brulés que le bois à la surface des douelles est strié de grosses rainures, des « grooves » en anglais.

Au nez: Gros caramel épais, mélasse sucré et fumé de viande beef jerky salé de style Ardbeg. Des notes d'herbes ou d'algues. Des notes florales ou de lavande. Très complexe au nez.

En bouche: Cerise et smoke meat. Fumé de feu de camp et algue verte. Marin et sucré. Le caramel est la mais on passe vite à autre chose. Rond, belle texture épaisse et huileuse. Bel équilibre sur son 46% selon moi juste parfait en intensité aromatique; je m'en voudrais de diluer un si parfait équilibre avec une goutte d'eau.

Final: Longue et belle. Sur la viande fumé et le sucre. Vraiment, l'image du smoke meat avec une sauce bbq sucré à la cerise me reste en tête et est probablement ce qui résume le mieux ce scotch. 

Overall: ooooh que j'aime ça! différent mais habile. J'aime Ardbeg de façon général mais je reste la tête froide lorsque j'évalue. 180$ CAD en SAQ pour cette bouteille, c'est dire que l'on paie pour l'exclusivité de ce produit plus que ce qu'il vaut vraiment en qualité. Pas que je trouve le produit est de mauvaise qualité, loin de là. Mais, j'ai du mal a dire qu'il trône dans cette catégorie de prix... surtout que je viens d'acheter un Cairdeas Fino pour 105$ et que je le compare à un Corryvreckan que j'ai payé près de 115$. Bref, il y a de la compétition! En dehors, de son rapport/qualité prix plus ou moins bon, ce scotch est une merveille aromatique tout simplement! Énorme complexité que l'on reconnait comme une constance de la distillerie. 92% moins 5 point pour le prix = 87%"

null,"On the nose there is baked cinnamon apples ,caramel, hard candy with faint iodine and bandaid scents. On the palate this is oily, baked fruit, peaty, and smoked poultry. It finishes with a briny campfire, iodine, and a sharp warmth."
4.0,"Ardbeg day is upon us. Kids dropped off at swimming and I'm here at my local retailer celebrating. Now I've already tasted the committee which was a great dram. This...this is good but not the same level of deep rich char, tastes like what it is a watered down version. The char still seems to over power anything else going on...which is weird as I thought the reduced abv would help. Elements of the lemony flavour largely absent in the committee come through.  Definitely not in my top Ardbegs. Kelpie, Dark Cove, Cory and Uggie I'd have put ahead of this once price is factored in from memory. Although interestingly I also drank the Kelpie and Uggie with this one after I typed that up and although the Uggie kept its place the Kelpie wasn't as good as I remembered but it was the third dram. Solid 4 I'll give it down from the 4.25 for the committe which amazingly is the same price so I might get a bottle of that as if I don't drink I def won't lose $$."

5.0,"Another live dispatch from Feis Ile.  Unfortunately I’m missing Ardbeg’s open day at the end of the week because we’re leaving midway through the festival to continue our Highlands road trip.  Thankfully, Ardbeg offers free samples and sells bottles of their festival release, Grooves, before the big day!  I was ecstatic to get my hands on this and it did not disappoint.  This has been the bottle of Feis Ile for me so far.  

The nose explodes with scents of sweet, crisp apple and earth.  This is a complex dram with flavor far outpacing its moderate 46% ABV.   The palate has a divine, creamy mouthfeel and a rich, savory combination of caramel (the dominant note) and spicy smoked salami.  This whisky finishes with smoky, earthy, cappuccino peat.  This is one of the best 3-5 scotches I’ve had in my life."

4.0,"Smell: strong, fruity and berries. 
Taste: super smooth, smoky, some fruits and berries. 
Feel: really attacking if too much is taken. Take when you have a long time to taste it."
4.5,Best ardbeg for my taste. It's more than smoke and sweet herbs than usually. The wine really comes through and improves the impression substantially! (92/100)
4.75,"Got this as a gift, so I can't speak to price (it's around $100 from what I've seen), in either case this is some great whisky. I love pear and smoke in large quantities and boy does this deliver! Tar, ash, smoke, brine, sea salt, peat, it hits each nose (especially with a few drops of water). As far as value, I think I still like Ardbeg's uigeadail more and it's the same price, but it's definitely worth a try if you love ardbeg and don't mind the price tag."

3.0,Good whisky. The sweetness drove it away from its roots though. Might be a good intro to Islay whisky.
3.5,"It is always sad and joyful to drink an ardbeg. With so many of their bottlings being one offs, you never want to finish a bottle but it's a lot of fun to drink from one. This was sadly one I never saw the CR of and by the time the standard bottles made it to me, I assumed if Kelpie was still on shelves and Dark Cove was on shelves for over a year...surely Grooves would last. Sadly, I was wrong and this one was gone from shelves by me in record times. 

Nose -my first response is that that reminds me a bit more of Lagavulin's profile than Ardbeg. Those wine casks must be giving me a similar note to a PX sherry perhaps. Behind it is smooth smoke, sweet puffs, and a wonderful toasted oak. 

Taste - One of the things I love about Ardbeg in general is how broad the range of tasting sensations is and grooves takes that up a notch. I get sweet delicate wine notes up front with some sweet honey. Then it gets into these candied notes on the mid pallet almost like a lemon drop without the sour elements and not really a lemon flavor but the sweetness of that candy/sugar itself. Then we get into the peat and smoke as the finish brings with it spices and pepper and brine and smoke. With a lot of whiskies lately I bring up a distinct salt note, but not here. There is brine and with it salty elements but I don't get a distinct salt flavor. 

If you can still find grooves close to MSRP, get a bottle man! I'm putting this up there with some HEAVY hitters and I don't feel bad scoring it 3.5. It's no dark cove which spoiled us as that might have been a 4.5 at CS. Still get is a winner!"
4.75,"Nose; vanilla and smoke lead in equal parts. Oaky too. Salty brine. A touch of old leather. But then some sweetness bleeds through. Almost floral, with dark fruits. 

Taste; wow that is a flavour sensation. It's surprisingly smooth for how much fire and flavour this has. The peat and char lead here. Finish is long and dry. Salt, oily, smokey, this is terrific stuff. Think seaside bonfire with charred fruits.

4.25,"Ardbeg day testing!

Ardbeg 10, An Oa and Grooves

Let’s start here – All delicious and all worth buying.  

The An Oa has hints of new oak, and even French oak, with a nice spicy finish.  The finish is longer than the 10 and spicier.  The palette on the An Oa rolls a bit more and is little less brash and is more balanced.  The PX sherry takes the smoke and makes a pleasant whisky.  An Oa takes the win over the 10. 

The Grooves is sweeter, almost a bit of sticky wine finish.  The finish is longer than the An Oa and a bit better.  Sweet, balanced, lovely finish, a slight advantage over the An Oa. The win versus An Oa depends on your palette. If you like red wine the Grooves wins.  If you like bourbon the An Oa wins (I get some virgin oak impacts on the An Oa). 

Rankings 1. Grooves – due to the longer finish and a bit sweeter than the An Oa, 2 An Oa – better balance than the 10 and much better finish and 3. 10 – solid dram with aggressive smoke that is so easy to like.  All so good.  

I’d I was buying, I would pick An Oa.  If if was a gift I would pick Grooves."

3.25,"Nose is sweet, notes of grapes. Lots of spice with an abundance of smoke and peat. Decently long finish."
4.5,"Ahh, Ardbeg.  I've fully explored Arbeg's core offerings, but never had any of the annual limited edition bottles.  I began to remedy that deficiency during my recent visit to the Flatiron Room in NYC by selecting the Grooves.

Quite simply, this is a gem.  Full of flavor, both sweet and smoke, with a fairly gentle but lengthy finish.  There's a lot to like here, but the two highlights are the red wine finish notes, which are strongest on the beginning of the palate and throughout the finish, and the peat smoke, which makes a grand entrance mid-palate.  The wine notes are natural straightforward fruit sweetness.  As for the peat, Ardbeg's is simply my favorite.  Bold, barbeque and meaty, without ashiness or any trace of smoky bitterness.  That peat note is on full display in the Groove.  

Perhaps the most pleasant surprise came when I located a bottle for sale at a reasonable price.  I expected they would be entirely gone.  I look forward to exploring the Grooves in more depth!"

4.25,"The smoke is overpowering, but in the best way possible. Incredible"
4.5,"Initially a wet smoke hits you. Then BBQ flavour and finally the Ardbeg herbal notes and sweetness come through. On the palate it's all out BBQ paired with sweetness and some honey. With water it gets sweeter and tends to switch to wet smoke again. The finish is long lasting, bold and rather smokey. 
Man this is terrific. The red wine really seems to go well with the ardbeg house style. This is by far the most complex and best Ardbeg I had. (90/100)"
