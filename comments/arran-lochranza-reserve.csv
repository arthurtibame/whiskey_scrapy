3.5,The traits of the core Arran Malts of bright grape and cereal sugar however more elusive and harsh. A more complex finish than it has a right to be that adds smoke and peanut husk reminiscent of dusty bourbons.

2.75,Oily.  Now overly sweet.  No burn.
4.5,"This is a wonderful whisky, unique peaty-smokey character with sweet, fruity apples maybe pear?  Taste is deep earthy yet light fruity zesty slight spicy elements that keeps you going back for more.  Well done, I think I'm going to be a White Stag after this dram."

3.5,Light. Approachable. Yum.
3.0,"Arran tasting night at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 12 July 2019. Whisky #1

Nose:  Light fragrant cereal with a biscuit quality and vanilla notes (reminiscent of vanilla macaroons or langue de chat). Mild citrus, apple and a tiny hint of maritime brine.

Palate: A sparkling, sweet cereal arrival and a dry malty development, but the overall impression is of a lean, bright sweetness. The dry notes resolve to elegant spicy tones. The texture is fine, but not particularly noteworthy.

Finish: Medium/short. Cereal notes fading into a slightly briny/spiced aftertaste.

The whisky has a clean and crisply dry foundation with sweet top-notes. It comprises 7-8 year old spirit that is mostly matured in refill bourbon casks.

It's a light and refreshing malt, good for summer and probably very nice in a long Japanese-style highball. The only thing particularly going against it is the price point, at which it is completely outmatched by several iconic single malts of great character. I last reviewed this a couple of years ago - there have been no changes at all in the profile, and my rating is the same.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
3.25,"Au nez : sec et amer, fruits à coques, amandes, épices, chocolat au lait, terreux et légèrement floral, également une touche  type cognac
Au palais : salé et légèrement amer, fruits à coque, boisé, note médicinale
La finale est moyenne, amer, métallique et manque de saveur

Note personnelle : 82/100

Entrée de gamme NAS sympathique mais un manque de complexité notamment au palais. Cela étant dit, ce whisky est un très bon rapport qualité-prix"

3.0,"Sweet, citrusy and light. This was my first bottle, recommended to me by a trusted friend as an introduction to the world of Scotch. I like to revisit it every now and then to see if my opinion has changed.

As my first dram it was rough, whereas now I have gravitated towards the peated stuff, so this is smooth and easy drinking. 

A perfect bottle to introduce someone to Scotch, and a pleasant way to ""tune"" my palate before I move onto the more complex stuff during a drinking session."

4.0,"Pears in honey on the nose, taste was salted caramel, butter creme, Werther's candy, whisp of smoke and ginger spice (not the pop singer). Refreshing as sea breeze. May be a new favorite."

3.0,"Nose: Fresh citrus nose with a hint of general spiciness and brine. A delicate honeysuckle sweetness and a background of oak.

Palate: A light arrival with a sweet, zesty character.  The development brings light fruit, spices, and a little hint of oak. When first opened there was an almost sherbet-like quality from bright ginger spice notes.

Finish: Short, trailing off into dry spiciness.

For an obviously young no-age statement whisky this is perfectly OK, but it does lack the authority of the more mature Arran expressions. Refreshing and light on a hot day, particularly with a splash of soda, it’s the equivalent of a light verdelho. Very approachable but not a classic by any means. It competes competently against similarly priced single malts and good blends.

“Above Average” : 3 stars"
