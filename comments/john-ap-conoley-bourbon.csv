3.5,"Dark Amber in color, color added I’m sure.  Nose is strong with spices (cloves), vanilla and caramel.  No real complexity to it but that wouldn’t be expected in a 2 yr old bourbon.  I don’t think it would mix well but it’s not too bad sipping over a piece of ice.  It’s local for me so I’ll give it an extra point for that.  I met the folks that build it and I feel their heart is in the right place and I expect (hope) to see their efforts improve over time."

2.0,the nc distillery caught my eye in the store so i decided to give it a go esp for the price. 25 for a fifth. Great day it has an aftertaste that goes between cinnamon to licorice to mulberry. I drank the first pour over ice. Then i used it in a whiskey sour both times it did not suit me.  That aftertaste to me is awful but for 25 bucks there are better values which taste like bourbon not flavored bourbon. Maybe the age statement had something to do with it but....For the price just get some EW BIB
4.5,Very different flavor profile from other whiskeys
