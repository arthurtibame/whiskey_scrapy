3.0,"Got this one for about 26 bucks, so I got a nice deal, but I am not expecting a superb experience. The nose brings pleasant subtle peat smoke, vanilla, salty brine, woody notes, and floral properties. The mouth coat is thin, and the 40% ABV is a bit of a downer. The palate is good though, especially for the price. Milk chocolate, maritime brine, vanilla, honey, a touch of wood and peat smoke on the palate as well. Doesn't blow your socks off, but definitely a really nice economical daily sipper. It's a 3.0, and the theme is going to be ""Sailing"" by Christopher Cross. Not normally available in the USA, but worth a look."

2.0,"Bowmore tasting evening at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, June 26th 2019: Whisky #1

Nose: The first aromas are mild lemon and brine, then light vanilla and cereal notes emerge together with a fragile smoky presence. If you were being generous you could describe it as a delicate nose, but I thought it simply lacked presence. There is an unfortunate aroma of cardboard or plywood in the background.

Palate: The palate is a reprise of the nose, having an arrival that is mildly salty and citric with a smidge of peat followed by a development of dry cereal flavours. The same sawdusty / reconstructed wood-pulp character shows up again and then more brine emerges and the dryness veers towards sour tannic notes. Adding water provides some balance by developing sweetness but it also conjures a soapy taste, and the palate is very easy to drown. The texture is rather flat.

Finish: Very short. One moment the development is gently fading and the next there is nothing.

The profile is classic Bowmore but this expression seems muted and lacking in verve, as though it has been over-diluted. It’s a simple, even generic, malt and while there are not any particularly off notes neither are there any particularly impressive ones.

It does have a clean, fresh presentation but to be honest at this price you can do better.

“Acceptable” : 2 stars"

2.5,"I'm judging this based on price. I paid £20 against an rrp of around £32.

The 12 year old, especially on offer, is a decent everyday drop. The whisky is comforting and pleasant with that touch of smoke to keep the toper interested. I like it. Number 1 is the same but so much less.

The nose is benign. There is a bit of smoke and a nibble of vanilla. The taste is (top note) peat (mid note) vanilla and generic sweet. There is little from then on. The aftertaste revisits smoke and there's a nudge of youthful alcohol burn (it is NAS). Then... Well, it just ends.

A timid drink designed to be inoffensive and as such is a success. Most punters will enjoy it. Number 1 is a decent first foray into Islay. I would be disappointed had I paid the higher price."

2.0,First scent is kinda meh.. But gets better. Overall light bodied but has a sting to the last  part. Oh so slightly tastes of peat and lime/tropical fruits.
2.0,Falls flat on flavour. A bit oily and sweet. Peaty and tart. Smooth

3.0,"Surprisingly good, but a little ‘burny’ aftertaste like cheaper bottles. Not a favourite but a good buy if on sale."
3.0,"A favourite of mine, as the price allows the shelf to be kept well stocked and my guests' cup's full!"
3.5,An enjoyable journey from vanilla notes passing through oak senses and finishing with a smooth peated touched.
