4.0,"This is an absolute personal favorite of mine. The fact that it is distilled in the great Buckeye State makes it even more amazing. The whiskey is definitely a neat only for me, I think ice or water close of the flavor and shut it down. Straight up notes of wheat and sweet vanilla make this whiskey an easy drinker. Caramel and baking spices remind me of homemade cookies, which makes everything even better!"
3.0,"[9/26/14] So smooth. This is a craft bourbon made here in Columbus. Sweet wheat, with a bit of spice and salty, caramel apple - this is stereotypical fall in Ohio. Unfortunately it's just a bit too soft and mellow to give more than 3 stars. Absolutely love the place and the guys doing this work are going to turn out many great products."

4.0,"Bold vanilla aroma with a touch of oak along with lingering sweet notes.  In first sip, rye spice upfront shifting quickly to vanilla pudding and definite brown sugar. Some spice lingers with a subtle grain-like presence that fades quickly."

3.0,"It smells (yellow cake batter, burnt sugar) better than it tastes ( underdeveloped and musty dry oak) I agree with Jon...more time. For as young as watershed is I think they did a decent job. but i put more faith in some of their other spirits (the gins). If you want to support local craft it is not a bad offering. Batch #62"
3.0,"3.5. Kidney colored urine, rye, all spice, cinnamon, spicy oak, harsh finish, nice burn."

1.0,"Nose: Clean baby diaper (this scent was so distracting I couldnt pick up anything else, now that I think about it this could have been left over from the detergent the bar used)
Taste: Nothing exciting, leather and a little sweet. Not many nice strong flavors present
Finish: short and a bit sweet.

Because the off smell could be from residual detergent I'm unsure if this whiskey is really deserving of this score but I doubt it's worth another try. Every other bourbon we had (7 in total) didnt have any similar smells so I am thinking it was just the whiskey itself."

2.5,"Alcohol and slight green apple nose. More and different flavors than expected, but still young and thin. Not offensive but not impressive either."
4.0,"Nice smooth, little pepper, little honey"
1.0,Terrible aroma - straight ethanol burn. Thin and watery. Super hot with no subtlety. Very little of the classic bourbon flavors I look for. This’ll be the new one for mixers.

2.25,Reminds me of bird dog ... ehh
3.25,"Nose is lemony, spicy, some mint. Very cool.
Taste has a bit of erasers and young, but opens up to caramel candy, some baking spice, butterscotch and lemon peels.
Finish is quick, no heat. Some vanilla pudding and mustiness lingers but the finish is the least impressive of the steps.
All and all good whiskey. Would like to try higher proof or more age."
