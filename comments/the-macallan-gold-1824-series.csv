2.0,It's a simple fruity scotch. Noticeable alcohol presence. Not impressed with the smoothness considering its Macallan. Better off with a Jura 10 Year.
5.0,A solid whisky for the price.

3.0,"Average-to-good scotch for an an average scotch price. Certainly below the bar Macallan has set for itself, but they'll probably make up for it in volume."
4.0,Very fruity. Not worth the price I think. Glenfiddich 15 better value for money.

4.0,"A very pleasant and balance whisky for the price point, and interestingly better than its more expensive brother the Amber. I would assume it was aged in ex-bourbon casks because both the nose and palate display the typical notes: vanilla and honey. There's a certain added element of tropical fruit which gives it a pleasant sweetness, and the final product is quite enjoyable. Enjoy!"

2.5,"Nose: Citrus, lemon zest, grapefruit juice, cereals - this is a very bright nose. A little hint of malt and oak and some vanilla, but the citrus washes over everything. Reminiscent of lemon scented furniture spray-polish (curiously, the dry-glass aroma is full of honey with not a trace of citrus).

Palate: A soft but tannic arrival that develops into a palate dominated by bitter/sweet citrus flavours. Strikingly like the taste of neat lemon essence cooking flavouring. There is a mix of inherent sweetness and bitter oak tannin and it's hard to decide whether it gives balance or is just an odd combination. There are some subtle cereal flavours in the background that are emphasized slightly by water.

Finish: Medium, more citrus (sigh - I'm over all this bitter lemon character now), also yeast - quite bread-like and drying. It seems short at first but lingers.

I found this more interesting than enjoyable as it's not a style of whisky I particularly like. A teaspoon of water improves the nose, giving it breadth and making it less strident - quite pleasant and almost fruity-floral, in fact. Unfortunately it does not improve the taste as much. Some extra notes are revealed, but mostly it just dilutes it and eventually makes it fall apart.  If it was bottled at a higher abv and could take the water more gracefully the palate might fare much better with dilution, allowing some desperately needed sweetness to emerge from the cereal component.

I tasted it from a 30ml sampler and have no desire to purchase a bottle, particularly considering the price.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"

Burnished Gold

NOSE

Lemon citrus, then orange peel and an interlacing sweetness that softens but doesn't eliminate the zest. A quiet note of vanilla is followed by dark chocolate with lingering floral and light oak notes.

PALATE

Citrus and boiled sweets rule the palate, along with hints of ginger and cinnamon, while soft oak tones reveal toasted apples.

FINISH

Medium sweet, malty and slightly dry."

4.25,"This is my favourite Macallan from the 1824 series. It's simple, elegant, and it's the best ""bang for your buck"". From the first sniff, you can really grasp the aroma of an orange peel, which then mixes well with the taste of a sweet, vanilla/cinnamon/almost like a toasted apple taste. The finish is very smooth and just the right amount of ""sweet"".  
If you're just getting into nice whisky's, or you want a go-to whisky for after a long day at the office, this is your bottle."

4.0,"[Troon, Scotland. 8/16/18] Off to play Championship Course at Royal Troon on Friday. Starting golf trip off on world class course; might as well couple this with world class distillery. The Macallan 1824 series is a grouping of NAS expressions predicated on color and not age. This whisky‘s name is a good indication of such, and it consists of sherry aged product having slept in a combination of American and European oak for 9 to 15 years. The nose is elegant with a constrained measure of sherry. The palate is also balanced with proper levels of both fruitiness and sweetness. A medium finish is smooth and satisfying. Macallan fans will not be disappointed in this offering, but neither will they be inspired. I would rate this at a high 3 to 4 with our current venue giving them the extra nudge. :)"

On the nose you get vanilla, toffee, oranges, almonds and medicinal woods. 

On the palate you will find a simple, straightforward almond and oak taste, with a short finish, which overall taste is hot but not too hot, spicy but not too spicy. 

I believe this is a Whisky to have with friends in a not so special night, and by far is the most mediocre Macallans i have tasted so far. Having said that, there are worst whiskies, this is not bad, it is just... regular"
