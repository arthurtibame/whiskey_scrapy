3.0,Nothing is strong about this. Pretty boring but there is nothing bad about it. Will keep set aside for non whiskey drinking guests who wanna mix it with coke.

2.25,"Nose is heavenly, lots of banana, and juicy fruit gum.. could smell it all day.
Palate is initially sickly sweet with those same flavours but then flattens out mid palate with some corn, oak and heat. 
Finishes quick and dry.
The nose is better then the palate, and the palate is better then the finish.
For the money a decent whiskey."
5.0,"Sweet and delicately smokey, with a caramel finish. 1.5 measures topped up with Diet Coke and ice."

3.75,"I grew up on Jack Black and it is fabulous with a Coke. As a stand-alone on rocks, it is sweet and a bit harsh. After a while, the drink mellows out and I can taste the smokey maple flavors in the whiskey. Nice!"

4.0,"Banana, corn, caramel and vanilla notes. On the palate more of the same with strong banana and caramel corn. Smooth with a long finish. A fantastic bourbon for either sipping or cocktails."

2.5,"First time tasting neat after trying some other more premium whiskies. Definitely banana on the nose plus some caramel and corn. Getting an unpleasant  astringency and bitterness in the taste in the development. Some alcohol burn as well, especially at this proof. Thin viscosity. I was surprised by a fairly long finish of straightforward oak notes, but nothing interesting enough to make me want to drink it again."
2.5,Where is the Diet Coke?

2.0,"Overpowering medicinal banana on both the nose and palate, more burn than you would expect for something bottled at 40%. 

I can somewhat understand why people enjoy this, having such a sweet and syrupy profile, but it's not for me. 

It's also fairly expensive here in Canada compared to other much more enjoyable & reasonably priced staple bottles such as Jim Beam White & Evan Williams Black. I would go as far as to say the price point is borderline offensive (I paid close to $25 with tax for a 375ml bottle) especially when you consider what 750ml bottles are available for under $40."

3.0,オールドターキーとかジムビームに比べて、バーボンっぽい甘ったるさが全然ない。それだけに無個性とも言えるが、こちらの方がアメリカンの中では好き。

3.5,"I think I have drank 100 Jack and Cokes, but I don't think that I have ever smelled it neat. 

Enjoyed this neat. 

On the nose- bananas, vanilla

Taste- bananas, sugar and oak"

2.25,Vanilla cream with the slightest touch of pepper.  Caramel popcorn.  More syrupy than oily. Bready notes in the finish. OK Nilla wafers actually.  Not a great deal of depth is the issue for me.

3.0,"Appearance:  Amber tending a bit more orange
Nose:  Frosted Flakes.  Blend of sweet and corn.  Bit of vanilla.
First Impressions.  Char, bit of a burn for low proof, vanilla even more muted but still sweet.  Oak.
Finish: Oak coming on stronger with a lingering smoke.  Lasts a fair bit.

Overall, a nice middle road.  Can stand on its own but won’t get lost in cocktails."

3.0,"Jack Daniel’s has always been my go-to. Perfect to mix on a night out.

On occasion I enjoy this whisky neat. I like to sweetness of this whisky and the hints of the smokey flavour."

3.5,"Nose: smells like a bourbon. With a note a banana.
Taste: really spicy, warm in the mouth, round, and oily, butterscotch and a little bitter.
Much better than the single barrel. A really great budget whiskey."
