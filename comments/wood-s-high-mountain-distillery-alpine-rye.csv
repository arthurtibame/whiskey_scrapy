4.0,"Really good, tasty rye. Strong earth tones but not too oaky. Rich, and complex."
4.0,"Appearance: Clear, bright amber. Incredibly slow legs

Nose: simple, pepper, rye, malted grains, subtle notes of caramel

Palate: Initially sweet quickly followed by peppery spice. The other grains provide a biscuity note. Adding some water pulls out the vanilla and caramel imparted by the barrel along with a light chili pepper note. 

Finish: pretty straightforward light spiciness. Mild intensity, but long lasting."
