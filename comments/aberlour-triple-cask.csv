3.25,"Here’s a new-ish release from Speyside distillery, Aberlour.  It’s an NAS bottling that contains whisky from three different types of maturation:  American oak, European oak and sherry casks.  So, what name did Aberlour settle on for this release?  Triple Cask.  Very clever, very very clever.  This was initially intended to be a European release, but I believe it is now being offered worldwide.  It’s bottled at 40% ABV and has added color and chill-filtration.  I added this bottle to an international order about a month ago for $32 (70cl).

It’s new penny copper in the glass with watery, fat legs and heavy drops and noses like any typical Speysider:  sherry fruits, vanilla, green apple slices, caramel swirls and a faint, fresh oak.  There’s no indication of heat and giving extra time or drops of water doesn’t open up a thing.  Just pour it and get after it.

The palate is practically a carbon copy of the nose, with a little more oak barrel presence.  It’s slightly harsh at mid sip and turns even more bitter towards the back end.  The sherry casks take over the mouth coat at the very end, much like they do on the standard 12, 16 and 18 year old bottles.  The finish is medium length and bitter.  Warm oak leads to a lingering, but faint sweetness.

In the end, this is just another typical Aberlour.  There’s nothing offensive about it, but the complexity either doesn’t exist or is masked by bitter oak and low ABV.  Stick with the Casg Annamh or the A’Bunadh if you’re a fanboy of this distillery or just want more flavor and impact from your Aberlour.  At $32, it’s a great deal if you see it sitting on shelves, but I’d rather spend another $20-30 for a whisky with more depth and/or power.  3 stars with a .25 star bump for the price point.  Cheers."
