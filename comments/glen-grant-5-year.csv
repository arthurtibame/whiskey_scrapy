3.0,"The nose reveals all its youth, with a lot of malt and cereal that are accompanied by green apple, honey and a hint of almond, with a marked herbaceous profile. Light lemon note. Simple, fresh, straightforward.
On the palate, the malt triumphs by rolling happily in a sheaf of cut grass, putting the green apple on the corner to prefer the almonds that are more present here, with a distant touch of vanilla and nutmeg. Alcohol is introduced with far too much audacity for its 40%ABV, brushing a profile that would otherwise be too peaceful but still superficial. In the long run, the aromas flatten on a mixture of malt and alcohol, very, very immature.
The finish is short, ethereal, dry, of cereals, dried fruit. green apple and alcohol.
For such a paltry price it would be absurd to expect stratification and complexity, it is a basic whisky, which offers what the absent-minded drinker expects: simple, delicate flavors and alcoholic bang.
Homework passed."
