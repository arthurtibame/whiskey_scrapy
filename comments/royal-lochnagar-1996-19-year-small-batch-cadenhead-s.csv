4.0,"Big, round and hot. Long finish"
4.75,A light color and delicate fruity nose offers a punch of rich flavor with a nice hot finish.  I’m a fan!
5.0,"The Cadenheads scattered around Whisky Live NY on Wednesday were some of the highlights of the show for me and this bottle was probably the pick of the bunch. Royal Lochnagar is apparently the main component of Johnnie Walker Blue, so if you're familiar with that you'll have a sense of how smooth and luxurious this tasted. The high proof was just on the edge of my comfort zone but it went down easy -- deliciously rich, honeyed and thick. A memorable experience."
5.0,Rating is actually of the 17 year ahead single malt.
