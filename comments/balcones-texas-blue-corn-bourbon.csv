4.0,"You can definitely taste the corn in this one, I really enjoyed it. Fairly smooth and easy to drink neat, especially chilled a little. I am not wild about the premium price on this one, but for special occasions I would pick up another bottle. I like that it is actually distilled in Texas, so that is a plus in my book."

4.0,"What a lovely dram! On a recent visit to the Balcones distillery in Waco, TX I tried this with a few other drams (see other recent reviews), and found this to live up to its reputation here in Texas. On the nose, it's a more full bodied version of their Baby Blue, with almost a smooth tea note and some leather (think leather bound books). The taste is super smooth, with sweet corn notes, black tea, and lots of oak from all that time in the barrel in the Texas heat. The finish is moderate but with minimal burn. A bit pricy due to the Angel's Share here in Texas, but a quality drop if you find it near you."

4.5,"This is far and away the best Texas bourbon on the market. 

Nose: Rich molasses, corn, toasted sugar. 

Taste: Molasses, toasted marshmallow, corn, caramel. The oak is there throughout but not overpowering. 

Mouth feel: Rich and velvety. High oil content that makes this a luxurious experience. 

Finish: As big and bold as Texas itself. Great smoothness with lingering heat. 

Definitely the best bourbon in Texas, and a bourbon whose uniqueness gives it a spot in the upper echelons of bourbon today."

5.0,"This is my first Distiller review. Had to leave some love for this dram because it’s one of the most unique and well-balanced bourbons I’ve had. And I think it’s been poorly represented. 

Bought my bottle the first week of October 2018

Color: dark almost maple syrup Amber. One of the darkest I’ve seen. 

Nose: Caribbean rum cake, sweet prunes, overripe fruit, allspice. One of the most unique bourbon noses to date for me. 

Palate: ripe dark fruit, oak, chai spice, oily,  prune, tobacco, and vanilla. Extremely well balanced. Doesn’t punch you in the face with the proof. 

Finish: Long, complex, definitely more of the licorice and tobacco and oak spice. But all sweet with a molasses undertone. 

Overall... this is top shelf for me. If you love cask strength... buy it. If you love unique flavors and aren’t afraid of something a little different... get it. One of the most well balanced bourbons I’ve had. I will be picking up a 2nd bottle so I can thoroughly enjoy this dram at my leisure. Much love to Balcones for creating a unique and quality offering in the bourbon market. Hopefully it gets more recognition and wins some more awards because it’s worthy. Til then I’ll stock up ;)"

1.0,I had it 5 years ago and again yesterday. Not for me and not really a bourbon in my book. Too much of a white corn alcohol flavor to me. There is some sweetness there but that white dog taste is all I focus on.

4.75,High ABV hides much of the character of this corn bourbon. A few drops of water brings out more flavors and it becomes one of my favorite Texas whiskeys. Definitely try it with some water.

4.0,"This is a brash, complex, brawling, rawbone bourbon that just screams Texas right in your face. The label is perfect too. It’s got an ear of blue corn on it that’s so pretty you think maybe this is a gentle and delicate little whiskey.

It ain’t.

130 proof. I drank mine, slapped the bar, and let out a couple of yips. 

Brother or sister, you want to taste this whiskey. It’s got everything you want in a bourbon. All the sweet notes, toffee and caramel and vanilla. Honestly, I can’t tell the difference between those, but they are there. Like candy. Rich too. Deep. Dark red. This is just a beautiful Texas Bourbon.

And get ready to start saying “Texas Bourbon” more often. Take notice, Kentucky. We’re making your whiskey down here now and we’re doing it right."

4.0,"Not for the meek, it’s sweetness is well offset by heat and just a bit of spice.  I sip this neat. Good enough that I went back and bought two more bottles to put in the bunker.  Supposedly has around thirty months on it; I’d love to see how this would do with a couple more years in the barrell."
