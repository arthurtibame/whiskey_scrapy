4.0,Looks and smells like a young whiskey but tastes much more mature. Very smooth tastes come and go slowly. A very impressive bourbon out of DC!!  I’m drinking batch 3 and I’m a fan. I look forward to trying more as their stocks age.
4.25,"Batch No.3: Has a floral and almost sherry-like on nose. Smooth tastes of dark cherry, butterscotch, rich taste with a medium finish. Gifted to me (thanks Mike F!) but will buy next time I see it. Hopefully future batches are as consistent! Well done."
3.0,"Pretty good, but does not stand out and somewhat overpriced."

3.75,"I love the folks at this distillery and I think this bourbon is super smart and fun.

It's a straight bourbon so it obviously sits the two required years in a new barrel but then they rest it in used rum casks and that's really what stands out in this bourbon.

Smoothe rum caramel with the corn after taste."
4.0,The one I had was finished in spiced rum barrels so I'm not sure if I'm reviewing the same one. Sweetness and warmth followed by molasses.
