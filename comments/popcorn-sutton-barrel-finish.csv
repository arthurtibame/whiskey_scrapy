3.0,"Aroma is sweet, with mild vanilla, oak, and coffee notes. Alcohol smell leaves reasonably quickly. Initial taste is sweet, with hints of cherry, followed by a wood bitterness that lingers, but is not unpleasant. This is smoother than I would have expected for a three-year aged brown liquor.
                
This is decent...much better than I would have expected from a shine source. It was a gift from the wife, so I don't know how much it cost. I probably would have passed on it given its origin. I'm glad she bought it because this is pretty good. I also have an open bottle of Angel's Envy, but I find myself going to this more often.
                
I can't wait until they start producing a Tennessee whiskey. I expect good things from that distillery."
