3.0,"I’ve tried Longrow, I’ve really tried. But I’m afraid this relationship isn’t working. We should be very compatible. I like Springbank. I like peat. And yet, there’s something about the way you combine the two that colors me ambivalent. Maybe it’s because I like my smoke meaty, and you’re often on the sweet side. Or maybe it’s that yeasty mid-palette flavor that leaves me cold. Don’t get me wrong, you’re good for a one-night stand: that yeast is redeemed with a dash of cream and your soy sauce and mint chocolate notes are welcome in my mouth. But I don’t see us moving in together, no matter your age. Anyway, I’m in love with the girl next door — Kilkerran.  Sorry."
