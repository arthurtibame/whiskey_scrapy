3.75,"This is the Galway Bay brewery, stout beer barrel finish version of Teeling Small Batch. For me this finishing brings some chocolatey or coffee taste into the product. Overwrites the harsh spiceyness of the original product, but complexity remains. For me better than the original blended Teeling or the Jameson Caskmates Stout."

2.0,"Nose: floral honey sweetness

Palate: smooth oily texture. Light caramel notes.

Finish: at the very end, some faint tannin barrel bitterness.

Can't say I can pick out the stout barrel's contribution anywhere. Which is a shame."
