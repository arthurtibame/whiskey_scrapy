4.5,"Now this is something. It’s hot, but it’s so rich in flavor and complexity, it bursts straight through the ABV. Cherry, wood, cinnamon, leather, corn. Thick mouthfeel, rich flavor. Fantastic. One of the best high proof bourbons I’ve had."

4.5,"Sweet, oily and full of flavor.  Oak, vanilla, cola and fruit dominate the profile. Exceptional."
5.0,The best smooth sipping whiskey I have ever tasted. Very pricey but I will be get another bottle on my next trip through the Texas hill country.
