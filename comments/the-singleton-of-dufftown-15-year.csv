3.0,Sweet and nothing special.  There are better options.
4.25,"Toffee, burnt caramel, hint of chalk. Tastes better at the last sip when fully aerated"
4.0,"Marzipan and ripe fruit welcome the smell, unfolding in a soft and warm mix of pineapple, peach, red fruits, malt biscuits, cinnamon. Slight woody and herbaceous scent in the background. Not very penetrating but pleasant.
The biscuit and caressing malt is proposed on the palate, always accompanied by fruit and spices, custard, ripe pear, hazelnuts. Astringency of the wood in the background.
Rather short finish, with hazelnuts, malt and wood.
I admit I was biased, expecting an ethereal and colorless whisky, while instead I found myself in front of an honest, simple product, perhaps a little overpriced compared to its merits, but not despicable."

2.75,Sweet fruit and chalk on the nose. Nice body with toffee. Finish a bit harsh for a 15. Not bad but wouldn't but again.

3.75,"Apple and dried fruits on the nose, caramel, faint bit of smoke covered by the fruits.  Taste is a shocker - spicy notes up front, settling into apple and fruits with hints of vanilla shortbread cookies.  Quick finish with fresh green apple lingering on the tongue"
