3.0,For me this was definitely a “gentle dram”. Easy drinking despite the relatively higher ABV. Great intro whiskey for beginners!

3.0,Whisky Lite. This belongs in a tasting group as the extreme end of the easy drinking spectrum. Quite good for what it is. A good intro for whisky virgins.

3.25,Spicy. Intense.
4.0,"On the nose is sweet apples, vanilla, floral honey, lemon zest, strawberries and a slight cinnamon spice with hints of cedar wood.
-
To the palate it is a little sharp at first, with green apple citrus, honey, vanilla, black pepper, spicy oak, cinnamon, bitter lemon peel and a marmalade sweetness.
-
The finish is quite full, with lingering floral herbal notes, spices, rich toffee sweetness and a touch of oak.
—
This is a not so “gentle dram”, but it is satisfyingly flavourful, despite its slightly youthful character at 14 years.

2.0,Very light. Not impressed for a 14 year old whisky. Nose almost nothing but a whisper of fruit. Pallet crisp fruit. Finish spice that lingers in mouth. Not recommended if buying.
2.25,"The nose points to some peat, but there's none on the palate.  There is a muddled, chemical-like character befitting a Campbeltown.  The finish wraps things up into an ""average"" scotch profile.  

However, it is smooth for a 46% ABV.  This higher than average ABV also leaves a greater impression than the bottle merits.  

The palate opens up with subsequent sips, turning into something like a regular bourbon cask scotch - with the muddle hitting at the mid-palate.  This is somewhere between a Campbeltown and Highland flavor profile, with unimpressive results.

3.75,"You got at 46% non chill-filtered.

There is something beautiful about this natural light straw color. I like a dram that doesn't hide its age.

Strong alcohol presence on the nose, then butterscotch, fruit and vanilla.

Quite oily, surprisingly briny, sweet and very spicy. In that order. The strong cinnamon and pepper spice make way to lingering bitterness of cocoa and mint. 

This is super nice. I like it spicy and this one delivers."

3.25,A decent dram but not worth the price point in my honest opinion.  There are better 14 year old expressions out there.
3.0,"It's soft on the nose, defined by creamy pear with faint clove and baking spice notes. The taste is the same, though slightly acetone. Rather lacking in complexity and richness. Not great but oddly endearing."
3.75,"Pours a lovely light straw color, no carmel in this non chill-filtered dram.  Noses a sweet honeyed malt with some floral and fruit (apple?) overtones.  These come through on the initial tasting and are followed with a lively peppery note on the follow through, I think from the oak.  Experimenting, I have found the peppery aspect decreases with either allowing the dram to breath for a few minutes, or adding a few DROPS of water to the dram.  (A splash of water simply turns this dram in to a nondescript mess.)  We all have different preferences.  There is no smoke, peat, or sherry in this dram.  It is one of those gentle malt and slightly floral drams.  If you enjoy that style (and I do) this would be a good one for you to try.  (I personally would list Glen Grant 12, Glenmorangie 10, Ancnoc 12, and Compass Box Artist Blend in that group.)"
