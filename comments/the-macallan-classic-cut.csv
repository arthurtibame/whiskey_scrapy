3.0,"Rich flavors of sherry and toffee. Easier to drink than the ABV suggests, but the strength obscures any complexity. An aftertaste of burnt sugar. No doubt needs more exploration than my small sample provided, but I’ll probably pass on the opportunity given my apathy for cask strength bottlings."

4.0,"fermented honey and slight maltiness on the nose, closely resembling mead or flat warm beer. inital taste is nutty and sherried with the swallow bringing in bourbon oak vanillaness and an unmistakable ginger bite is left on the tongue. the 58.4% is not felt in the palate but defineatly felt in the stomach"

5.0,"Easily the best Macallan I’ve had. The best way to put this is like so: if you like Macallan 12 Sherry Oak, it’s that and much more. 

The nose is pure sweetness: Cherry, raisin, brown sugar.

The taste is very similar to the classic Mac12 but MORE. Its everything great about Macallan turned up to 11. 

This really opens up with a few drops of water. The flavors on the tongue become more complex and enjoyable. 

Truly an amazing release. This puts the “Edition” line to shame. I hope they turn this into a regular offering instead of a limited one."
4.0,"It’s time for the newest, limited release Macallan:  the Classic Cut.  This fall 2017 special offering is a NAS re-imagining of the Cask Strength bottling from the early 2000’s.  This bottle is even stronger, coming in at 58.4%.  The thing is- I don’t think this is truly cask strength.  It’s not a single cask and all bottles are the exact same ABV.  This is just younger spirit that was probably blended down from somewhere just north of 60%.  There is definitely color added because it’s a deep, rich mahogany in the glass.

So, what we essentially have here is a test batch for the possible replacement of the standard 12 year old?  If that is the case I kind of like it.  Here in Virginia this bottle is only $21 ($89+ tax) more than the 12.  I’d gladly pay that for the increased ABV.  There isn’t much else different between the Classic Cut and the age statement 12 year sherry cask.

The nose is red berries, raisins and sugary malt with the extra heat blocking much of the oak.  Which, let’s be honest, is probably a good thing when it comes to younger spirit.  I’m guessing this stuff is between 7-9 years old.  

The palate still has the dominating Macallan flavor profile along with a solid showing from some well selected sherry wine casks.  I was hoping for a harder hitting version of the Rare Cask, but that didn’t materialize.  It’s just a harder version of the 12 year.  The reason I say I expected Rare Cask is because the labeling on the bottle and box is kind of similar to what they advertise for Rare.  And who wouldn’t love a Rare Cask clone for 1/3 of the price?

The finish is long, long, long.  The drying aspect of the oak is the only flaw I can actively find.  Almost every Macallan I’ve tried (minus the Fine Oak series) leaves your mouth oily and watering.  This one cannot do that because of the strength.  I’ve come to expect that mouth watering feel from Macallan but it isn’t found here and that’s disappointing.  

Overall, I really enjoy this one.  There’s plenty of bang for the buck, plenty of the Macallan-esque flavor profile, and extra oomph to get you across the finish line when you’re looking to “tie one on”.  4.25 stars.  Cheers and Happy New Year, my friends."

4.0,"Thanks to my friend @LeeEvolved, I got to try this one.  To me, it comes across as the 10 ( or 12...I forget which is their lowest age statement) yr old, except much more pronounced in every aspect.  Makes me wonder if the 10 or 12 will go away, and they’d have  this instead?  Either way, in terms of an affordable, and very good, Macallan, I’d say this is right up there along with their Edition 2 and 3.  Thanks Lee for the sample !"

4.5,"version de 2017

nez: Sherry, bois et épice au nez.

bouche : intense! une forte intensité aromatique vous frappe en plein visage. cannelle et pommes rouges. gingembre et fraises. épicé et fruité. un gâteau aux fruits! des noix, du bois sec brûlé. une texture grasse, épaisse et goûteuse! Abunadh is that you?

final : longue, sur les fruits secs, épicée et boisée.

overall : un gros monstre de Sherry. vous vous connaissez, si c'est votre genre vous allez adorer. si ce ne l'est pas ... passez. je crois que je préfère tout de même le abunadh pour le simple fait qu'il est moins épicé mais c'est tout de même une de mes bouteilles de Sherry bomb de prédilection. si seulement la gamme standard de Macallan était aussi bonne. le prix est un peu élevé considérant un A'bunadh a 35$ de moins ici en SAQ. bref, un must pour les Sherry-bomb lovers mais ne réussit pas a détrôner l'icône du Sherry-bomb par excellence. un gros 94%"

4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Spicy vanilla, orange zest, fresh ginger, toasted oak sugars, creme brulee, hint of sultanas (w/ water) Warm oaky vanilla, fresh ginger & orange zest, light dried stone fruits.

Taste - (w/o water) Fruity spicy vanilla, white pepper heat, orange zest, light syrupy sultanas (w/ water) Caramel, light white pepper tingle, orange zest, light bitter dried stone fruit sweet.

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering ginger/white pepper spice/heat, fruity orange zest, light oak tannins, light bitter burnt sugar sweet (w/ water) Light white pepper tingle, more fruity oaky bitter, lingering warmth.

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting one in that it wasn't quite the sherry bomb I was expecting or hoping for. This seemingly had a more balanced ex-bourbon + sherry oak feel to it. I thought the nose was better without water, had a better initial taste with water, but finished worse with water. I think the water tamed down the heat a bit but brought out some hidden bitterness that was masked by the higher proof. Overall tasty, but not as balanced as I hoped it would be.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe, if the price was right & there wasn't anything else I wanted to try

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another one"

4.0,"Lives up to some of the hype, and a basically the Macallan 12 on flavour roids. 

Sherry on the nose, with a touch of oak, dried fruit and honey. There's cinnamon and tobacco on the palate, with plenty of wood spices. The body is full with a pleasant burn from the high ABV, and the finish has a touch of dark chocolate. 

Considering it's a limited edition, it's definitely worth buying."

3.0,"I don’t really understand this whiskey. It’s just not a pleasant experience overall. It doesn’t taste nearly as good as the Edition No.2 or even the 12 for a similar priced whiskey. It tastes unrefined on the palate, and the finish has some bitterness to it. The high ABV Macallan is always welcomed, but I just wish it can taste a bit better."
4.0,"I’ve been wanting to try this limited release from Macallan for a while, and thanks to @LeeEvolved I now have that chance. Classic Cut is bottled at cask strength of 58.4% ABV, is non chill filtered and natural color of dark copper. 

The nose is powerful. Sweet sherry, heavy raisins and dates and dark cherries. Sherried sawdust...I’m sorry sir I just dropped this bottle of sherry on the floor. That’s ok ma’am, it just so happens I have a bucket full of sawdust from when I ground down my old oak tree stump. Let me just soak up that sherry...that’s what it’s like. Sherried nuts, pecans, walnuts, almonds and cashews. A touch of mint. Being cask strength I had to experiment with some water. Water releases lots of vanilla, toffee, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar and milk chocolate. A little musty, more oak, a light malty character and some concord grapes. 

The palate is even more powerful than the nose. Spicy sherry. Raisins, dates and molasses cookies. Orange oil, tobacco and old leather. A bit okay but balanced. Red berries, cherries and toffee. 

A full bodied mouthfeel that starts smooth, then turns dry, then hot, then mouthwatering. 
The finish is long. Sherry, dry oak that leaves a dusty feeling in the back of the throat, cherries. 

This definitely feels like a cask strength version of the standard 12 year old. Strong and intense flavors that demand water. I added roughly 2-3mL of water per 30mL (1oz.) of whisky. Classic Macallan profile cranked up to 11. A good value for money at around $90 for a cask strength Macallan. I still think I would take the 12 year Double Cask over this one though as I like the higher proportion of American oak that is used. Of course the Rare Cask is better than both but who can afford to make that one a permanent member of their collection? Still I have to give it up for this one. A solid 4.25
Cheers"

4.75,"This one is a permanent part of my collection. An aggressive Macallan!  Thank you!...Everything I love about Macallan, but cranked up! I seldom add water to my scotch, but this sherry monster can handle a few drops beautifully. 

Wonderful nose of toasted candied nuts, orange zest, stewed dark red fruits, vanilla and marzipan. Palate has most of the above flavors with a little pinch of white pepper adding some heat. Shortbread, caramel, toffee, dark chocolate and ripe cherries present as well.  

Christmas spices and clove on the finish carry a welcome warming tingle that should not be confused with an alcohol burn. Delicious. Makes your mouth water and coats your entire mouth with great viscosity and good mouth feel. Very long finish!  Puts a smile on my face every time I place the bottle back on the shelf after a dram that can easily be enjoyed for 35-45 min. 

Great for a cold winter’s evening. It’s not truly Cask Strength, but it effectively serves the purposes of creating something unique in the Macallan line-up for those of us who are up for a challenge."

4.0,"Nose - dark fruits, dark cherry, vanilla, some baked goods, and oddly almost no spice notes.  There's a note of some kind of jelly or jelly doughnut or pie going on here at the finish.  Really loving that note.  

Taste - With most sherry bombs I get more oak and dark notes at the end but with this younger sherry bomb the ending is much more sweet vanilla without half the finish.  Huge vanilla and caramel..it's bringing in a lot of bourbon notes, but while bourbon when they add sherry it feels like a secondary note, the sherry here integrates amazingly.  There is a bit of an oak and just finish note here that's coming up young but while that normally can be either off putting or just leaves me wanting more.  I'm digging it with the bourbon notes.  

I think I'm a fan boy on this one so maybe my score will seem extreme, but of the Macallan's I've had I think this is my hands down favorite.  It's oddly enough nearly the cheapest (12 sherry and 10 fine oak were less).  No shocker that they watered down the 2018 and increased the price, they must have realized they let this one out at a really good and fair price."
