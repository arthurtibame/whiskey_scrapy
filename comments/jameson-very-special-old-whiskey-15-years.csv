4.75,"In the 1970’s and up to 1984, Irish Distillers Limited sold small quantities of Jameson 12YO and 15YO . These were in the green “cognac-like” bottle with a brown label. They were considered a more premium product. The whiskey was distilled at the historic Bow Street distillery in Dublin's Liberties, and to modern tastes would be considered quite heavy. Production ceased in 1984 when they were replaced by Jameson1780 in a similar style bottle.

Nose - Husky, petrol and apricot. Yeasty notes and some plastic as well. Hints of grass and old leather. 
Taste Dark wood mixed with bitter chocolate and heavy coffee. Almonds. An old whiskey taste. 
Finish Medium long. Dry - bitter with strong cask taste - perhaps pine at the end.

Great present, thanks Charlie.
