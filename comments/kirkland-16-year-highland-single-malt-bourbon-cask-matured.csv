3.75,"Nose
Strong cereal notes, earthy and slightly pungent.  A little bit of anise.

Palate
Initial hit of sweetness, immediately replaced by a grainy bitterness, but with a hint of honey.  Some leather and heather present.

Finish
Somewhat lengthy, but bitter.  Transitions into a subtle malty characteristic that hangs around the back of the hard palate.  

Overall, a good price for a 16 year single malt scotch but my preference would be to put that same dollar amount into another style of whisky, or just spend more on a different single malt."
