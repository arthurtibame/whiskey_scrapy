5.0,"Nose- Soft bonfire smoke, peaches in syrup, green herbs (thyme, rosemary), delicate fruits, aged oak, cinnamon spices

Palate- Spiced honey initially, followed by a green vegetal note, washed over by light wispy peat smoke, a wave of tropical fruits and peaches, aged oak, and a spray of the sea 

Finish- Long, rich finish with notes of soft, earthen peat, delicate fruits, subtle kitchen spices, and aged oak


This is a stunner. The nose is a symphony of notes, as my list went on and on. Beautiful balance of aromas. The palate sends you through waves of different flavors, and is rich and delicate at the same time, but overall extremely balanced. One of the longest finishes from a scotch that I can remember as well. Everything in this works perfectly, and I have 0 complaints."
4.75,"I received this wonderful bottle as a birthday gift from my 3 brothers and my 2 sons. I only had one wee dram since I promised to hold the majority of the bottle until we can enjoy it together, but my first impression was that this is an amazing whiskey - so smooth with an almost magical blending of floral, sweet, and light peat flavors. It immediately has earned a spot on my top shelf and I cannot wait to revisit it again when the shelter in place is behind us and we can once again gather with good friends and family.  I am an unabashed fan of Compass Box and this easily outranks 3 Year Old,Circus, and the 2012 Flaming Heart (which had been my favorite CBW)."
4.25,"I thought I'd pick something decent for my 800th tasting which the Project Manager in me was like hmm ahead of schedule which is usually good but maybe not in this situation..anyhow I remembered I had a sample of this and mindful of @PBMichiganWolverine experiences with expensive bottles I handled the dram carefully and made sure no one drank it by mistake. 

It's a very nice drop, mellow light meadish peat. Very well integrated. Solid 4.25 which may have risen higher if I got a chance to work through a bottle."
4.5,"Compass Box Tobias & The Angel

Nose: this wonderful conundrum of sweet and savory. Faint smoke, vegetal peat, violets, pressed flowers, and floral malt. Salami, soy sauce reduction. Wasabi & soy sauce almonds. Soft oak. Notes of sherry and dark fruit start to work there way forward after a little time. Its just gorgeous and seductive....you just don’t want to pull away. It’s like a beach strewn with shells, the longer you linger the more treasure you know you will uncover. 

Palate: Exquisite. Soft delicate seduction. Nuance and complexity are the name
of the game with the pedigree of its barrel ages controlling the show. Its a elegant balance of brine and sweet and savory. A touch of light honey and sweet malt dressed in sheer smoke. Rich floral, rose hips, bitter chocolate, almonds, the peat rolls in at the end more woody and earthy with a rich kick of gentle barrel spice. A kiss of velvety smoke ties it all up with a bow. 
Finish: sweet malt and smokey and lingers beautifully with a light touch of sour oak on the end."
5.0,"So there’s a lesson to be learned here...I’ll let y’all readers figure out what that is.
But the story goes like this:
Being that this is such a pretty bottle, with classic artwork as the label, I had it sitting in my home office bookshelf, nestled nicely between Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones.  Last week, we also had quite a few friends and family over, for celebrating  Diwali.  Now, I made available plenty of options for my guests—-red wine, white wine, two mid-tier safe single malts ( Balvenie 12 and Macallan Classic 2019) and even alcohol free cocktails using Seedlip.  But my wife, who can’t tell the difference between Coors Light and a Macallan Genesis, thought this bottle of Compass Box Tobias would look so pretty sitting right behind the homemade samosas.  She was right...looked damn pretty.  But...who puts out a $400 bottle in the open as a free for all???!!!  Needless to say, before I even realized what happened, someone opened it, and by the time I saw it, there was just a small few sips worth of a pour left.  

But those few sips were amazing.  What you have here are two old single malts (Caol Ila and Clyneish , both I think over 30yrs or close to it).  Smooth silky smoke threads through waxy fruit of apples and pears.  Just a drop of water opens up a bit more smoke—-making this much more austere.  

As disheartening as it is...I’m glad I did get to try it.  Interestingly—both the Balvenie and Macallan were left untouched and unopened."

4.0,"So first pour isn't done yet.

first note - wow dusty and spicy. Shockingly odd just from opening the bottle.

That fades and yields cream and lightly earth tones. with vanilla and citrus.

man - the earthy dark peaty big super old caol and the bright fruity clynelish are almost fighting vs playing nicely with each other. Opens with citrus, turns to the smoke/peat and finishes spicy and citrus floral with I believe sherry kinda dancing over the whole thing
and then a long lingering finish that requires old whisky to create.

This has some of the best notes I get in old scotch but it's almost too sweat in a pudding like fashion. I really want the darker peat notes to be a hair stronger here.

For now I'll give this an 85 out of 100. Mid B which is heavily weighted by the high price. But never review a whisky by the neck pour."
null,"Asked a couple of retailers to check with their distributors on this expensive limited edition. Happy to report #376 of 2,634 is mine. These will be hard to find and retailers in NY and CA are already gouging with a price of $800 a pop. I was very happy to get this for $425, so if you’re a CB fan, you need to be proactive to score one."
