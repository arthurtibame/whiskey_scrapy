3.0,"A definite step up from the T & S Reserve. The heirloom wheat gives it a more consistent sweetness throughout and a thicker mouthfeel. Just a hint of smoke and old leather with a mild finish. Their website seems to target this one to women looking to get into the whiskey world with the tag line ""a kinder spirit"". I can definitely see this one being a good change of pace in traditional whiskey cocktails. As a note to the original review, I've purchased 2 bottles and have had no issues with sediment."
