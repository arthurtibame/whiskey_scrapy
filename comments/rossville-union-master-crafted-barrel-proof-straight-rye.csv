4.25,"All the classic mgp rye characteristics here. Very spicy rye, cinnamon clove and pepper standout. Vanilla is faint but present. Decent finish. Overall well done just wish it was 2 yrs older, is estimate is about 4 yrs old. 4 stars not cheap so try before you buy"

4.0,"Back home in AZ after a fruitful week in Charlotte and I have the pleasure of trying out this dram that I have hunted for a while. Shout out to @Swahili1 for the recommendation. 
As a fan of the sweeter MGP rye expressions (especially at barrel proof) I was eager to give this one a try. For background this is an MGP owned product line and their first barrel proof rye release that was not sourced. It clocks in at a not too shabby 112.6 proof and is part of an 86 barrel batch. It's a limited annual release and this one was the 2018. Per MGP it's an expertly blended rye from their best reserves. The average age is 4 yrs old (source is Fred Minnick). On to the tasting:
On the pallette what really jumps out is just how damn smooth it is for a barrel proof Whiskey. It kicks off with clove kick that quickly moves to candied ginger and orange peels. Mid pallette has a an array of baking spices with a slight cocoa note that transitions in a long honey and spice filled finish that is very long. It just rolls on and on with a lingering pepper tingle on the tongue. Good pour this one for sure. It's really reminds a lot of the Templeton Barrel Proof, just a little more reserved. I would say for the same money, I think the Templeton is a shade better. It's almost an identical profile (also MGP Distillate) just a bit more flavor and viscosity. I am guessing the Templeton includes older stock. Since I rate the Templeton a 4.5 I will knock 0.5 points of this one and give it a solid 4/5. Buy recommendation for any Rye fan. Cheers all!"

4.0,"Not the best MGP Barrel Proof Rye I’ve ever had, but the best one I’ve had for $60, and that’s no slight. A GREAT way to spend $60 these days..."
4.25,"Neat.  Careful burying your nose in this high proof.  Lots of rye, cinnamon, nutmeg and hint of mint on the nose.  The more I smell I get hints of pie crust and pastries.  Medium mouth feel and that spice hits the tongue immediately and then transitions to mostly sweetness.  The taste punches you in the face.  Lots of lingering vanilla.  Really good legs but lots of tingle and numbing too."
4.25,"Delicious.  Nice balanced nose.  Lots of vanilla and floral.  High alcohol but nose has zero burn.  Strong rye, sweet flavors with a medium length and hotness."
4.5,"Excellent.Peppery, toffee, slightly chewy, perfect amount of heat.  Best rye in my arsenal"

4.0,"Everything you want a rye to be. Nice on the nose, slight cherry aroma. Mild clove spice and the proof brings home a warm punch in the chest. This is a solid rye."

5.0,"A seriously good whiskey that has opened my eyes to quality rye.  Normally I shy away from the spice and prefer wheated bourbons but this one was different.  A super well balanced flavor bomb that intrigued at every sip.  

Nose:  Creme Brule, vanilla, and pastry.  A wonderful nose that doesnt hint of alcohol.

Palate:  Loads of caramel and sweet vanilla.  Gives way to a flan like custard taste and then the spice comes in.

Finish: Bakery spices balanced with rye.  Burn is hot but not overly done.

I tried neat in glen cairn and then chilled in fridge for 15 minutes with 1 small cube of ice made it even better."

2.5,"Briny, almost fishy, nose. With furniture polish. This is a floral, herbal rye, classic MGP profile. Sweetness flows in, especially at the end. A turpentine note as well. 6/21/19"

4.5,"Carmel, slight cherry on the front end. 
Vanilla on the end. 
Surprisingly easy sipper for a barrel proof rye. Small splash of water really opens it up."
4.25,"Fantastic, I would keep this on the shelf at my home bar as a staple for old fashioned and manhattans! Cherry, citrus and rye bread. Delightful"

4.25,Love the heat in this rye. Surprisingly smooth for a barrel strength. Caramel upfront and some late licorice and vanilla. Back of tongue gets molasses/burnt caramel flavors. Big fan!

3.0,"So MGP as best I understand is putting out their own juice, about time! 

Nose - There's a green note, I'm not sure how to explain it.  Often I get dill with rye but I'm getting the normal opening notes but it doesn't turn to dill.  The sweet notes are pretty simple, not a cane sugar, a touch of caramel, it's clean and neat.  There's a warmth of the spice but very little if any oak.  

Taste - Oh it's powerful.  You get that rye flavor, then you get light gentle oak, vanilla, then back to spicy rye.  This is rye through and through.  There's a nice caramel coming in as well.  It's weird, these notes outside of the spice are very much bourbon, but this is through and through rye.  

A bit younger than I'd like and I forget the price.  I'd buy this for sure.  It's a quintessential example of a barrel proof rye.  As I've said before, I'm not a rye guy but this is a sold 3.0 and I might be underrating it.  I just wish it was a few years older with some more oak notes, but that's I think more me."

4.25,"Oh my god this is good.  Cheers to @dubz480 for sending over a pour.  I had to add a bit of water, and let it sit out while watching “Stranger Things “ tonight, but wow...after a while, the aromas really blossom.  

What’s surprising is that despite it being MGP sourced, I’m not getting that dill aroma or taste.  Instead, on the nose, cool mint, eucalyptus, and ...vetiver?  Taste is an extension of the aromas.  More of that same mint and vetiver, but with a tinge of heat. 

At $60, this punches above its class.  You can do much worse for more money, but not much better for the same price.  

Thanks @dubz480 for the generous sample!"
4.5,"Different taste than most Ryes we’ve had. Not a spicy, but not as sweet. Balanced. Different, but good."

4.25,Smooth for higher proof
4.5,"Bottle 230/240. Savory batch. Very smooth up front, dark fruits, pastry and baker spice. With a long finish that has a touch of vanilla. Not what I expected for a rye!"

4.5,"Aroma: buttery caramel, cherry, oak and some baking spice

Flavor: delightfully complex, rye spice, caramel, cherry and a good amount of oak and white tea flavor that carries through to the finish

Overall: fantastic rye that has so much complexity and surprising range of flavor. For a $60 barrel proof rye it's definitely worth it"
4.25,Crisp and Light but rich.
4.0,"Smell: typical rye /vanilla
Taste: starts soft... gets sharp in the middle... then lingering finish
More complex than the 94 proof"
