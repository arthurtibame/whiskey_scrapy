4.25,"The first drink I had this year after resolving to avoid cask strength first-fill single barrels was a cask strength first-fill single barrel. My excuse for this inconsistency is that it was a Springbank and therefore exempt from any restrictions, be they financial, medical or philosophical. This one was distilled in 2003 and matured for 13 years in a “fresh” sherry cask. Just 474 bottles of 58.6% spirit were released for the U.S. market in 2017, presumably from a sister cask to the 700 ml bottling listed separately on Distiller. 

The nose starts off with a small but pleasant hint of sulphur, a bit of the classic Springbank funk and a handful of baked oats. Diluting it to 50% unlocks earthy aromas of a damp forest. It’s complex and warming and I could happily explore it all evening. I was braced for this to taste like an overpowering sherry bomb, but the neat spirit is surprisingly dry on the tongue, with flavors of caramelized pecans, mushroom soup and soy sauce, and it’s easy drinking despite the strength. The finish is long and tangy, and longer still with water, which brings out spicy, umami flavors like Twiglets (Google it, my American friends.) 

Springbank limited releases are always fun to try because they are typically a well balanced mix of the distillery’s funk and peat and the flavors of whatever crazy cask took their fancy. This one didn’t disappoint."
