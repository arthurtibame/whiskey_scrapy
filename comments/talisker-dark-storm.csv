Great product, if you love the 10 you'll love this. 10 is more briney and fruity, this is more dark and smokey."

4.0,"The nose on this is special! So much so that once you taste it you get a little disappointed.  Dark storm is a great name when the nose is so alive and fresh. You get those peat and briny notes but there something else going on - spice and smoke warn you that you are not safe here....the clouds are rolling in and the seas are angry.....but this tastes to me like young spirits not uncouth but lacking in character. Yes there is nice spice from oak...and charred casks give this its main character but you can't get past the lack of depth on display. So you get a sweet vanilla and oak tannin mixed with smoke and its all very nice and ordered but I feel it misses the salt of the 10 year old and the thrills. It’s a very nice dram don’t get me wrong but just lacks the complexity where it matters and this holds it back. If the taste matched the nose this would be something to get really excited about. So in the end - nice and interesting, with a nose to die for but just short of outstanding. 3.5 stars or 91."

5.0,"This review basically could be condensed down into a cross-reference to my prior review of Talisker Storm, with the caveat that this whisky has more assertive notes of barbecue smoke, sweet caramel, and chili pepper.  I tried this in an airport duty-free shop, which is the main place that you can find this travel retail exclusive.  Compared to Storm, Dark Storm strikes its notes with more power and clarity, which makes it the better pick in my book.  It's surprising that two scotches bottled at the same ABV and aged using similar techniques (apparently the main difference is a higher char level for this expression) could differ so much in perceived strength.  Blind, I would have guessed this was an amped-up, 50% ABV version of Storm."

4.0,"Nose: A rich, earthy and oily smokiness that is bold and assertive but not sharp. A satisfying feast of spicy stewed fruit and bacon cooked over a driftwood campfire on a windswept beach with thunderheads brooding on the horizon. The dry glass is smoke, but not Islay smoke - more heathery and gentle.

Palate: Perfectly sweetly astringent (now *that's* a trick to pull off!), iodine, and stewed fruit flavours peeking from behind the couch in anticipation of pouncing. Not complex, but deep and rewarding with a firm but subtle underlying oakiness.

Finish: Long, smoky, salty and altogether divine.

I could drink this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I very much enjoy Talisker expressions, especially the 10 and 18 year, but this adds a confident, mature smokiness to the normal distillery character.

Not long ago I described Bowmore Tempest as a roaring typhoon, but this is an altogether more different, introspective  type of storm.  Pour a dram of this and settle back in front of the fire to watch the rain lash the windows. 4 stars without hesitation. Don't hurry this one - savour every drop.

ADDENDUM - The official Distiller tasting notes are right on target, but a score of 84 is too stingy. Talisker Skye was given 85 for heaven’s sake and this is way better. Higher 80s, at least, around the same as Storm.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.0,"Original review from Sept 2016 (transferred from Barreled):

I just completed a very enjoyable side by side comparison between this Dark Storm and it's squall of a cousin, Storm.  Check out my full review and comparo over there if you are so inclined.

I'm doing a quick update here on the Dark Storm because I added a couple of drops to this one just to see if I could find something else here.  The regular Storm had a bigger flavor profile and I want to see if I could dig a little deeper for something hidden in this Dark Storm.

It seems like there's maybe a strange hint of dark berries on the nose that really surprised me that I didn't notice before.  The smoke snatches it away so quick that I fear I may be imagining it.

The remaining sip still coats the tongue being rich and oily and it finishes very smooth.  Good stuff.  I recommend you try them both.  Thanks for the sample, @Generously_Paul.  Cheers."
4.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from March 2016

A nice NAS from Talisker. Typical 45.8% ABV. Nice dark amber color from the heavily charred casks being used (I think it's natural color, but not sure). Smoky and sweet on the nose with vanilla and oak  spices and the unmistakable Talisker briny but also peppery maritime sea air.  I get a taste of an overdone/burnt BBQ chicken. The palate has more of a charred character than smoky, but smoky nevertheless. The signature Talisker peppery spice makes itself known right away. The BBQ comes in again. The finish is spicy/peppery and quite dry with decent length. Not as well rounded as the 10 YO but still very good, especially if you enjoy the huge Talisker punch to the face.  4.25"

3.75,"A darker dram from Isle of Skye and Talisker.

You'll see this one plenty if you are travelling and my bottle was bought from Copenhagen Airport and gifted to me. It definitely stands out in its profile in taste too. A no-age statement whisky and matured in heavily charred casks.

Nose for me was quite subtle with definite smoke and pepper and a touch of citrus at the end.

Usually on my palate I pick up oak at the end on, but here it comes at you from the start. I'd say oak with a more roasted aroma rather than say a nutty aroma.
Joining the oak is of course smoke and a burning feel of chili, rounded off by some sweet honey.

The finish is full, long and lingering with plenty of roasted tones and black pepper, that charred barrel and lastly the Talisker maritime seasalt ending.

I enjoy this dram and I don't think I've had a whisky that has this black pepper profile like the Dark Storm.

4.5,"On the nose: 

Peat. (Not the cigarrete smoke, more like johnnie walker red ""stinky"" peatyness)
Vanilla cream. 
Mountain forest (eucaliptus maybe)
Citrus aroma somewhere. Its oranges (discovered after adding water)
Grapes purple

Very very very strong dram. Very different from skye. Lots of wood. Old wood, fire, smoke and a bitter sensation. Very powerful, not so pleasant finish but long and strong. Oakiness, lots of spices. Full bodied. 

I had to pour some drops of water to discover more and to finish it. It is almost what we called in Ecuador a ""PURO""  which is straight alcohol. Although no alcohol aroma or taste is present, it feels like a ""puro"" because of its strong power (45.8% abv) (just as skye but this othe one is smooth and lovely). 

Dark storm is a great name for it. It feels like a strong storm in a boat, very scary. 

Update: added some water: same flavor. More spices come up but much more pleasant. You shouldn't need to add water to enhace a whisky.  Some caramel appeared now. The finish is still powerful.90 over 100"
