4.5,"As I work my way farther back with the Laphroaig Feis Ile Cairdeas releases, I find myself enjoying the history behind the bottles just as much as the whisky itself.  This is the 2012 release, subtitled:  Origin Edition.  It’s named this based on the fact that they used a portion of the blend from the original Cairdeas blends that came before it:  aged 13-21 years in ex-bourbon casks.  There’s also quarter casked, 7 year old juice providing the majority of the blend.  There were 3,000 bottles available the day of the festival and these days you must search the auction houses to find the few that remain.  I’ve purchased 2 bottles over the last year or two, one I had to pay $300 to win and the other I snagged, while most bidders were preoccupied I guess, for $159.  It’s bottled at 51.2% ABV and isn’t chill filtered or colored.

It’s a light straw in the tasting glass and makes some lightning fast legs and thin drops on the rim after a spin.  The nose is dominated by leather, bandaids and smoked bacon.  There’s a hint of raisin-like sweetness and eucalyptus/aloe gel creating a crazy funk, mixed with earthy peat after an extended rest in the glass.  It wasn’t overly smoky and everything seemed muted and well entangled.  The youthful whisky didn’t overpower the older stuff, so maybe the exact blended amounts were closer to 50/50 than I would’ve guessed.

The palate showcases typical-Laphroaig, meaty smoke and bandaid funk, with earthy minerals.  The elevated ABV was also very well hidden- at no point does it seem hot.  There was even a citrus and berry sweetness around mid sip- very unexpected.  It really was mouth watering and refreshing.  The finish was long, smoky and leathery.  There was a lingering zest and I had to chase away the medicinal notes with some water after several minutes.  It felt like I had wrapped a used bandaid around my tongue after 10-15 minutes.  I really wanted that flavor gone at that point, lol.

Overall, I love the fact that this bottle contained some pretty old Laphroaig.  You gotta think that back before the current whisky craze, distilleries put older stuff out to market a whole lot more liberally just because they wanted things to be as good as could be and didn’t know that they could’ve sold this stuff for a huge mark up if they had just held onto it for another 5-6 years.  That same 21yo whisky could’ve been released as a single malt in 2018 as a 27yo with an asking price of $650.  And while this Cairdeas isn’t experimental, it is a fantastic representation of Laphroaig and signals their respect and love for fans of their whisky.  This one rates a 4.25 rating, with a slight bump just because it has some two decade old juice in it.  4.5 stars.  If you’re a Laphroaig fanboy, like me, do yourself a favor and save up and search for these old Feis Ile bottles.  They’re really good and have a great story to tell.  Cheers, my friends."

4.0,"Another treat pulled from the sample stockpile, this is the oldest Cairdeas I have tried to date. The nose is outstanding: warm apricots and plums, heather, leather-bound books, smoked meats and a touch of mint. In the mouth, there’s peppery peat, menthol, sweet raisins and a gentle chocolate note. So far, outstanding. The only thing that knocks it back a star for me are the dry tannins in the finish, which is otherwise long and peppery. That oakiness is the hallmark of the quarter casks and the one characteristic of the Laphroaig stock that I don’t really care for. Whenever I encounter them in Laphroaig, I find they dominate the finish and break the reverie from what preceded it. If you’re okay with that, then this is a five-star whisky. For me, it’s merely great."
4.0,"This is the oldest of the Cairdeas series that I've tried so far, enough so that it dates back to my graduation from law school, in the dark ages when the only scotch I drank was Black Label.  While the more recent iterations of this annual series have become a paean to different finishing techniques, particularly various sweet wine or dessert wine finishes, this Cairdeas seems very different.  It hones in on the core Laphroaig flavors, while also adding a unique twist.  The nose's strongest note is, of course, smoke, but there is a lingering air of sweet honey-roasted peanuts, reminiscent of the nut carts that line the broadways of New York.  The palate is briny, has a sharp, cutting lemon note, and also features some creamy, nutty flavors.  Pine nuts may be what I'm getting here.  The finish is warming, smoky, long as any Laphroaig, and has a glimmer of tropical fruits.  This is a nice one, worthy of the line as a whole.  Am I ever going to find a Cairdeas that I don't love?  It's Laphroaig, so probably not."
