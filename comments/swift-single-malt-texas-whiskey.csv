4.0,"I loved this stuff. Then I met the nicest people in the world making it and I was hooked. Sweet nose of reduced cream , flowers and vanilla then bright fruit (quince,citrus).  Balanced finish. I can't wait to get the next batch with a little more time in the barrel..."
5.0,I love the new SWIFT Single Malt Whiskey! Smooth as anything I've tasted.
5.0,"I loved this whisky from the first taste! I agree that it is young and I know it will only get better! The nose is a blossom of sweetness, a malted barley bouquet! It is almost like perfume! The taste is bright and the sharpness of the alcohol hits your tongue briefly, then it melts to a sweetness that is fruity, laced with vanilla and a tangy, almost citrusy burst. The finish is short, encouraging another sip to experience this fresh Malt Whisky all over again."

4.0,"SWIFT Single Malt Whiskey, is excellent.   Thanks. Terry"
5.0,"Great Whiskey. Smooth and the Spanish sherry cask that it is aged in gives it a rich flavor.  From the quality of the whiskey to the bottle label, the attention to detail is apparent.  Highly Recommended"

4.0,"Edit: I got a new bottle, and I can honestly say that it is far more impressive than the first bottle I had. The tasting notes on Distiller are pretty close to what I get, with a few additions. The nose is a bit more floral now, like honeysuckle. I also get some lemon, black tea, and a nice tanic quality on the palate. It's still a young spirit, so it is a bit hot, vibrant, and effervescent. This is a well made whiskey, and was worth trying again. Leaving my original notes below.
  
(Original notes follow)  I really wanted to love this, but it wasn't worth the price tag in the end. I'm willing to believe that the bottle I had just wasn't good, but there was just an off flavor throughout. I want to attribute it to cask selection, as the spirit itself was malty and flavorsome, but that funky undercurrent was there. I'll try this again another time, because I like supporting Texas distillers. Just for comparison, this was $50 in College Station."
5.0,"Very light color, but a stronger flavor than might be expected. Strong malt notes. Nice finish, longer than the Distiller tasting notes give it credit for. A very nice start for this Texas producer."

5.0,"Really love this single malt whiskey which is so reminiscent of Scotch! The distillers at Swift are so committed to the craft! I would think this was easily a 10 year bottling if I did not know otherwise! The Scottish barley, the distillers' passion & knowledge, the bourbon and sherry casks combined with the Texas heat have created a fantastic whiskey!"

4.5,Easily one of my favorite Texas whiskeys. The sherry makes a huge presence on the nose along with red berries. That’s caries through the taste with the classic single malt taste but red berries make a big presence. Some vanilla and caramel but not as much as most whiskeys. It’s also creamy like an Irish whiskey. Finish is like an Irish as well.

3.25,"Interesting young single malt. Relatively one dimensional but not bad for a newer craft distillery. Plus it was $16 for the bottle so good deal regardless. Nose is buttery with light pepper notes and some fruitiness that sort of reminds me of white wine. Really unique for a whiskey. Taste is honey, apples, pepper and a bit of sherry on the short finish. Kinda boring, but would make a great hot weather sipper."
