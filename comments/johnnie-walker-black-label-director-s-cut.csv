null,"This particular blend is very unique to the usual Johnnie lineup. I enjoyed 2049 over an ice sphere in a Johnnie Walker rocks glass(On a side note, the glass is perfect for holding the sphere in place due in part from it's inverted cone bottom).  I took some and rubbed it in my hands, ah sweet and smokey. As I'm typing this I'm itching to pour out another two fingers. The tastes are abundantly clear and seemed to bounce back and fourth on my tongue. Each new sip brought a new flavor that I will try to comment on after I finish the bottle. At $65, I was more than pleased with this blend."

5.0,"Enjoying some JW Blade Runner Edition while watching Blade Runner 2049.

Here’s some notes:

Rich honey colored, medium bodied, with a velvety mouthfeel.

Nose: soft and sweet - toasted marshmallow, vanilla, a pinch of sea salt. a hint of fruit, possibly raisins & dates. Some mild smoke is present as well. 

Palate: starts with some fruity sweetness and a touch of marshmallow. The middle grows more complex with layers of sweet tobacco smoke and some heat. The finish is long on this one- lingering sweetness from the beginning with billows of camp smoke adding complexity and richness. 

This whisky is tasty, complex, and rich. A thoroughly enjoyable blend - which I far prefer to it’s cousin the regular Johnnie Walker black label. The higher proof and slightly different blend makes for a more interesting whisky. 

My only complaint is that it’s a limited release."

4.0,"Nose - Light sweet peat, over-steeped black tea, clean grain alcohol sweetness, hint of cognac leather.

Taste - Nice black & white pepper spice/tingle, hint of a dark fruity sherried Scotch, dark dried stone fruits, dark barrel aged apple cider oaky sweet, faint hint of fruity smoke, dark honey.

Finish - Lingering white pepper tingle, light fruity smoke, sweet dark honey/dried fruit sweetened black tea.

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite pleasant. I haven't personally had Black Label very often, but from what I recall, this definitely packs a bit more of a punch in the flavor department. I think it has a bit more of a fruity component than the standard Black label and the higher proof helps with the mouthfeel too. It feels more mouth coating versus the thin feeling of the standard Black. The fruit cuts the smoke so that it's a very faint player in the background which is nice.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - No, not at the current price"
4.0,Truly an outstanding blend if you like Caol Ila and Talisker you will love this beautiful whiskey. As an additional note I have read many reviews in this one where it incorrectly states this very Limited Edition is not numbered.  This is incorrect! Every bottle is numbered on the back of the bottle and mine for the record is # 4322
5.0,"If only this were $30 cheaper and more available. This is a special-occasion whiskey. Watching Blade Runner 2049 is a special occasion. It's like a more intense version of JW Black in every sense of the word. More heat, more peat, more sweet, more salt, more malt. It makes me wish JW would borrow the extra 3% ABV idea from the Green and roll with it if it means getting that much closer to this. You can tell it's a blend, but you don't really care. Neat all the way on this but playing around with a single cube or a couple drops of water help make it more cohesive and enjoyable when you go back to it neat."
