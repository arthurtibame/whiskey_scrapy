null,"Nose: Apple, kiwi and orange are soon joined by creamier vanilla notes, rounded wood spices and a touch of pepper. Inviting.

Palate: Superb balance of fruit, oak and barley. Fruit Salads develop, frangipane too, hints of cape gooseberry and finally soft caramel.

Finish: Grapefruit and caramel tart. Nuttier with a wisp of smoke on further sips, but never fully losing that touch of juicy fruit."

4.5,"Wow...its like pure honey mead or dessert ice wine. In fact if someone told me it was the latter I'd believe them. The 40% helps but still it's like I'm not even drinking whiskey. Bit of nutmeg, spice, vanilla, white grape/wine and more. Very interesting dram. I was thinking after drinking a raft of average drams my palate was off but now it just doesn't tolerate mediocrity that well anymore. I had rinsed out my glass prior but this tolerates zero water so I thoroughly dried and had another pour and was rewarded further. 4.25 - 4.5. Now I wouldn't say its 5 territory as its missing at least 6% abv and whilst complex it's not 5 level. Also it feels its a bit too refined to mass market duty free level. Plus I wouldn't pay $220 USD a bottle. Balvanie is moving up to my top 10 distillers."

4.5,"Do zestawienia swojego dzieła David Stewart wykorzystał whisky starzoną przez dwie dekady w beczkach dębowych którą na ostatni okres maturacji przelał do beczek po Maderze .

Nos.

Wonny , owocowo - floralny , świeży sok ananasowy , pikantna nuta imbiru , syrop waniliowy .

Smak.

Soczysty , sałatka z tropikalnych owoców , migdałowe cukierki , cynamon i delikatne nuty wanilii.

Finisz.

Długi i soczysty , słodkie nuty słodowe , pokłady wanilii i korzennych przypraw."

3.75,"Well of course this is delicious. And smooth. And velvety. It’s a Balvenie after all, aged 21 years. But I have to say, I was underwhelmed particularly at this price point. I just expect more from a $200 plus bottle. And the abv is low. Between this and the portwood I’d absolutely take the portwood. 

As for the taste, it has a pleasant honey, light fruit and some underlying Madeira spice that gives this a somewhat unique taste. It’s just a little muted. I wonder what this would be like at 46%."
