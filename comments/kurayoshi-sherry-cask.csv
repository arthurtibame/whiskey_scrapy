2.75,"Color is a light amber. Nose is strong with citrus, honey, and berries radiating from the glass. Vanilla and malt are found past the initial wave. First sip is almost zesty, with a milt tingle amidst some maltiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, not thin or viscous. Further sips reveal a subtle berry note, as well as some grassy notes. Finish is a wave of acidity that leaves the tongue with a lemon like flavor, but without the freshness of fresh lemon. Overall, the nose is great, but the palate and finish leave plenty to be desired."

4.0,"Got this to try as something unique I can’t normally get while on a trip overseas. At first glance, I was a little disappointed. I wasn’t expecting a twist cap for a pricey whisky and it’s light color made its age very evident but that quickly changed upon sipping it. Couldn’t get a whole lot of info off the bottle other than it being a sherry cask and was 43% ABV because everything else is Japanese. I have to admit thought that may be what drew me in, the mystery and my love for the sherry cask stuff. This is one definitely unique in my opinion and I have a hard time putting a label on all the scents and flavors I get. It is floral and fruity without the slightest hint of peat and I can it has the usual characteristics of a sherry cask though I would not call it a “sherry bomb”. I seem to get a lot of chocolate particularly on the nose and the occasional hint of what I can only describe as sake. Overall, I wouldn’t say I knocked it out of the park on my purchase but I am anything but disappointed and it hit the mark of the goal I was going for. For me it’s a good bottle to share and talk about with my friends that’s not so readily available to us."

3.5,Very floral on the nose. Spicy on the tongue. Smooth. Not as much sherry as other sherry cask whiskey. Good bottle.
