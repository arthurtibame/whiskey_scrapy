4.0,"Smokey and spicy, good balance"
3.75,"Not a peaty Scotch, but great flavor nonetheless. If you like Scotch that isn't peaty you'd absolutely love Mossburn- others will still appreciate it for (despite the lack of peat) it's cask tasteful palate finished with a sea salty, minuscule burn, but an overall smooth, delicious experience."
