4.0,"Nose. Sweet fudge. Sherry. Burnt sugar. Fairly complex. Mostly great, but there is a hint of something unpleasant at times (read manure). 
Mouth. Less complex. Still burnt sugar. Albeit weaker. Vanilla. Lots of peppery oak.
Finish. A bit bitter. The burnt sugar without the sweetness. Chocolate. Great for a short while. Dies quickly with only bitterness left.
Fairly interesting whisky. Many impressions for little money. Not for the one looking for a smooth trip, but rather for someone looking for interesting."
