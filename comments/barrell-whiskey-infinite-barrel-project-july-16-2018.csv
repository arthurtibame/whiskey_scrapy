2.5,"Nose is fairly weak, but defined mostly by vanilla, light bronzed caramel, and maybe a hint of cloved red apple. The taste (surprisingly) leans into this apple direction, followed by some interesting spices washing over the back end. However, the ABV ends up dominating the party. Overall, the dram feels loud and young. Not unpleasant, but definitely lacking in complexity."

4.0,So much going on here. The nose is rye spice and Scotch fruit. The palate starts off fruit and sweet with some vanilla then transitions to spice. The finish is spicy and long. This is a complex whiskey with a lot to say. I like it.
