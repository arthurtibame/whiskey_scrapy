4.5,Windy and Foggy. To be drinked in lonely night
3.5,"When you read this i want you to feel my dissapointment. I know what to expect in an Islay or Island Whisky, i hope for it and i found nothing near of that in Jura's Diurach's Own 16 yo.

More boring and simple than its very wonderful siblings, Superstition and Origin, made me wonder if Jura should sell the younger models at a higher price and this one at a lower price. 

Let me get this clear, it is a good dram, just not excelent. Superstition And Origin were amazing. 

On the nose is very elegant, with Vanilla in a beautiful way and macadamian nuts. Maybe some Caramel BUT ALMOST NO PEAT. No peat in an Islay or Island whisky is like playing soccer without the goal. Nothing else happens on the nose, i can tell you it smells sweet and delicious but no fireworks are fired here.

On the palate it has nothing to do with the profile told on the box. It is Hot, rough, with dry brown grasses, woody, nutty, with a long hot finish, not easy to enjoy.  The real problem here: it was kind of boring. 

I had to make it a little better so i tried adding 2 mini drops of water and it helped a lot. On the nose i discovered honey, Caramel and Chocolate, without firing fireworks either.

On the palate it was most improved, releasing all this beatiful spicyness that dance all over your mouth, resembling like licking a ""crazy dips"" lollipop, but in this case the spices (ginger and black pepper) are the ones that ""sparkle"" in your tongue.There is also a tobacco note on the palate after adding water. Finish is long, full bodied. bottled at 40% but is very rough very oily, no Islay or Island profile at all. Its color is chesnut. 

Overall it is a good whisky, but not the ultra mega great whisky i was hoping it to be. Maybe its my fault for having great expectations, but it was because its two predecessors were amazing."

4.0,"Nose: Spicy but smooth. Herbs and orange peel. Cinnamon and small hints of vanilla. Water adds more herbal and floral feel.

Taste: Very salty, yet with some sweetness as well. Bitter with oak and dark chocolate. Nutty.

Finish: Smooth, just like the nose, spicy and herbal. Nice warm feeling of gingerbread dough rises.

Balance: Spicy, yet smooth, interesting dram. Suits better for my mouth, than Jura 10 yrs or Superstition, which are more heavy with spices."

3.5,"The quality of this fairly complex and engaging Single Malt from the Isle of Jura is clearly diminished by intense coloring (E150a) and its low bottling strength of 40% ABV. Orange peel, dark fruits and toffee can be found on the nose, supplemented by heather honey, ginger and a hint of salt. Jura 16 arrives heavy, sweet and full-bodied with rich spices, bitter chocolate and some well-integrated, earthy cask influence in the development. The finish is delicate, prolonged and bitter spicy. However, given the lack of intrinsic quality, this whisky is overpriced.

RATING: 3.5/5.0 stars ≙ 83 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE"

3.0,"On the Nose:  Honey, walnuts and toffee with some wood notes in the background. Dried fruit as well. Water definitely opens things up a bit, making things a touch sweeter (just don't drown it). 

In the Glass:  Golden Brown. 

Taste:  Definitely some nuts going on here, almost like it was matured inside a huge hazelnut shell (and this isn't a bad thing). 
Toffee and caramel flavors dominate the finish, though this one finishes more bitter than sweet.  

The 10 year old Origin always tasted like it had to be forced out of its casks, kicking and screaming, begging mom for just a little bit longer... The extra 6 years shows that it was on to something."

2.0,"It is taking me time to properly evaluate this dram. My first impression upon opening the bottle was ""nothing special"" and a slight disappointment. There was a lot of earthiness and very little rich sweet notes and complexity. My second try after a couple of days, is a little better. I read somewhere that this whiskey needs a bit of time in the bottle to fully open up. Leaving it sitting in the glass is not doing much improvement. I will probably update this once I have more time with it. 

Few weeks later: slight change to the better, water helps the situation."

3.0,"I'm going through my batches of Drinks by the Dram (about 5 more to go).   The last one (Yoichi NAS) was a disappointment, was hoping a bit better from this one.   Personally, I love the Islands.  Something about their briny, salty, yet sweet flavor.  Probably my favorite region overall.   First whiff does indicate a better experience to come than the Yoichi.  I can smell salted caramel.  No smoke or peat.  Taste is more salt, less caramel.  Also getting ripe bananas and chocolate, but really  the salt is overwhelming anything else.   Finish is sweet briny, tinge of bitter.  Like dark chocolate covered with flakes of salt.   Not bad...would I buy a full bottle?  Probably not.  It seems to be pulling its punches, and yet not complex enough to get away with it.  If I want the salt briny profile, I'll go for the Talisker 10."

4.0,"Diurachs are the inhabitants of Jura, and this whisky honors them.  It's a higher-end expression from the distillery, aged a somewhat atypical 16 years.  That age is immediately evident on the nose, which has a rosy musk that isn't present in the younger expressions.  Leather, rosewater, grapefruit, and cereal.  This would make a decent cologne.  The first thing I noticed when sipping it is its oily texture, which is much fuller-bodied and flavor-packed than I'd expect at just 40% alcohol.  It's lavender-infused oil, candied sweets, oak, and floral malt again.  The finish features café au lait and caramel corn for a lovely coda.  The three phases don't quite cohere for me, as the floral nose transitions into a very sweet and woody palate, whereas the finish seems like a great combination of sherry, ex-bourbon, new oak, and malt flavors.  Those final notes are the high water mark of this whisky and, in my experience thus far, of this distillery's single malts.  I wonder what the effect of upping the ABV would be, or perhaps peating this whisky."

Palate: dangerously smooth, oak spices, plums, old fashioned dry ginger ale.

Finish: Longer than expected, But also woodier and quite bitter.

I preferred this without water, which only seemed to dull its positive attributes. Mostly uninspiring.

Dry glass: sweet lightly toasted white bread."

2.25,"I got this and two other Jura sample bottles on the travel retail market. As 2018 has ended this has been discontinued apparently. Matured for the first 14 years in American White Oak barrels and the last 2 years in ex-Amoroso Oloroso sherry casks.

On the nose I picked up some of that American oak from a hint of caramel, I had to let the dram breathe a bit after nosing the first time. 

My first sip introduced me directly to oak notes that transitioned into new wood, which then was followed by all spice. It has a prickling burn to it, more than I would expect from a 40% ABV.

The finish was rather swift with mixed nuts and lots and lots of malted barley. Topped off with the dry tannins from the sherry casks and a bitter chocolate ending. 

This dram from the island of Jura has won a few awards, but it was not very compatible with my palate this time around unfortunately. I'm tasting more Juras and it will be interesting to see the differences!
