4.0,"This particular bottle is 8 years, 6 months old, barreled in January of 2011. The color is a glowing and intense, dark amber that leaves plenty of oil clinging to the glass, but perhaps not as much as you would expect. The nose is gentle, just like the 13 year old, and presents a variety of soft baking spices backed up by oak. Citrus follows and is backed up by vanilla and caramel, almost butterscotch like. The palate is warm with baking spices, somewhat rich, and fills the mouth with a soft butterscotch that gives the mouth a very creamy feel. Citrus appears as the richness fades, offering a sweetness that wraps up the palate. The finish is medium long and oaky with baking spices that has a fading butterscotch richness that leaves a sweet and creamy aftertaste. Despite its 107 proof, this is a very gentle and soft bourbon. Could use a bit more intensity, but the palate is there for a classically rich and creamy bourbon."

4.5,Beautiful darker golden amber color. Beading is small and viscous. Pleasantly mellow nose of buttery toast and cinnamon with complex notes of florals and fruits following. Initial sip has a decent burn due to high proof with lingering flavors of molasses and brown sugar. Nice full body with spice. Sharp lingering finish deep into stomach. A few drops of water really open up the sweeter floral flavors without diminishing the pleasant warmth.

4.5,"Baker’s 107 Single Barrel (1-2011, 8.5 years old). Beautiful new bottle design for the Beam higher end brand Baker’s. The release changes from a small batch to a single barrel as well. This release is 8.5 years old. Pours a lovely copper into the glass. Nose of vanilla, oak, peanut brittle. The palate hits you perfectly - some heat, but still not too hot - and has a delicate harmony of the Beam peanut character along side some sweeter notes; as you swallow toward the finish you get a rush of oak notes from the barrel almost reminiscent of a very good oaky scotch. The finish has length - peanut skin, spice. Overall a welcome refresh to this brand and a worthy addition to this segment for Beam Suntory. 92-94"
4.25,"Nose:  sweet fruit with vanilla and orange

Palate: rich full slight sweetness and baking spice

Finish: medium rich with slight heat but smooth for the proof

Must have on the shelf and a surprise from JimBeam"

4.25,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 11

I first had Bakers standard at Jim Beam. I didn’t like it at all, but I don’t remember why. I also wasn’t a huge fan of any bourbon at the time, and the only one of the machine squirts I actually enjoyed was Kathleen’s Batch. A lot has changed, and this bottle is an 8.5 year aged single barrel version. When I bought it, I honesty thought it was the one being sold all over secondary (Baker’s 13). Was a bit disappointed when I figured it out, but still intrigued. Before I bought it I asked a shelf-stocker at my honey hole if this was a noticeably different flavor profile from Bakers 7 Small Batch, and he wisely shrugged and said, “You should buy it and come back and let me know.” So here we are.

The nose is floral and fresh. There’s a honeysuckle sweetness there too, and a bit of lemon. It’s a really solid nose.

The flavors on the body don’t stand out as strongly as some bourbons, but I think that’s less a statement of flavor fullness and more of flavor compatibility. The lemon is there, but as it is in lemonade; no bitterness. Sweetness come mainly via a syrup note, but I can get powdered sugar instead at times.

Finish is mild on flavor, but buzzes the bejesus out of your lips and back of tongue. I like that combo a lot. A slight bitterness kicks in on the backend via a sweet tea note.

The one word that summarizes this drink: compatibility. It doesn’t make any crazy bold attempts, but it pulls in a lot of enjoyable notes that work together well. Just finished 2 fingers, going to go pour another 2. Very happy to have this bottle, and I will likely buy another if available once this runs out. Additionally, I would like to formally apologize to the Baker’s line for all the shade I’ve thrown over the past 1.5 years. I may have told an employee at Jim Beam that it tasted like Glenmorangie Lasanta had an unwanted lovechild with Knob Creek, and I especially apologize for that. You’ve produced something excellent here. Let’s makeup under the mistletoe.

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 20 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."

3.5,"Bottle 000186129 (WH CL-D) 8.5 years.  I really like the original, and based on the sheer nonsense of decoration and words on this bottle, I fear the worst.

Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has some cherry cola, Dr. Pepper spice, vanilla, oak.  Some heat coming through.  Taste is more of the same, amplified by the heat.  Second and third sips are more smooth, as my palate adjusts to the spice and heat.  Splash of water brings out a bitterness, like birch.  I just don't know about this one.  I  can say that I prefer the former ""multi-barrel.""  12/9/19"

4.0,Sweet and spicy.
4.25,"Neat. 8.5 year. Neck pour.  Lighter on the nose than expected for the age and proof.  Lots of light, bright notes.  Vanilla.  Apple. Only a slight hint of nuttiness.  Very slight oak.  Baking spice.  Surprised by how little I can get from this nose.  It’s opening up a bit as I sit with it.

Creamy mouth feel, very smooth texture.  Light on the tongue again.  Powder sugar and apple.  Oh there is that Beam flavor profile.  Man.  There is a surprising depth all the sudden.  The nuttiness and oak come through kicking but fade into vanilla, caramels, strawberries, maple.  Delicious legs for miles.  I like it a lot.  

Going back to the nose I can’t believe how muted I’m the nose is and how much flavor comes on the taste.  I am getting more and more from the nose as time goes on.  Despite the nose, the taste is awesome."
4.0,"Nose - cherry cola, butterscotch, cocoa, vanilla, orange. 

Taste - rich sweetness, vanilla, rich dark chocolate, light oak, effervescent, strong but pleasant bite finishing sweet and clean with a beautiful chocolate send-off."
4.0,"Bakers 7 year, but this bottle is aged 8 years 6 months. 

Nose features a healthy amount of cherry, some vanilla bean, corn dust, campfire smoke, and a hint of bubblegum. A very faint nose for a 107 proof whisky. 

Palate opens up with caramel and cherry. As it turns to the mid-palate it smoothly transitions to cinnamon and oak. So far nothing to write home about.

The finish...oh my god the finish! HUGE savory char flavor; I mean like the thick charred crust on a well done grilled ribeye. Proof also hits here with some prickly alcohol heat. The finish is of ungodly length, with the charcoal and ethanol almost blending into a mint long after the other notes fade (over a minute) Coats the tongue and settles in and hangs there with along with the flavor achieves a drying effect which invites you to take another sip.

Hands down the smokiest bourbon I have ever had, almost edging into Scotch territory. Since I love char/smoke, I also loved this bourbon. At $57, I feel I got what I paid for big time. This being a single barrel product, I hope I didn’t just get a honey barrel. As it stands, a rebuy and a recommend."

4.0,Enjoy this one more than the previous small batch. I think it’s a little sweeter and it hides its alcohol better with more cinnamon spice. I get a vanilla with a little beam funk that I often enjoy in Bookers. Barrel Char flavor is present but not as dominant as it often times is in a Knob Creek Single barrel.

4.5,"Taste:  1.5 oz in glen cairn, neat. Side by side blind tasting with Baker's 13. Sample from Dave John.

Nose (4.25):  Vanilla, caramel, cashews, and more vanilla!  This is a delicious bourbon nose, and is truly indicative of sime of the amazing bourbons that come frim Beam.

Palate (4.5):  Caramel turns to a delicious butterscotch, and oak starts to come through.  This oak is a little more raw  There is some spicier notes that hit you mid palate.  I detected a little bit of nutmeg and allspice in that mid palate and a burst of chocolate rounding it out.  

Finish (4.75):  Finish is super on this one.  A sweet, creamy, buttery french vanilla is a punctuation point on a fantastically good whiskey.

Overall:  I loved Baker's 13.  It was one of my votes for best new whiskey release this year.  What I didn't like was the price of Baker's 13.  Although it is in a really cool box, has a really sexy metal bottle-neck tag, I hate to feel that some of my dollars are lost on needless packaging (I have bemoaned WT Master's Keep offerings for same, yet I love them!)  Baker's 7 keeps the cool neck tag, get's rid of the industrially cool silver box, and is 6 years give or take tje junior.  Although I clearly and successfully identified B13 and B7 after a few tastes of each, and had a slight (very slight) favor to B13 for being a bit oaky and spicier, if both bottles were in the shelf and price played a factor I would go with B7.  The $30 or so less for B7 does not translate to $30 less quality, or taste. The less time in the wood doesn't prove a problem at all, and this really hots the sweet spot. Either way you can't lose, but I always like having an extra $30 toward my next bottle.  Cheers!"

2.75,"8 years 6 months. Good nose, with sweetness, some astringent wood, and a whiff of bananas. Pleasant. On the palate, the nose carries over. Sweet, astringent, fruit, a bit of cinnamon spice that lingers. Hint of leather. Pleasant dram but not too smooth, when you want a little extra. The wood note is a bit too much for my liking, but I can see people liking this. 1/17/20"

Not too sweet vanilla and carmel on the nose mingles well with oak char and some notes of fennel and licorice. Palate has the vanilla and oak char flavors while more peanut and some tannins follow. Finish is short-moderate and it slick but not really heavy. 
Solid find for under $50, but I wouldn't pay more than that for it."

I know everyones tastes are different but this is what I like in a bourbon, has some sweetness,plenty of tasting notes (#flava) and at 107 has some proof and doesn't have the watered down - thin- I'm trying to sell as many bottles as possible taste. Thank God theirs no buffalo on the bottle and hopefully this one keeps flying under the radar, more for the true bourbon lovers."

4.25,"I’ve just finished a bottle of the older label Baker‘s that was just a small batch, not a single barrel like it is now. At 8yrs and 3 months let’s see how this new single barrel version of Baker’s  compares to the sample of the old label small batch I kept for this occasion.

The nose has peanut brittle (the peanuts jump out of the glass), barrel char, caramel, some dark stone fruit like a plumb, sweet vanilla and baking spices.

The palate has a nice oily mouthfeel with some peanuts, sweet caramel, cherries and vanilla.

The finish is long with lingering vanilla and dark fruit on the back of the palate. There’s a slow burn in the upper part of the chest. Very nice.

I really like this one. I love the mixture of peanuts, sweet caramel and fruit and how they mix together for a thick oily experience.
The original by comparison is less oily and has rye spice that pokes out above the other mentioned notes and seems a little subdued overall. So I have to say, at least this particular single barrel is a great improvement on an already fantastic bourbon. Way to go Beam!"

Nose: toasted oak, Carmel, subtle vanilla, sugarcane or toffee

Body: my first reaction is sweet and spicy, vanilla comes out strong to me, not a lot of burn and touches each part of the tongue without much harshness. 

Finish: a little more powerful than I was expecting for a 107 proof.  Also, spicier than I was expecting given the sweetness on the nose and body.

I really enjoy Beam products and this didn't disappoint but it didn't blow my socks off either. A different type of daily drinker.

Would buy again and will keep in rotation for awhile."
3.5,"Baker's Single Barrel: Barrel #148840 - Warehouse CL5 Age-7yr 8mo

APPEARANCE: Let me say that I really like the new bottle. It toes the line between unique and gimmicky, but doesn't cross it. It does lose points that upon popping the cork, you discover that it's synthetic. Pours into the Glencairn a rich Auburn color and forms slow moving fat droplets.
NOSE: Oak, Cinnamon, Corn Dust, Orange Peel, Dry Brown Sugar, Clove, and Rye Spice. A litte Heat from the proof as well. The nose on the empty glass is Dark Chocolate.
NEAT:  The first sip is Oak Heavy and Slightly Bitter. Subsequent sips are Slightly Astringent and yield Vanilla, Citrus Oil, and Black Pepper Tingle. A nice building KY Hug in the chest while Tingly Bitter Oak and Citrus coat and layer the palate.
SPLASH: Smooths out the heat on the nose and really makes the Brown Sugar pop. The Beam Peanut Note makes its first appearance on both nose and palate. The palate gets a nice note of Vanilla Coke. I actually think this one might perform well in a rocks glass with a large cube, though I rarely do that with bourbons in this price point.
VERDICT: I was slightly disappointed in this one. It really needed a couple splashes of water to tame the bitterness and bring out the sweetness that I remember from the standard Baker's. This is a Single Barrel, so your results may differ from mine. If it should change with time open I will definitely update my review, but for now it's a disappointing 3 1/2."
