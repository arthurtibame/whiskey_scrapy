4.25,"2017 AD marks the 2nd release from the Ardnamurchan distillery's spirit series, selected from a mix of peated and unpeated spirits matured in 130 55 litre sherry octaves that matured on the upper floor of their warehousing, then married in ex-Pedro Ximénez casks for an extra four months. It's such a great dram for only 2 years old. I got fermented cabbage on the nose and the palate was truely multi-faceted. Sherry, nuts, smoke, nutmeg, sultanas, and much much more going on.  Around $80USD and worth it. I really need to get a bottle!"
