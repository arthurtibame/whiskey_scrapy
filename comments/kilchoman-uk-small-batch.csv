4.25,"I bought a bottle of Kilchoman UK Small Batch from the Whiskey Exchange a few months ago, and I had assumed it was UK only until I was disabused of that notion about a week ago while visiting San Diego. 

Old Town Tequila (www.oldtowntequila.com) is located (not surprisingly) in the heart of Old Town.  It happens to be in the same building as one of my favorite San Diego restaurants, El Agave.  The store is a bit of a mess - to access some of the shelves, I had to push aside random boxes of unopened stock collecting dust.  But the mess was the furthest thing from my mind as I perused shelves full of excellent and rare bottles of tequila, mezcal, scotch, bourbon and more.  Among those treasures I noticed a bottle of the Small Batch - the US edition.

Subsequently, I've learned that there were approximately 1250 bottles released in both the UK and US.   Other than the UK and US designations, I see no difference between the two. I considered placing my review under the US Small Batch entry requested by @eli-mckenna-weiss, but for for the sake of clarity I opened a new entry. Perhaps there should be a single merged Small Batch entry.

On to the whisky!  This is a very enjoyable Kilchoman.   It's full of flavor, perhaps due to the multiple casks - bourbon, sherry and medeira.  Perhaps also due to the multiple casks, it has a more dense profile than some other Kilchomans, but not overly so.  

This a very pleasant whisky that can be thoroughly enjoyed without deep contemplation. But there are two characteristics are can be best appreciated with mindful sipping.  First, the fruit notes run the gamut from mellow dark fruits to tropical fruits and a hint of lemon cream.  Second, the peat notes are beautiful - a Kilchoman hallmark, in my opinion.  But here, the peat makes a really wonderful transition to chocolate and caramel on the finish.

So pick it up if you find it!  And check out Old Town Tequila if you have the chance.  I picked up several lovely mezcals that I hope to review soon.  But note, while Old Town has some great web offerings, many bottles are not listed online.  Your best option may be a trip to San Diego."
