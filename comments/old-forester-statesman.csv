4.0,"Fresh refreshing smoothness, it quenches my whiskey desire a bit more than most- 

It may not be old juice, but it’s definitely a mature tasting whisky; I’d imagine this is the kind of stuff the wise old timers from well before my time drank- in hand sewn wool suits, with nice silk ties, and a big home cooked meal to come home to every night. 
it has a muted sweetness that’s encompassed by a mature yet subtle oak body. Good, worth the money"

4.0,this bourbon has a rich Carmel flavor and is smooth towards the back. I have the kingsman the Golden circle edition.
3.0,"[1.13.17] Headed out to see the Phantom of the Opera tonight and the classy restaurant stopped carrying Evan Williams. Figured I'd try something new. 

Not a bad whiskey by any means and probably better than the 83 it scored here. Clean, fresh, a bit of vanilla and floral sweetness. But there's just not the depth of flavor I would expect from something name ""Statesman"". I didn't catch the spice or smokiness in this glass. Nice to try, enjoyed the drink but wouldn't buy the bottle. 

[2.5.18] Update. Remember that time I said I wouldn't buy a bottle? Disclaimer is that I would be willing to take one for free. Company gave me a few bottles as a thanks when I left. Almost made me regret leaving. Almost."

4.0,"I am not a huge fan of product tie-ins, but this bourbon was released as part of the marketing blitz for the Kingsman sequel.  Now, it just so happens that the original movie is pretty good, mostly thanks to another star turn from Colin Firth.  Although I haven't seen the sequel and abhor these sorts of cash grabs, there's been some positive buzz about this bourbon, so we took a chance on it.  By this point in the night -- keep in mind this is New Year's Eve -- I wasn't exactly writing down the most detailed or poetic tasting notes I could conjure.  Perhaps I'll just deliver my assessment unfiltered for once, to give a sense of how odd my scribbled notes on the phone can be:  ""Pleasant also rye forward more grain and cola.""  From what I can remember, that sounds about right."

3.0,"A gimmick surely--and overpriced at that--but a gimmick that *almost* works, resulting in a solid straight bourbon. And, I mean, I bought a bottle of it, so what does that say about me? Nose is tart cherry, maple syrup, earthy, spicy. Peanut butter (and yes, as the Distiller tasting notes suggest, peanut brittle too) and caramel. Oatmeal cookies and baking spice. Taste is initially quite sweet--lots of caramel, maple, vanilla, but there's a lingering sour off-ness that I find infests a lot of Old Forester bottles, something a bit ""green,"" if that makes sense. Quite hot at full proof, a drop of water or two helps, though it also quicks up the sweetness even more. Peanut and leather on the finish, almost approaching the territory of Beam funk, and some prickly sour-bitter lumber lingering in the mouth. Not bad, but certainly not worth the price, even if I'm not mad I did pick up a bottle."

Palate:  Nothing like the nose.  Bits of burnt brown sugar, leather, tobacco give way to pepperiness.  Very tasty and interesting. (4/5)

Finish:  Pleasantly caramel, lingers as it coats.  Burn is medium and warming.  All and all an above average finisher (3.5/5)

If 3.5 were option that is where I would put it.  I prefer the Prohibition 1920 which has a much sweeter nose and better developed flavors"

    Surprisingly smooth given the strong nose. Full bodied with warm flavors of caramel and slight butterscotch without being sweet. Butterscotch more pronounced than Jim Beam Black. Does not expand in the mouth like a high proof bourbon. Flavor lingers. Some spice without being prickly.
    
    The Statesman is the most complex of the three by far. Best fullness, most developed flavors, and strongest finish of the three."

5.0,Need a half or quarter star system here guys!  This bourbon isn’t a five but also better than a four.  Nose is strong alcohol at first but becomes quite sweet with time.  Palate is slightly harsh with first sip but with caramel and oak. Finish is quite long for this class of bourbon with more oak and burnt sugar. Quite enjoyable 4.25 stars!

3.75,"Corn-forward with some heat and cologne accents on the nose.
The flavor profile is very understated with an extremely short, woodless backend.
Wood and white pepper spice is dominant at the front end and hits you right away on the roof of your mouth. Further tastes start to display some wood and a subtle tangy citrus aftertaste.
The mouthfeel is right in the middle, neither thin nor thick and buttery.
I must say, this one didn’t start out well for me. However, after giving it some time, I’ve come to find it quite pleasant. It’s not flashy, but it’s got the potential to be someone’s favorite daily-drinker."

On the nose I get smokey sweet vanilla, with some rye and other baking spices. I also get a bright fruit note (red apple) hidden in there.

On the palate I’m surprised by it’s nice thicker mouthfeel. I get vanilla, peppery spiciness, big time oak char, and a little dusty rye. I still get some fruit, but not sure what type.

The finish is is on the shorter side of long with some sweet spices and light fruit lingering.

This is great. I really enjoyed this bourbon. Enough qualities to keep it interesting and enjoyable, and easy enough to sip. This is one of my favorite Old Forester bourbons next to 1920, their Rye and 1910 (not in that order necessarily)"
3.75,"I heard this was strong. Somebody compared it to a “better Devil’s Cut”. The nose is warm maple. The initial taste is strong and spicy. As it moves around it mellows a little but still retains a spiced nuttiness. It finishes with a bang of flavor, yet goes down incredibly smooth.. which shocked me. The aftertaste is warm and flavorful, but doesn’t leave a burn in your throat.

This was a surprising whiskey. It’s much more complex than it lets on, and is way smoother on the finish than advertised. For bourbon fans who prefer strong whiskeys, or beginners who might be ready to step up beyond the basics, this is a great buy. It’s definitely unique and will be a mainstay in my collection."

Following a splash of limestone water the caramel notes on the nose became a bit more prominent and on the palate the sweetness was much more defined. The finish was a bit more balanced between spiced and sweetness.

2.5,"This far the worst I have tasted of the old forester bourbon’s. Get an alcohol smell with some nutty whiffs and flavor is light, a bit of alcohol but not much else."
4.0,"Smooth start, ends linger with a good burn"

3.25,"Well I love the Kingsmen movies and this is a tribute so it is perfect for my 100th taste! Nose is typical bourbon corn and brown sugar. Flavor on this is a bit disappointing. Heavy on the alcohol burn that overshadows the brown sugar that screams to come through. Was so hopeful for this to at least be decent, but was ultimately let down."
4.0,Slight hint of peat and peanut brittle with sweet smooth finish

3.0,"As others have noted, it’s spicy on the palate and burns a bit going down. It’s kind of like swallowing a cat. 

Adding a cube of ice definitely opens it up a bit and brings out some sweeter notes.

All in all it’s enjoyable but I prefer the Old Forester 100 proof, which is half the price."

P- warm and smooth- flat

3.0,"Trying this one again with a single cube after opened up some.

Nose - peanuts, vanilla, light leather and maybe even some maple notes

Taste- ice helps mellow out most the spiciness and burn that comes along with this one. Roll it around to tongue and really get the spicy notes this one has still. Sweet vanilla and maple taste with spice.

Overall and value - smells better than it tastes. Personally I’m not very much into the spicy bourbons, but this is still good. It’s got the old forester brand, a cool logo and decent looking bottle. My issue is this drinks more like a 30$ bottle range and not a 50-60$ bottle. 
A quick summary Decent drinker, great nose, spicy maple flavors, but overpriced for what you get"
4.5,Extremely smooth for the proof. Lingering burn but velvety at first.
3.75,Enjoyable with ice. Not complex. Straightforward.

4.25,I like it first off.  Nose is alcohol and sweet.  Palate is cinnamon and sweet.  Finish is hot with pepper and cinnamon.  It’s nothing fancy and there isn’t a ton of depth but it hits all the right spots for me.  It drinks hotter than its proof which is usually the sign of young juice.  Cheers

4.0,"Strong nosing of rubbing alcohol when at room temp right out of the bottle. High vapor. Very harsh at first taste but settles well on the tongue and the swallow is quite nice. The bit on the profile about the large ice cube really does settle the vapors and help disperse the flavors. Makes for easy nosing, taste, body, and swallow."
