4.0,"This one plays with the senses, hitting major bourbon nose and tasting notes! Nose of rye spices and slight barrel. Full, oily mouth feel. Taste is slightly sweet with lots of corn and more spice. Ends with cinnamon and mild heat, given the high proof. The finish is only medium, not like the usual never-ending hug from Bookers other offerings. 2 ice cubes, patio, mild summer night...and the last day of school for a teacher!!! Heavenly start to a summer!!!"

4.0,So different and so good with drops of water added. Before you really do taste the barrel... borderline too much imo. But after the drops of water it's just smooth and full flavored!

4.0,"A great bourbon for special occasions. The 60%+ alcohol content is easily felt, but there's enough spice and sweetness in the flavor to back it up. Great for a long sip."

5.0,"Tommy's Batch has a familiar Booker's nose that makes my mouth water.  Cherry is the first aroma that jumps from the glass along with vanilla, caramel and spicy oak.  As the whiskey settles down I also pick up some mint and a hint of dill.  On the palate there is caramel and pepper followed by a burst of heat that leads to a big oak note.  Out of that oak note comes mint, vanilla, cherry cola and brown sugar.  The vanilla and oak carry through to the finish, and as the oak fades the vanilla grows in intensity.  Cherries make an encore appearance, and the peppery spice is replaced with cinnamon.  On the whole it's another excellent small batch offering from Booker's. 4.5 stars."

3.5,It’s hot! @ DB’s.
5.0,"This whiskey brings the heat. On the nose you get some aged leather and spicy vanilla. There is a heavy spice flavor that tastes of smoke, spices (light pepper/cinnamon, and campfire. The finish is a perfect length. Excellent whiskey."
4.0,Great stuff. Even at a high proof it has a ton of great bourbon flavor. Perfect on a big rock to tame it a bit.
4.5,"At first it’s a sweet oily corn, with spicy vanilla, honey,  caramel, and a hint of molasses to follow. Somewhere in the middle getting an ever so slight metallic tinge (slight, but good, adding to complexity). Absolutely love this on the rocks, as the water brings open the caramel and honey even more.
Long, long, long caramel finish."
4.75,"Great flavor. A few small cubes open it up. Burn is good with ice, and probably the most flavorful bourbon I’ve had. Carmel and wood, then spice, a little leather and a long finish. Cinnamon at the end. Excellent. Great spice."

5.0,Really good bourbon that will put some hair on your chest! Has a caramel nose to it. Drinks smooth but you certainly feel it in your chest. Finish is a bit spicy
4.25,"A classic Booker's. Very nice aroma, flavorful but smooth. This and Sip A While (2017-4) which has a lot more vanilla spice are the best of a good year."

4.25,"Bourbon, but big, bad, and in your face. The alcohol burn is apparent in both the nose and the taste. Notes of nutmeg, heavy cream, dark candied fruits, and sweet spices. This combination lends itself to eggnog. The taste is all oak and bitterness up front. Underlying sweetness makes the bitterness resemble a high cacao content dark chocolate. The long lingering finish is full of honey sweetness and a palate covering warm ness. Delightful."
4.5,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 17

When I first got into bourbon, I made the decision to collect 2 things. I’ve made many more collection decisions since then, but on day 1, at a random liquor store near Bardstown, my decision was to do the Blanton’s letter catch-em all challenge, and to pick a batch and start collecting all Booker’s from that batch on. The batch I picked was 2015.01 (mainly because back then I couldn’t understand the pre-2015 batch nomenclature). To date, I have collected them all up to 2019.03, including the 30th anniversary bottle. But in doing this December experiment, I’ve learned something. Booker’s are for drinking, not saving.

Tommy’s Batch, or 2017.01, comes in at 64.25%.

I think my default stance on Booker’s nose is positive. They’re all classic bourbon noses, but the astringency blocks much of what’s going on until you’re a good finger in. This one is no different. Starting out, I get honey, powdered sugar, and a few singed nose hairs. After I go back, toward the end of the drink, I can also pick out some pecan and pepper.

Hot damn. Not for the faint of heart nor the chapped of lips, this one. I get a dark chocolate here, more bitter than sweet. There’s also a ton of leather. I’d say overall, the leather wins.

Finish brings me brine and black pepper. Very salty, very dry feeling. Pleasant buzz on the sides of your tongue.

With ice: wow, the nuttiness really pops on the nose now. It’s definitely become the main actor. A little sugar still, but most of the scents are gone. The leather on the body is now pleasantly subdued for the preferable (in my opinion) dark chocolate. It’s still bitter and dry, but more like a Cabernet and less like the underside of a frequently used but infrequently cleaned saddle. Finish is more of an afterthought in this mode, but if I had to pick a flavor, I’d say walnuts. Those really bitter ones.

I’m actually getting excited about the (have to guess here because I have such a bourbon hoarding problem that I don’t actually know) 30+ bottles of Booker’s I am officially authorizing myself to consume. Booker’s will never be my favorite bourbon, but what’s cool about the product line is every now and then they do something better that the generally recognized champ. I’d put “Off Your Rocker” in a blind competition for best representation of milk chocolate. Bring your champion, no stave finishes allowed. In the obscure category of “Best in show once poured over ice and allowed to sit for about 5 minutes”, I’d say this guy wouldn’t win, but he’d beat both Blanton’s SFTB and Blanton’s Gold. I’m calling them out because that’s honesty what this reminds me of when you water it down a bit. It’s good juice, and I guess that’s my point. Christmas came early this year in Milliardo’s man cave.

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 14 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments. Don’t say WLW."

4.5,"This is a formidable bourbon, that needs to be respected. You don’t just pour a glass and knock it back. You need to pour a ounce or two, let it rest, take a whiff, and prepare yourself. The nose is candied Apple and baking spice, with strong oak and vanilla. The palette is a cascade of caramel, with such a rich texture it completely costs your tongue. Take a moment, let it sit, enjoy it on your tongue, and finally once you’ve worked through the layers then finish your sip. I’ve owned 9 different variations of Bookers, and this might be the best"
