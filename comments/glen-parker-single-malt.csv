3.0,"Nose: Apple and malt. Slight citrus notes. Pretty subtle overall.

Palate: Some smoke to it. Malty as well. Some hints of fruit and a little peaty.

Finish: Medium-long. Similar to the palate. A little smokier. Simple.

Overall Thoughts: It’s nothing special but it’s not bad by any means. There’s not an awful lot to say about it aside from the fact that it would be something to drink to pass the time. Probably would be enjoyable to have while watching sports or mindless TV programs."
