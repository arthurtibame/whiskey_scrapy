4.0,"Not what I prefer because it is to sweet for me and the ABV is low. This is a smooth mild spirit, we'll made and has a great price point about $30 USD for 750ml you can keep for yourself, give as a gift, or share with friends! This is the hardest to find of the CR flavors.

3.5,"sweeter than I prefer, but delicious in that it is a natural sweetness of honey.  it tastes like real honey, not artificial.  they balanced the honey flavor as perfect as they could, not too much not too little. it has the typical smooth whiskey flavor of the original, very clean honey finish.  3.5 stars"

4.0,"At first taste over my kitchen bar, I was struck by how sweet the 70 proof spirt came across. But was pleasantly surprised by the true honey taste... not simply a ""sugary"" sweet. I was quick to give it a 3. But the next day... while lounging in the pool on a 100 degree day, it was easily a 4 while ove ice. Very light and refreshing on a hot day, especially for a whisky. An interesting blend I'm happy I sampled"
