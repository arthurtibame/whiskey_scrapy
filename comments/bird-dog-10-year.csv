3.0,"$40 here in MI. Not worth the price IMO.( see 2nd review)  Not a lot of flavor. Some bitternes. Fairly fruity. I prefer a darker, dark oakier bourbon. It has sweetness, some burn which is about 50/50 alcohol to tanins. The oak is a fresh oak...not a charred older oak. I like the 12yr Elijah Craig, 12 ECBP, and Knob creek 9yr...darker less ""bright"" bourbons. Maybe this will be your thing...but it isn't mine.
      
      Later review....After the bottle has had a week opened and then letting the pour sit in the glass for 10-15mins. Some of the brighter fruit flavors give way to to the darker carmel flavors. I find this a good thing. Still a little tingling on the tongue but the finish has a much sweeter/caramel taste and actually more than average smoky/char to it. The bitterness remains from start to finish. This would BE WORTH $40 if this is the profile you like...much improved over time...but still not one of my top likes ....3.5 stars"

3.5,Pretty solid whiskey. Approachable. Like it lots for the price.
3.75,BBF tasting. Pretty good stuff.
4.25,"A nice, smooth ten year. Vanilla is intense on the front. Woody, with notes of orange, apricot, cinnamon and chocolate. Like sitting on a back porch at sunset."

3.5,"Surprisingly nice bourbon.  Maybe comes off as a tad younger that a typical 10 year old.  Tasting green apples and pear, that moves to some dark chocolate and cinnamon.  Caramel with a hint of something floral on the finish. A good one for everyone’s bar.  Probably would make a great Manhattan as well."

2.75,Mild pleasant wood flavor. A bit too much burn.
3.5,"A freind of mine picked this up and brought it over, told me it was really good. By itself this is a smooth solid well aged bourbon. To its demise, it taste younger than the age statement. That said, their and no harsh elements to be noted in this bottle. 

To compare i took another 10 year old bottle and compared the two, eagle rare vs bird dog 10yr. Same age, similar mash, same abv, both have badass animals on the label, and heck the bottles are even shaped similarly. Everyone knows eagle rare, so here goes my best quick comparison.

Eagle rare is almost flat in comparison to the profile of bird dog. When compared side by side, you get fruit notes on the first sip that don’t exist in eagle rare. The flavors then take a fork in the road. ER goes off in a more astringent-medicinal direction, but bird dog goes the path of whiskey, think old traditionals like jack Daniel’s and jim beam-with more flavor. 

So in all, i like em both. I think bird dog has a flavor edge in the face off, but ER comes in $10-15 per bottle cheaper. In the end, you should own both."

2.0,"I enjoyed the nose, but the palate seemed dank. Kind of like licking a concrete basement floor. I would not buy it again."
2.75,Not too bad if you can get this bottle under 35.  Nothing amazingly stand out about this bourbon. Has a weird sour oak taste similar to Texas bourbons. Not my favorite but better than some.  A little fuel and rye bite it finishes quickly. Buttery and microwaved popcorn oil in your mouth when done.
4.5,"Super smooth, great flavor, woody"
4.0,"Smooth, good flavor, good aroma. Strong oak flavor. Great bourbon."
3.25,For spending 10 years in a barrel it taste much young. I taste citrus on the front end with some spice finish. There is much better juice on the market for this price range.

4.25,"I don’t see how any Bourbon fanatic could give this less than a 4. Extremely tasty, dynamic bourbon that should be a staple in your collection. Smooth as most other 10 years and the price makes it an even better buy!"

4.0,I think this 10 year bourbon stands up to most other 10 years. Doesn’t finish as smooth as your Eagle Rare’s or your McKenna but a very good bourbon for the $$. I like to keep a bottle in my bar.
3.0,"Color: I’m currently comparing this 10 year old with its standard NAS younger brother. The color is noticeably darker, the color of polished mahogany. Also the legs are more viscous than the entry level Bird Dog and they stick around for a bit.

Nose: This bourbon has a darker, sweeter, and more complex nose than the other. Cherries, pine, vanilla, as well as cut grass notes take you on a little adventure. There are heavy oak notes woven throughout too.

Taste: Sweet apples mingle with oaky notes on the forefront. Cherries come back to the palate too. Salted caramel candy you'd give your wife as a gift definitely contrasts the Halloween reject taste of the standard Bird Dog.

Finish: The long finish starts out sweet, but still leaves your mouth with the feeling of a dry wine. There's a Redvine candy flavor you're left with as well. 

Thoughts: This bourbon definitely steps up Bird Dog’s game. It's tasty and complex, without being overwhelming. Though they may specialize in flavored whiskey, their 10 year old can really stand on its own. Well done guys!"

2.0,Very very sweet. Not worth the price.
3.0,"Was overpriced IMO, cinnamon burn at the end.. kind of sweet."

3.0,"Nose - Sweet vanilla, caramel, hint of oaky simple, light fresh cherry/strawberry notes.

Taste - Sweet oaky vanilla, caramel, light cinnamon burn, light green oak sapling bitterness throughout, fairly thin mouthfeel.

Finish - Lingering cinnamon tingle, sweet vanilla caramel simple syrup, light green sapling bitterness lingers.

Score - 77/100

Final Thoughts - This one had a pleasant nose and very typical bourbon notes. I think this would have done a bit better if it hadn't been for this odd lightly off-putting notes of a bitter green sapling like bitterness I got throughout on the palate & finish that I didn't get in the nose. Not too bad overall, but the bitterness throws it a bit off balance and is just distracting enough.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another one"
