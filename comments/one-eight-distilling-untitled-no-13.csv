4.5,"Picked this up in DC for celebrating the holidays with family there. Really enjoyed it, in many ways reminds me of High West’s Midwinters Night Dram. Based on how little was left in the bottle, it was the family favorite out of 6 or so bourbons, ryes, and Irish whiskies."
5.0,One Eight Distilling did an amazing job with the cask finish on this awesome 10 year old MGP sourced Bourbon. This had a similar complexity to the other Washington DC MGP sourced bourbon at Joseph A. Magnus
