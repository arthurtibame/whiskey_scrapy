3.25,This is the updated version of their 12 year whisky and new bottle design. It is definitely a step up from the old green bottle. This is double oak which gives it a sweeter profile compared to the old bottling.

2.75,"Nose: Definitely pear first, honey second, and a floral vanilla third.  Sometimes it smells more like rootbeer. 
Palate: You can taste the oak. Neutral flavor, has sweetness but also pepperiness that lingers.

This is one where reducing the time in your mouth returns a better flavor experience i.e. don't swish it around, just let it glide across your tongue and swallow."

null,A little more expensive than the Founders reserve but worth it. Both the founders and the double barrel should at all times be in your collection. An everyday Scotch for a long night/trip.
3.5,Smooth. Light.
2.5,"Harsh, whiskey-like"
3.25,"Nose: vanilla, pear, honey, zest, green apple, apricot, toffee. 

Taste: honey and peach/pear mostly. Apple and light oak. Not as complex as the nose. 

Light finish with darker fruit notes, heather honey, and pepper."

4.0,"Nose: floral, wet morning garden, sweet, baked blondies, clean dishes

Taste: honey, apple, smooth processed juice texture,

Finish: short, white wine, tajin on an apple?

	Thoughts: very easy to drink, almost no bite, would share with friends. Almost no finish at all, but very unbothered when drinking this."
